<h1>Jordanis (Jornandes)</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Historian</a>, lived about the middle of the sixth century in the Eastern Roman Empire. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was of high standing, either Goth or Alanic, and his grandfather was notary to Candac, King of the Alani in M&aelig;sia. He himself held for a time the office of notary, though under what circumstances is not well known. He was later "converted", that is, he took orders. Everything else that is reported of his life rests on more or less plausible conjecture. It is not really proven, for example, that he bore "before his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>" the martial name of Jornandes (i.e. bold as a boar), nor that after this conversion he became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in Thrace or in M&aelig;sia. It is also uncertain whether he was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Croton, and whether the Vigilius, to whom he dedicated his second work, was Pope Vigilies, who from 547 to 554 lived in exile, chiefly at Constantinople. Two of his historical works have come down to us. The one is a history of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, or, perhaps it would be better to say, of M&aelig;sia, it is now commonly entitled: "Do origine actibusque Getarum" and is dedicated to his friend Castulus (Castalius), at whose instance it was begun about 551. It is substantially an extract from the Gothic history of <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> Senator, which probably bore the same title. But as this latter work was lost at a very early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, this excerpt becomes of almost inestimable value in determining a series of facts in the history of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> and of popular migrations. Naturally, Jordanis transplanted into his work the fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a>, namely the conviction that the only way to secure for the Gothic race a prosperous future was to bring about its peaceful absorption into the Roman Empire as the centre of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and of civilization. The second of his works is sometimes called "De summa temporum, vel origine actibusque gentis Romanorum", sometimes "De regnorum et temporum successione", at other times "Liber de origine mundi et actibus Romanorum ceterarumque gentium", and again "De gestis Romanorum". Jordanis served as a source of information for the geographers of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, for <a href="../cathen/11591b.htm">Paul the Deacon</a>, for <a href="../cathen/07266a.htm">Hermann Contractus</a>, <a href="../cathen/07519a.htm">Hugh of Flavigny</a>, and others. The following, among some forty editions, are worth noting: Augsburg 1015, of the recension of <a href="../cathen/11784d.htm">Conrad Peutinger</a>; <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> P.L. LXIX; Mommsen in "Monumenta Germ. Auctores antigenssimi" V; Germ. tr. in the "Geschichtsschreiber der deutschen Vorzeit", V; Fr. tr. by Savagner (Paris, 1842 and 1883); <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> translation by Peringski&ouml;ld (Stockholm, 1719).
