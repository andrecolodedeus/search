<h1>Jordanus (Jordanis) de Nemore</h1>  

<p>The name given in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries to a mathematician who in the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> period was called Jordanus Nemorarius. A number of his works are extant, but nothing is known of his life. It is customary to place him early in the thirteenth century. Emile Chasles, the geometrician, concluded from a study of the "Algorismus Jordani" that its author lived not later than the twelfth century. In the fourteenth century the English <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/15063b.htm">Nicolas Triveth</a>, in a chronicle of his order, attributed the "De ponderibus Jordani" and the "De lineis datis Jordani" to Jordanus Saxo, who, in 1222, succeeded <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> as master general of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a>. Since then, the identity of Jordanus Saxo with Jordanus Nemorarius has been accepted by a great many authors; it seems difficult to maintain this opinion, however, as the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> superior general never adds <em>de Nemore</em> to his name, and the mathematician never calls himself Saxo. The literal translation of <em>Jordanus de Nemore</em> (Giordano of Nemi) would indicate that he was an Italian. Jordanus had a great vogue during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. In the "Opus Majus", under "De communibus natur&aelig;", <a href="../cathen/13111b.htm">Roger Bacon</a> quotes his "De ponderibus", as well as a commentary which had been written on it at that period. <a href="../cathen/14693b.htm">Thomas Bradwardine</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logicians</a> who succeeded him in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Oxford likewise make a great deal of use of the writings of Jordanus. During the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> his "De ponderibus" powerfully influenced the development of the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of statics.

<p>The treatises composed by Jordanus de Nemore are: (1) "Algorismus", a theory of the elementary operations of arithmetic. An "Algorithmus demonstratus Jordani" was printed at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> in 1534, by Petreius for Johannes Sch&ouml;ner. The "Algorithmus" reproduced an anonymous <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> found among the papers of Regiomontanus. It was <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> attributed to Jordanus, and had really been composed in the thirteenth century by a certain Magister Gernardus (Duhem in "Bibliotheca mathematica", 3rd series, VI, 1905, p. 9). The genuine "Demonstrato Algorismi" of Jordanus, which E. Chasles had already examined, has been rediscovered by M. A. A. Bjornb&ouml; (G. Enestr&ouml;m in "Bibliotheca mathematica", 3rd series, VII, 1906, p. 24), but is still unpublished. (2) "Elementa Arismetic&aelig;": this treatise on arithmetic, divided into <em>distinctiones</em>, was printed at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1496 and in 1514, to the order of <a href="../cathen/09114b.htm">Lef&egrave;vre d'Etaples</a>, who added various propositions to it. (3) "De numeris datis", published in 1879 by Treutlein ("Zeitschr. Math. Phys.", XXIV, supplem., pp. 127-66) and again in 1891 by Maximillian Curtze (ibid., XXXVI, "Histor. liter. Abtheilung", pp. 1-23, 41-63, 81-95, 121-38). (4) "De triangulis".--Jordanus himself gave this treatise the name of Philotechnes (Duhem in "Bibliotheca mathematica", 3rd series, V, 1905, p. 321; "Archiv f&uuml;r die Geschichte der Naturwissenschaften und der Technik", I, 1909, p. 88). It was published by M. Curtze ("Mittheil. der Copernicusvereins f&uuml;r Wissenschaft und Kunst", VI--Thorn, 1887). (5) "Planispherium".--This work on map-drawing gives, for the first time, the theorem: The stereographic projection of a circle is a circle. It was printed by Valderus, at Basle, in 1536, in a collection containing the cosmographical works of Ziegler, Proclus, Berosius, and Theon of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, and the "Planisphere" of Ptolemy. (6) "De Speculis", a treatise on catoptics, still unedited. (7) "De ponderibus", or better, "Elementa super demonstrationem ponderis", a treatise on statics, in nine propositions, still unpublished, seems to have been composed as an introduction to a fragment on the Roman balance attributed to one Charistion, contemporary and friend of Philo of Byzantium (second century, B.C.). This fragment has survived under two forms: (a) a Latin version directly form the Greek, entitled "De canonio"; (b) a ninth-century commentary by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> mathematician Th&acirc;bit ibn Kurrah, translated into Latin by <a href="../cathen/06468a.htm">Gerard of Cremona</a>.

<p>Most of the propositions of the "De ponderibus Jordani" are gravely <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>. But the last offers a remarkable demonstration of the principle of the lever, introducing the method of virtual work for the first time in mathematical history. Towards the end of the fourteenth century, or the beginning of the fifteenth, an anonymous author expanded the demonstrations in Jordanus's treatise; in this enlarged form, the treatise, combined with the "De cannio", is found in many <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> under the title "Liber Euclidis de ponderibus". There is also an anonymous commentary on the "De ponderibus", based on <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> apparently borrowed from <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> "Qu&aelig;stiones mechanic&aelig;". This <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> commentary is mentioned by <a href="../cathen/13111b.htm">Roger Bacon</a> in his "Opus majus"; together with an enlarged edition of the "Liber Euclidis de ponderibus", it was printed at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, in 1533, by Johannes Petreius, under the direction of Petrus Apianus, under the title "Liber Jordani Nemorarii, viri clarissimi, de ponderibus". In the thirteenth century an anonymous author undertook to write a preamble to a fragment on mechanics, this fragment being of Hellenic origin, and, apparently, later than Hero of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. For this purpose he resumed Jordanus's work, correcting, however, its <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> in mechanics. The method of virtual work, employed by Jordanus to justify the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of equilibrium of the straight lever, supplies this anonymous writer with some admirable demonstrations for the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of equilibrium of the bent lever and for the apparent weight of a heavy body on an inclined plane. This preamble is found in many <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, with the Hellenic fragment. In 1554 it was cynically plagiarized by Nicol&ograve; Tartaglia in his "Quesiti et inventioni diverse"; the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> text, found in Trataglia's papers, was published at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, in 1565, by Antius Trojanus, under the title: "Jordani Opusculum de ponderositate, Nicolai Tartale&aelig; studio correctum" (A <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> Work of Jordanus, on Ponderosity, carefully corrected by Nicol&ograve; Tartaglia).
