<h1>Jorge De Montemayor</h1>  

<p>(MONTEM&Ocirc;R)

<p>A writer, born at Montem&ocirc;r, province of Coimbra, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, about 1520; died at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, 26 February, 1561. Although of Portuguese birth, Montemayor occupies a prominent place in the history of Spanish letters. Little is known of his life. We are informed, however, that he was not a man of <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> training, being not even acquainted with Latin.

<p>The work which has given him fame is his pastoral novel "La Diana", published, according to common report, at <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, in 1542, but thought by others, from allusions in the work itself, to have been published after 1554, probably in 1558 or 1559. This book which for a long time served as a model for novels of its kind, is written in good Spanish, and in it the author describes certain incidents in his own life, among others an unfortunate <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> affair. The portions written in verse are not as meritorious as those written in prose. The author promises a sequel which never appeared. Three other "Dianas" appeared, however, which purported to be continuations of Montemayor's. One by Alonzo Perez, a physician of Salamanca, who claimed that Montemayor had entrusted to him his plans for finishing the work, appeared in 1564 and was a failure. The two others, by Gaspar Gil Polo in 1564 and by Jer&oacute;nimo de Tajada in 1627, were more deserving of praise.

<p>The "Diana" enjoyed great popularity and led to many imitations by famous authors, notably "La Arcadia" of Lope de Vega, and "La Galatea" of Cervantes, and it is said that <a href="../cathen/13748c.htm">Shakespeare</a> based his "Two Gentlemen of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>" upon an episode in "La Diana". It went through many editions both in and out of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. There are six French, two German, and one English translation of the book, the latter the work of Bartholomew Young (London, 1598). Montemayor has also left a number of lyric poems, published in 1554 under the title of "Cancionero", and reprinted in 1562, 1572, and 1588. These are also written in <a href="../cathen/14192a.htm">Spanish</a> but are not of any particular merit.
