<h1>Josef Fessler</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Polten in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and secretary of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>; b. 2 December, 1813, at Lochau near Bregenz in the Vorarlberg; d. 25 April, 1872. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were peasants. He early showed great abilities. His classical studies were done at Feldkirch his philosophy at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a> including a year of legal studies, and has <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1837, and, after a year as master in a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>, studied for two more years in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> life then became professor of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> and canon law in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a>, 1841-52. He published at the quest of the Episcopal Conferenee of Wurzburg, in 1848, a useful little book "Ueber die Provincial-Concilien und Di&ouml;cesan-Synoden" (Innsbruck, 1849), and in 1850-1 the well-known "Institutiones Patrologiae quas ad frequentiorem utiliorem et faciliorem SS. Patrum lectionem promovendam concinnavit J. Fessler" (Innsbruck, 2 Vols. 8vo). This excellent work superseded the unfinished books of M&ouml;hler and <a href="../cathen/11697a.htm">Permaneder</a> and was not surpassed by the subsequent works of <a href="../cathen/01375a.htm">Alzog</a> and <a href="../cathen/11084b.htm">Nirschl</a>. In its new edition by the late <a href="../cathen/08566b.htm">Prof. Jungmann</a> of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> (Innsbruck, 1890-6), it is still of great value to the student, in spite of the newer information given by Bardenhewer. From 1856 to 1861 Fessler was professor of canon law in the University Of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, after making special studies for six months at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as assistant <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a>, Dr. Gasser, on 31 March, 1862, and became his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> for the Vorarlberg. On 23 Sept., 1864, he was named by the emperor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Polten, not far from <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. When at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1867 he was named assistant at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne. In 1869 <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a> proposed Bishop Fessler to the Congregation for the direction of the coming <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> as secretary to the council. The appointment was well received, the only objection being from Cardinal Caterini who thought the choice of an Austrian might make the other nations jealous. Bishop Fessler was informed of his appointment on 27 March, and as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> wished him to come with all speed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he arrived there on 8 July, after hastily dispatching the business of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He had a pro-secretary and two assistants. It was certainly wise to choose a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> whose vast and intimate acquaintance with the Fathers and with <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> was equalled only by his thorough <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of canon law. He seems to have given universal satisfaction by his work as secretary, but the burden was a heavy one, and in spite of his excellent constitution his untiring labours were thought to have been the cause of his early death. Before the council he published an opportune work "Das letzte und das n&auml;chste allgemeine Konsil" (Freiburg, 1869) and after the council he replied in a masterly brochure to the attack on the council by Dr. Schulte, professor of canon law and German law at Prague. Dr. Schulte's pamphlet on the power of the Roman <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> over princes, countries, peoples, and <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, in the light of their acts since the reign of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, was very similar in character to the Vaticanism pamphlet of Mr. Gladstone, and rested on just the same fundamental misunderstanding of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">Papal Infallibility</a> as defined by the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government promptly appointed Dr. Schute to a professorship at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a>, while it <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Fessler's reply, "Die wahre und die falsche Unfehlbarkeit der P&auml;pste" (Vienna, 1871), was translated into French by Cosquin editor of "Le Fran&ccedil;ais", and into English by <a href="../cathen/13354a.htm">Father Ambrose St. John</a>, of the Birmingham Oratory (The True and False Infallibility of the Popes, London, 1875). It is still an exceedingly valuable explanation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">Infallibility</a> as taught by the great Italian "Ultramontane" <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> in the sixteenth century, <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">P. Ballerini</a> in the eighteenth, and <a href="../cathen/11702b.htm">Perrone</a> in the nineteenth. But it was difficult for those who had been fighting against the definition to realize that the Infallibilists "had wanted no more than this. Bishop Hefele of <a href="../cathen/13207b.htm">Rottenburg</a>, who had strongly opposed the definition and afterwards loyally accepted it, said he entirely agree with the moderate view taken by Bishop Fessler, but <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> whether such views would be accepted as sound in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It was clear, one would have thought, that the secretary of the council was likely to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; and the hesitations of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and learned Hefele were removed by the warm <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> which <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> addressed to the author.
