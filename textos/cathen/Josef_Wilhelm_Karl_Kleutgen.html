<h1>Josef Wilhelm Karl Kleutgen</h1>  

<p>German <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, b. at Dortmund, <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, 9 April, 1811; d. at St. Anton near Kaltern, Tyrol, 13 Jan., 1883. He began his studies with the intention of becoming a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but owing to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> atmosphere of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which he attended, his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for religion gradually cooled. From 28 April, 1830, to 8 Jan., 1831, he studied philology at the University of Munich. He was intensely interested in <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> philosophy and the Greek tragic poets. Though he clung to the Faith, it ceased to be the ruling principle of his life, and he fell into a deep melancholy. In this state he was about to enter upon a secular career, when he suddenly received what he always regarded as a special illumination from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Still he was not at rest. During the preceding years he had imbibed certain <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> from Lessing's and <a href="../cathen/07251c.htm">Herder's</a> writings, which he could not reconcile with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>. After several weeks of internal conflict he betook himself to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and to his astonishment many of his difficulties vanished at once; the remainder disappeared gradually. At <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1832 he entered the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> academy of Munster, and after two terms went to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> on 22 Feb., 1834. On 28 April he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at Brig, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and, to avoid any trouble with the German Government in the matter of military service, he became a naturalized citizen in one of the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> cantons, and changed his name to "Peters". After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in 1837 he was professor of ethics in Fribourg, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, for two years; he then taught rhetoric in Brig from 1840 till 1843. In 1843 he was appointed professor of sacred eloquence in the German College, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>During his residence in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the vicinity (1843-74), besides pastoral work and the composition of his principal writings, he was substitute to the secretary of the general of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (1843-56), secretary (1856-62), consultor of the Congregation of the Index, and collaborator in the preparation of the Constitution "De fide Catholica" of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. He composed the first draft of the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "&AElig;terni Patris" of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> on <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> (1879). He played a leading part in the revival of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a> arid <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, and so thorough was his mastery of the teachings of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> that he was called <em>Thomas redivivus</em> (Thomas returned to life). With the object of combating the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">Hermes</a>, Hirscher, and Gunther, he composed his "Theologie der Vorzeit" and "Philosophie der Verzeit", works which upon their appearance were pronounced in many quarters to be epoch-making. When he died, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> said of him: "Erat princeps philosophorum" (he was the prince of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>). Some years before the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> Kleutgen was confessor extraordinary to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Convent of St. Ambrose in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a saint one of their sisters who had died fifty years before. This was reported to the Holy Office and everyone concerned was severely punished; Kleutgen and the ordinary confessor (both men of exceptionally holy lives) were suspended, because of lack of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in directing the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, for awhile even from saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>.

<p>Kleutgen consequently left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and went to the secluded shrine of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> in Galoro, where he wrote the greater part of his "Theologie der Vorzeit" and "Philosophie der Vorzeit". After the opening of the council, at the urgent request of several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, especially Archbishop Stein, Apostolic Vicar of <a href="../cathen/03152a.htm">Calcutta</a>, his superior general recalled him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to place his talents and learning at the disposal of the council, and <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> removed all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> censures as soon as he became acquainted with the work which Kleutgen had written. In 1879 some <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a> spread the report that Kleutgen had been condemned by the Roman <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> to an <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of six years on account of complicity in the poisoning of a Princess von Hohenlohe; but, on 7 March, Juvenal Pelami, Notary of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, testified that Kleutgen had never been summoned before the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> upon such a charge, and consequently had not been punished by it. Possessed of high gifts and vast erudition, and, in consequence, very much in the public eye, Kleutgen was also a model religious and a man of austerely simple life. He was very fond of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and they in turn almost worshipped him. When he preached, his plain, straightforward, simple language had an appeal even for the intelligence of the most illiterate; and when in conversation with the learned, who often came to consult him, his flow of speech was as free, copious, and unembarrassed as though he were reading from a book.

<p>Kleutgen's principal works are: "Die alten und die neuen Schulen" (Mainz, 1846, M&uuml;nster, 1869); "Ueber den Glauben an das Wunderbare" (M&uuml;nster, 1846); "Ars dicendi" (Rome, 1847; Turin, 1903); "Die Theologie der Vorzeit" (3 vols., M&uuml;nster, 1853-60, 5 vols., 1867-74), "Leben frommer Diener und Dienerinnen Gottes" (M&uuml;nster, 1869); "Die Philosophie der Vorzeit" (2 vols., M&uuml;nster, 1860-3; Innsbruck, 1878), translated into French and Italian; "Die Verurteilung des Ontologismus" (M&uuml;nster, 1868); translated into French and Italian; "Zu meiner Rechtfertigung" (M&uuml;nster, 1868); "Vom intellectus agens und den angeborenen Ideen"; "Zur Lehre vom Glauben" (M&uuml;nster, 1875); "Die Ideale und ihre wahre Verwirklichung" (Frankfurt, 1868); "Ueber die Wunsche, Befurehtungen und Hoffnungen in Betreff der bevorstehenden Kirehenversammlung" (M&uuml;nster, 1869); "Briefe aus Rom" (M&uuml;nster, 1869), "Predigten" (Regenbburg, 1872; 2 vols., 1880-5); "Die oberste Lehrgewalt des r&ouml;mischen Bischofs" (Trier, 1870), "De ipso Deo" (Ratisbon, 1881); "Das evangelium des heiligen Matth&auml;us" (Freiburg, 1882).
