<h1>Joseph-Marie, Comte de Maistre</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> writer, b. at <a href="../cathen/03566c.htm">Chamb&eacute;ry</a>, in <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, in 1753, when <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> did not belong to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, 26 Feb., 1821. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, which was of French origin, had settled in <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> a century earlier, and had attained a high position, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> being president of the Senate. Joseph, the eldest of ten children, was a pupil of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who, like his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, inspired him with an intense <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of religion and detestation of the eighteenth-century <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>, which he always resolutely opposed. In 1774 he entered the magistracy; in 1780 he was assistant fiscal advocate general; in 1788 he was appointed senator, being then thirt-five years old. Four years later, he was forced to fly before the invading French, and discharged for four years at <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a> a confidential mission for his sovereign, the King of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>. That monarch having lost the capital of his kingdom, de Maistre lived in poverty at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, but on the restoration of the king, went to <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> as keeper of the great seal (1799) and, three years later, to St. Petersburg, as plenipotentiary. This mission lasted fourteen years, till 1817. Though weakly supported by his Government, which was at times displeased with his frankness, poor amidst a lavish aristocracy, he nevertheless successfully defended the interests of his country with the Czar Alexander, who, like most of the leading personages at St. Petersburg, highly appreciated his character and his ability. He afterwards returned to <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, to fill the post of minister of State and keeper of the great seal until his death.

<p>The writings of Joseph de Maistre (as well as those of his younger brother &mdash; <a href="../cathen/09555a.htm">Xavier de Maistre</a>) were all in French, then the literary language of <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>. Joseph's first important work was written during his sojourn in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. He was then forty years of age. He had previously composed some speeches and a few comparatively unimportant essays. We may mention "L'&eacute;loge de Victor Am&eacute;d&eacute;e III", attacking the intolerance which had lighted the fires of the stake, and glorifying the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the Americans against their oppressors. After the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, he published some writings on current events, e.g. "Discours &agrave; M. le Marquis Costa de Beauregard sur la vie et la mort de ton fils" and "Cinq paradoxes a la Marquise de Nav . . ." (1795). In the following year appeared his "Considerations sur la France" (London and Lausanne, in folio); although its dissemination was rigorously forbidden by the French authorities, several editions were exhausted within a year. The author maintains the thesis that <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> has a mission from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: she is the principal instrument of good and of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> on earth. De Maistre looks on the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> as a providential occurrence: the monarchy, the aristocracy, the whole of the old French <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, instead of turning the powerful influence of French civilization to benefit <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, had used it to foster the doctrines of the eighteenth-century <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>: the crimes of the Reign of Terror were the punishment thus merited. The author added that the foreign nations were dupes of a foolish dream, in undertaking the dismemberment of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, "the most beautiful kingdom after that of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>". Finally, he predicted a speedy restoration, and disappearance of the abuses of the past.

<p>In connection with this work must be mentioned a little book composed in 1809, under the title "Essai sur le principe g&eacute;n&eacute;rateur des constitutions politiques et des autres institutions humaines". Its main <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is, that constitutions are not the artificial products of the study but come in due time and under suitable circumstances from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who slowly brings them to maturity. After the appearance in 1816 of the treatise "Sur les d&eacute;lais de la justice divine dans la punition des coupables", translated from Plutarch, with additions and notes, Joseph de Maistre published at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in 1819 his masterpiece "Du Pape". The work (2 vols. in 8vo.) is divided into four parts. In the first the author proves that in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is sovereign, and that it is an essential characteristic of all sovereign power that that its decisions should be subject to no appeal. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> declarations of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> are binding on man without right of appeal. Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> in his teaching, since it is by his teaching that he exercises his sovereignty. And in point of fact "no <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>, speaking freely to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, has ever made a mistake in the matter of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>". In the remaining divisions of his work the author examines the relations of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the temporal powers: civilization and the welfare of nations; the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> Churches. He establishes that nations require to be guaranteed against abuses of the power to which they are subject by a sovereignty superior to all others; now, this sovereignty can be none but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, which, even in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, had, in fact, already saved <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> civilization from the barbarians. As to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> Churches, the writer thinks that they will inevitably fall into <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, and from <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> through <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinianism</a> into philosophic indifference. For "no religion can resist <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, except one."

<p>The treatise, "L'&Eacute;glise Gallicane dans ses rapports avec les souverains pontifes" (Paris, 1821, in 8vo), formed, in the original plan of the author, the fifth part of the preceding work. De Maistre at the last moment resolved on the advice of his friends, to make it a separate work. He discusses vigorously, and at times, from the Gallican standpoint, harshly, the celebrated Declaration of the Assembl&eacute;e of 1682. Besides a voluminous correspondence, Joseph de Maistre left two posthumous works. One of these, "L'examen de la Philosophiede Bacon", (Paris, 1836; 2 vols in 8vo), is an attack on Locke and Condillac, and in general on the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the eighteenth century, in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whom the author considers as the father of their system. This work is not among the most highly esteemed of De Maistre's writings. The "Soir&eacute;es de St. P&eacute;tersbourg" (Paris, 1821, 2 vols, 8vo) is a reply in the form of a dialogue to the objection against Providence drawn from the existence of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the world. For Joseph de Maistre, the existence of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, far from obscuring the designs of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, throws a new light on them; for the moral world and the physical world are inter-related. Physical <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> exists only because there has been, and there is, moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. All wrong must he expiated. So humanity which has always believed in the necessity of this expiation, has had recourse, to accomplish it, not only to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, but to sacrifice, that is, the shedding of blood, the merits of the innocent being applied to the guilty &mdash; a law as mysterious as it is indubitable, and which, in the opinion of the author, explains the existence and the perpetuity of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The fame of Joseph de Maistre has been enhanced too, by his "Correspondance". Almost six hundred of his letters have been preserved. In them one finds the tender father, the loving, devoted friend, and at the same time a keen, ingenious, unaffected, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyous</a> writer. His complete works were published in fourteen volumes, 8vo, at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 1884-87.

<p>To appreciate de Maistre in his writings as a whole, one may remark that his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are bold and penetrating, and his views so clear and accurate that at times they seem prophetic. An enthusiastic believer in the principle of authority, which the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> tried to destroy, he defends it everywhere: in the State by extolling the monarchy, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by exalting the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>; in the world by glorifying the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and the conduct of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. His style is strong, lively, picturesque; animation and good humour temper his dogmatic tone, and he might even be deemed eloquent. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> he does not disdain paradox in his thinking or <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> in his language: he has neither the moderation nor the serenity of <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>. But he possesses a wonderful facility in exposition, precision of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, breadth of learning, and <a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">dialectical</a> power. He influenced the age that followed him: he dealt Gallicanism such decisive blows that it never rose again. In a word, he was a great and virtuous man, a profound thinker, and one of the finest writers of that <a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French language</a> of which his works are a distinguished ornament.
