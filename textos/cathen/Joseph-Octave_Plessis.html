<h1>Joseph-Octave Plessis</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec, born at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, 3 March, 1763; died at Quebec, 4 Dec., 1822. He studied classics at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> and philosophy at Quebec, was appointed in 1783 secretary to Bishop Briand, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1786. In 1797 he was named <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and chosen for coadjutor. The bulls having been delayed by the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> and death of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, Plessis was only <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1801. He assumed the greater part of the administration, his superior remaining at Longueuil; by the latter's death in 1806 he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec. The programme of the oligarchy then in power comprised the organization of an exclusively <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system; and the subjection of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> influence to the royal supremacy and the governor's good pleasure, in the erection of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>. Plessis's aim was to obtain the civil recognition of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, without forfeiting any right or privilege of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. His title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec, assumed by all his predecessors before and since the Conquest, was odious to the officials and to the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Plessis, by his firm yet deferential attitude, his <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and moderation, and his loyalty to the Crown, removed all opposition. He wisely resisted every offer of temporal betterment to maintain the fulness of his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a>. When the American Congress in 1812 declared <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, Plessis aroused the loyalty of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a>, who by remarkable victories, notably at Ch&acirc;teauguay, saved <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> to Great Britain. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with a seat in the Legislative Council, his title and dignity officially recognized, and the creation of <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a> in Upper <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <a href="../cathen/11135a.htm">Nova Scotia</a>, and Prince Edward Island approved of. He succeeded in preventing the application of the odious monopolizing <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> law called the "Royal Institution". An energetic and enlightened patron of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, he redeemed Nicolet College, generously contributing to reorganize, enlarge, and endow it; he likewise favoured the foundation of St-Hyacinthe College, whose regulations he wrote, and established a Latin <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at St-Roch to prepare students for <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> or college.

<p>Three times after his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> he visited every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in Lower <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>; in 1811 and 1812 he travelled through the Maritime Provinces, and in 1816 to Upper <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Long since convinced of the necessity of dividing his immense diocese, he strove to create new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. Nova Scotia was separated in 1817. To realize the formation of other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in Upper <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, in the North-West, in Prince Edward Island, and at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, Plessis crossed the Atlantic in 1819 to negotiate with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Anticipating the conclusion of the case pending before the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had made Quebec a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>, with two of the above-named for suffragans. The new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> successfully counteracted English susceptibilities, alarmed at his promotion, and obtained the other two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> he had in view. He likewise succeeded in preventing the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> from losing by expropriation their seigniory of the Island of Montreal. Public opinion had improved since Brand's time. On his return voyage, <a href="../cathen/12165a.htm">Plessis</a>, at the request of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, visited Philadelphia and <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. When in 1822 the House of Commons proposed a bill for the legislative Union of the two Canadas, whereby the French <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> province would have been the sufferer, <a href="../cathen/12165a.htm">Plessis</a>, though stricken with the disease that was to end his life, undertook an active campaign by letter to avert the disaster. His advice and influence strengthened the delegates who had been sent to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to prevent the passing of the bill.
