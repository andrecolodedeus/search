<h1>Joseph Anthelmi</h1>  

<p>A French <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical historian</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/06269a.htm">Fr&eacute;jus</a>, 25 July, 1648; d. in the same city, 21 June, 1697. Several of his ancestors had occupied <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonries</a> in their native place, the history and traditions of which they had investigated and preserved. Joseph, feeling himself called to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, betook himself to <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, where he entered on the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> under the celebrated <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> P&egrave;re Lachaise, afterwards confessor to <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>. On being <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, he returned to Provence, and was soon made canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/06269a.htm">Fr&eacute;jus</a>, notwithstanding his natural dislike for a position so ill according with his habits of retirement and study. His uncles, Pierre and Nicolas, had published a work on the former incumbents of the <a href="../cathen/06269a.htm">See of Fr&eacute;jus</a>; and following in their footsteps, Joseph resolved to devote himself especially to the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> in his native land, beginning with his own diocese. His first work appeared in 1680, "De inito ecclesiae Forojuliensis dissertatio chronologica, critica, profano-sacra". The learned but <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erring</a> <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Pasquier Quesnel</a>, once an Oratorian, was then at the height of his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, and was agitating <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> on the question of the real author of the "De vocatione gentium", the "Responsiones pro Augustino ad Capitula Gallorum" and the "Epistola ad Demetriadem" (P.L., LI, 647,158; LV, 162). In his opinion these had been written by <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo the Great</a>. Against him Anthelmi now entered the field on behalf of the authorship of <a href="../cathen/12487a.htm">St. Prosper of Aquitaine</a>. The contest was maintained with vigour by both parties, their letters being published in the "Journal des Savants", in 1689. Toward the close of the same year Anthelmi vindicated his position by the publication at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> of his work "De veris operibus SS. Patrum Leonis et Prosperi". The opposition between Anthelmi and <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a> burst cut anew in regard to the authorship of the <a href="../cathen/02033b.htm">Athanasian Creed</a>. <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a> thought it the work of Vigilius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14556a.htm">Thapsus</a>, in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, who towards the end of the fifth century was driven from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> by Huneric, King of the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, and taking refuge in Constantinople wrote against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">Eutychians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, attributing his own works to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>. Anthelmi, on the contrary, inclined to the view of Pere Pithou, who attributed it to <a href="../cathen/15439b.htm">St. Vincent of L&eacute;rins</a>; and in 1693 he published his "Nova de symbolo Athanasiano disquisitio". In this work Anthelmi endeavoured to prove that the Creed cannot be the production of St. Athanasius, as it was composed not earlier than the fifth century; and that its author was a Gaul. St. Vincent was known to have had the intention of filling out at length a confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the mysteries of the Trinity and the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a>; this, taken in conjunction with the similarity of style and expression between the <a href="../cathen/02033b.htm">Athanasian Creed</a> and the writings of St. Vincent, is the foundation of Anthelmi's argument. His brother, Charles, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Grasse, collected and published several other historical papers, the most notable of which was a pamphlet, "On the Life and Death of <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>". In 1694, Anthelmi was made <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11435b.htm">Pamiers</a>; but his health, already impaired by a life of severe study and unremitting labour, could not stand the additional strain put upon it by his new <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, and he returned to his native city in a vain attempt to recuperate. Here he died in the forty-ninth year of his age.
