<h1>Joseph Caiphas</h1>  

<p>According to <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Antiquitates, XVIII, iv, 3), Caiphas was appointed <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High-Priest of the Jews</a> by the Roman <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> Valerius Gratus, the predecessor of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, about A.D. 18 (Ant., XVIII, ii, 2), and removed from that office by the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> Vitellius, shortly after he took charge of affairs in Palestine, A.D. 36 (Ant., XVIII, iv, 3). During this period the famous <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a>, father-in-law of Caiphas (<a href="../bible/joh018.htm#vrs13">John 18:13</a>), who had been <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> from A.D. 6 to 15, continued to exercise a controlling influence over <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> affairs, as he did when his own sons held the position. This explains the rather puzzling expression of <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs2">Luke 3:2</a>, <em>epi archiereos Anna kai Kaiapha</em> (under the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and Caiphas; cf. <a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs6">Acts 4:6</a>). Caiphas was certainly the only official <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> at the time <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">St. Luke</a> refers to, at the beginning of the public life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; but <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> still had his former title and a good deal of his former authority. The role assigned him in the trial of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in John 18, points to the same continued influence. In the measures taken by the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> authorities to do away with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, Caiphas certainly had the most discreditable part. After the raising of <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> held council to determine what was to be done in view of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">manifest signs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Prophet of Nazarus</a> and what they were pleased to consider the danger resulting to the country. The words of Caiphas, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> of that year, are reported by <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John</a>: "You know nothing. Neither do you consider that it is expedient to you that one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not" (<a href="../bible/joh011.htm#vrs49">11:49-50</a>). They show a disdain for others, and a determination to get rid of this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who was displeasing to him, without any consideration of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of his cause. But while we may see in the declaration of Caiphas the manifestation of very unworthy sentiments, we are warned by <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">St. John</a> that it was <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetical</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> expressed in a striking way the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">sufferings of the Man-God</a> (<a href="../bible/joh011.htm#vrs51">John 11:51-52</a>), though he could not have realized the full import of those mysterious words. The death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> being resolved upon, the most unscrupulous means were employed in order to bring it about, and Caiphas is chiefly to blame. The meeting determined upon by the princes of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the elders of the people, "that by subtlety they might apprehend <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>", was held in the house of Caiphas (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs3">Matthew 26:3-5</a>). The hill south of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> where this house is said by tradition to have stood is called the "Hill of Evil Counsel". As <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a>, Caiphas was the official head of the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a>, and consequently responsible for the travesty of a trial to which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was submitted by the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> authorities, before they handed Him over to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> and stirred up the people to demand his death.

<p>After the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, Caiphas continued to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> his followers. When <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a> were brought before the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Council</a> after the cure of the lame <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> at the Beautiful Gate of the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">Temple</a> (<a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs6">Acts 4:6 sqq.</a>), Caiphas was still <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a>, since he was removed A.D. 36 or 37. We can say with almost equal certainty that he was the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> before whom <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">St. Stephen</a> appeared (<a href="../bible/act007.htm#vrs1">Acts 7:1</a>), and that it is from him that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Saul</a> obtained letters authorizing him to bring the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a> to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs1">Acts 9:1-2</a>). At a time when <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priests</a> were made and unmade by officials of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and when the principal quality required seems to have been subserviency, it is no credit to the <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> of Caiphas to have enjoyed their favour so long. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> mentions his rule in connection with a series of acts of Vitellius which were agreeable to the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>. We are not told what became of him after his deposition.
