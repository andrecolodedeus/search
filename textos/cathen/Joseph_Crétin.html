<h1>Joseph Cr&eacute;tin</h1>  

<p>First <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> b. at Montluel, department of Ain, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 19 December, 1799; d. at <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, 22 February, 1857. He made his preparatory studies in the Petits s&eacute;minaires of Meximieux (Ain) and L'Argenti&egrave;re (Rh&ocirc;ne), his studies of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at Alix (Rh&ocirc;ne), and of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Saint-Sulpice, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 20 December, 1823, and soon afterward was appointed vicar in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> at Ferney, once the home of Voltaire, and eventually became its <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He built there a new and beautiful church with funds largely gathered by himself on a tour through <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, founded a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for boys, and revived the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> among his parishioners, many of whom had become indifferent towards it, owing to the surviving influence of "the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>" and the close proximity of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> cantons of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. But Cr&eacute;tin longed for a larger field of activity; at one time he thought earnestly of going as a missionary to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. His perplexities in that regard were solved by the advent of Bishop Loras, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, who arrived in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1838 in search of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for his Western diocese. Cr&eacute;tin was one of the few who volunteered and on 16 August, 1838, he secretly left his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, embarked at Le Havre with Bishop Loras, and landed in New York in October of the same year. The winter of 1838-39 was spent in St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, and on his arrival in <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, 18 April, 1839, he was at once appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the new diocese. For over eleven years he exercised his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> ministry in these new and unopened regions, dividing his time chiefly between Dubuque <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, Prairie du Chien, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, and the Winnebago Indians in the neighborhood of Fort Atkinson, Winnieshiek Co., <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>. Only once, in 1847, did he absent himself, when he made a trip to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in the interest of his missions. In 1850, <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>, became the seat of a new diocese. Cr&eacute;tin was appointed its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 26 January, 1851, at <a href="../cathen/02415a.htm">Belley</a> by Bishop Devie, who had <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> him to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.

<p>After having obtained some donations and several <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> for his new diocese, he returned to America and arrived in <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, 2 July, 1851. The same evening he made his first appearance in the log <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Paul, his first <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and gave his first episcopal blessing to his flock. Within less than five months a large brick building was completed, which served as a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, a residence, and a second <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Another structure, begun in 1855, was finished after his death, and serves as the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>. In 1853 a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> was built; during the same year, and again in 1856 he bought land for cemetery purposes. For the instruction of children he introduced, in 1851, a community of the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, and in 1855, the Brothers of the Holy Family. He also planned the erection of a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and always eagerly fostered vocations for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, keeping at his residence seminarians in their last period of preparation. He supported likewise the cause of temperance not only by personal example, but also by organizing, in January, 1852, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Temperance Society of St. Paul, the first of its kind in <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>. Another work to which he applied himself was that of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colonization. With an eye to the future he endeavored to provide for the growth of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by bringing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> immigrants from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> countries to the fertile plains of <a href="../cathen/10326c.htm">Minnesota</a>. Withal he did not neglect his ministerial and pastoral office. He was often alone in <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a> without the help of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and at times travelled through the vast extent of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> bestowing on his people the consolations of religion. Bishop Cr&eacute;tin's memory is held in esteem and veneration, especially by the old settlers of <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>.
