<h1>Joseph Dabrowski</h1>  

<p>Founder of the Sts. Cyril and Methodius Seminary, <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a>, b. at Zoltance, Russian <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, 15 Feb., 1903. He studied at the <em>Gymnasium</em> of <a href="../cathen/09403a.htm">Lublin</a> and at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>. During the Polish Rebellion of 1863 he participated in many engagements, and in 1864 fled to Dresden; thence to Lucerne and Berne where he continued his studies in mathematics. Going to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he came under the direction of the famous Resurrectionist, Father Semenenko, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 1 August, 1869. In 1870 he went to America, and in a letter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 22 Jan., from St. Francis Seminary, <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, to Father Semenenko he betrays a remarkable grasp of the demoralized conditions among the <a href="../cathen/12204c.htm">Poles in the United States</a> of whom he had actually seen so little. He urged the Resurrectionists to come to <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> or Milwaukee and there establish <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> whence they might send out missionaries to the scattered <a href="../cathen/12204c.htm">Poles</a>. In 1870 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Polonia, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, where for five years he fought against the unfortunate conditions existing in one of the oldest <a href="../cathen/12204c.htm">Polish</a> communities in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Unable to close the demoralizing inns about the church he obtained by gift from an Irishman twenty acres of land for the erection of new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> buildings and abandoned the old site. In 1879 the rectory was destroyed by fire and in 1880 fire totally destroyed the church and the new rectory. Undismayed, Father Dabrowski rebuilt all. In 1882 failing health forced him to resign and leave for Detroit, Michigan. In 1874 he introduced into the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the <a href="../cathen/06027b.htm">Felician Sisters</a> from Cracow, whose community multiplied its branches throughout the country, welcoming the immigrants, teaching thousands of Polish children, and caring for a multitude of Polish <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and working girls.

<p>At the suggestion of <a href="../cathen/09111b.htm">Cardinal Ledochowski</a>, who was unable to meet the constant appeals of American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for Polish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students, Father Leopold Moczygemba, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> who had laboured in America and was then penitentiary of St. Peter's, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, went, with <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> approval, to America and collected funds ($8000) for a Polish <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Being advanced in years Father Moczygemba felt unable to prosecute the work with vigour, and entrusted the task to Father Dabrowski. The latter began the building of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in 1884, and on 24 July, 1885, Bishop Ryan of <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a> in the presence of <a href="../cathen/02684c.htm">Bishop Borgess</a> of <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a> blessed the cornerstone. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was opened in 1887, and for nineteen years Father Dabrowski was its <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>. In 1902 it was enlarged, and in 1909 was removed to Orchard Lake, Michigan. Always the champion of authority, his counsel was ever gentle and calm. He was simple, quiet, and retiring, and entirely devoted to the promotion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> glory and the welfare of his fellowmen. A few days before his death Father Dabrowski was compelled to expel from the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> twenty-nine students for open rebellion. On 9 Feb., 1903, he suffered a paralytic stroke and died, grieved by the ingratitude of those whom he had served so nobly and so long.
