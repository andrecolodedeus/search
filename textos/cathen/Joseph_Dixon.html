<h1>Joseph Dixon</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, born at Coalisland, Co. Tyrone, in 1806; died at <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, 29 April, 1866. Having entered <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a> at the age of sixteen he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1829. In 1834 he was appointed to the chair of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> and Hebrew, a post he worthily occupied for the next eighteen years. His class had an average of 200 students, amongst whom was John McEvilly, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a> and a distinguished writer on <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptural</a> subjects. Dr. Dixon's professorship was signalized by his "Introduction to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>", a work highly praised by <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> and which was very much needed at the time. The first edition appeared in 1852 and a second in 1875. As <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Armagh he held an important <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> in 1854, at which all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the northern province assisted with their <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. In the same year he began the heavy task of completed the unfinished <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Armagh and almost accomplished the work before his death. In 1856 he formed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> chapter consisting of thirteen members. During his incumbency he brought some religious congregations into the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, viz. the <a href="../cathen/03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a> (1855), who opened a house in Drogheda; the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marist Fathers</a> (1851) who opened a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> and <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in Dundalk, and the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Vincentian</a> Fathers who were placed in charge of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> the same year. The <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> was a stanch and fearless defender of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and at a public meeting in Drogheda denounced <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a> for complicity in the acts of the Italian revolutionists. His speech and subsequent letter to the "Freeman's Journal" created a great sensation and the emperor made them a subject of complaint to <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> was the organizer of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Brigade in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> service.
