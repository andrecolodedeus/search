<h1>Joseph Epping</h1>  

<p>German <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a> and Assyriologist, b. at Neuenkirchen near Rhine in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, 1 Dec., 1835; d. at Exaeten, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, 22 Aug., 1894. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> died while he was very young, and he owed his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to the fostering care of relations. After completing the usual gymnasium at Rheine and at <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, he matriculated at the academy in <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, where he devoted himself particularly to mathematics. In 1859 he entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a> and after his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies was appointed professor of mathematics and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a> at <a href="../cathen/09658a.htm">Maria-Laach</a>. He spent the years from 1867 to 1871 in the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1870. <a href="../cathen/06379b.htm">Garc&iacute;a Moreno</a>, President of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>, had petitioned the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in the early seventies for members of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> to form the faculty of the Polytechicum at <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a>, which he had recently founded. A number of German <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> responded to the call, among them Epping, who set out in June, 1872, for <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a> to become professor of mathematics. He quickly learned Spanish and was able to write a textbook of geometry in that language. He likewise took an active part in all the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> work of the Fathers. The political disturbances which followed the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">assassination</a> of <a href="../cathen/06379b.htm">Moreno</a> (6 Aug., 1875) made it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to return to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and Epping arrived in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> ion the fall of 1876. He spent the remaining years of his life at Blijenbeck, and later at Exaeten, as professor of <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a> and mathematics to younger members of his order, devoting his leisure to research and literary work.

<p>Epping's first published volume, "Der Kreislauf im Kosmos", appeared in 1882. It was an exposition and critique of the <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>-<a href="../cathen/08796a.htm">Laplace</a> nebular hypothesis and a refutation of the <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> and <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">materialistic</a> conclusions which had been drawn from it. His most important work, however, was begun in collaboration with Father Strassmaier who, in connection with his own studies in Assyriology, had induced him to undertake a mathematical investigation of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> observations and tables. After considerable labour the key was found. He discovered the table of differences for the new moon in one of the tablets, and identified <em>Guttu</em> with Mars, <em>Sakku</em> with Saturn, and <em>Te-ut</em> with Jupiter (Epping and Strassmaier in "Stimmen aus Maria-Laach", vol. 21, pp. 277-292). Eight years later he published "Astronomisches aus Babylon oder das Wissen der Chald&auml;er uuber den gisternten Himmel" (Freiburn im Br., 1889). This work was of much importance both from the standpoint of <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a> and <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a>. It contains an exposition of the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a> of the ancient Babylonians, worked out from their Ephemerides of the moon and the planets. This was supplemented by "Die bablyonische Berechnung des Neumondes" (Stimmen aus Maria-Laach, Vol. XXXIX, pp. 229-240). He was also the author of a number of articles in the "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Assyriologie". Father Epping suffered much from ill-health during the last years of his life. He was none the less a man of untiring activity and combined geniality and a keen sense of humor with a deep and simple <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>.
