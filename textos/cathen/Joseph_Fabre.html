<h1>Joseph Fabre</h1>  

<p>Second Superior General of the <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>, born 14 November, 1824, at Cuges, Bouches-du-Rh&ocirc;ne, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; died at Royaumont near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 26 October, 1892. He first studied at the Lyc&eacute;e of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, then entered the Grand S&eacute;minaire of the same city, and made his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in the Congregation of the Oblates, pronouncing his final <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> 17 February, 1845. After teaching philosophy for some time, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 29 May, 1847. He was Director of the Grand S&eacute;minaire of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> when, in 1850, a general chapter elected him <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of the whole Institute. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, who was also the superior and founder of the Oblates, made him his trusted confidant; and when that <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> died Father Fabre was unanimously chosen to succeed him (5 December, 1861) as Superior General of his congregation in which capacity he from time to time addressed to the members of his congregation, encyclical letters which have remained models of <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a>. He instituted collective retreats for the superiors, and others for the simple religious, and insisted on the observance of charity and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, which <a href="../cathen/10094a.htm">Bishop De Mazenod</a> had made the cardinal virtues of his Institute.

<p>He introduced his missionaries into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>; established new houses in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">Great Britain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and, in 1883, canonically erected into a separate province the houses already existing in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Their activities in the missions of <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>, South Africa, and the extreme North, as well as the far West, of America, were no less remarkable during his tenure of office.

<p>At the time of his death, when he had been superior for thirty-one years, the roll of members had more than doubled in numbers, and the Oblates counted in their ranks ten <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were at the head of as many <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a>. If <a href="../cathen/10094a.htm">Bishop De Mazenod</a> had founded and consolidated the congregation, the last touches to the good work were given by his immediate successor. In addition to bring their superior general, Father Fabre was the Director-General of the Association of the Holy Family, a religious institute composed of seven congregations of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> founded at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> in the first half of the nineteenth century.
