<h1>Joseph Fesch</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/01238b.htm">Ajaccio</a>, <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>, 3 January, 1763; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 13 May, 1839. He was the son of a captain of a <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> regiment in the service of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, studied at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, was made <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the chapter of <a href="../cathen/01238b.htm">Ajaccio</a> before 1789, but was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a> when his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> sided with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> against the English, who came to the island in answer to Paoli's summons. The young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was half-brother to Letizia Ramolino, the mother of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> and upon arriving in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> he entered the commissariat department of the army; later, in 1795, became commissary of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> under <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a>, then in command of the Arm&eacute;e d'Italie. When religious peace was reestablished, Fesch made a month's retreat under the direction of Emery, the superior of Saint-Sulpice and re-entered <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life. During the Consulate he became canon of Bastia and helped to negotiate the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a>; on 15 August, 1802, Caprara <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and in 1803 <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>.

<p>On 4 April, 1803, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> appointed Cardinal Fesch successor to Cacault as ambassador to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, giving him <a href="../cathen/03640a.htm">Chateaubriand</a> for secretary. The early part of his sojourn in the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a> was noted for his differences with <a href="../cathen/03640a.htm">Chateaubriand</a> and his efforts to have the Concordat extended to the Italian Republic. He prevailed upon <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> to go to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in person and crown <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>. This was Fesch's greatest achievement. He accompanied the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and as grand almoner, blessed the marriage of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> and Josephine before the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> took place. By a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> issued in 1805, the missionary institutions of Saint-Lazare and Saint-Sulpice were placed under the direction of Cardinal Fesch, who, laden with this new responsibility, returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1806, after the occupation of <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a> by French troops, and <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> letter proclaiming himself Emperor of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Alquier was named to succeed Fesch as ambassador to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Returning to his archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> remained in close touch with his nephew's religious policy and strove, occasionally with success, to obviate certain irreparable mistakes. He accepted the coadjutorship to Dalberg, prince-primate, in the <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">See of Ratisbon</a>, but, in 1808, refused the emperor's offer of the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, for which he could not have obtained <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a>. Although powerless to prevent either the rupture between <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1809 or the closing of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> of Saint-Lazarre, Saint-Esprit, and the Missions Etrangeres, Fresch nevertheless managed to deter <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> from signing a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> relative to the Gallican Church. He consented to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> marriage with Marie-Louise, but, according the researches of Geoffrey de Grandmaison, he was not responsible to the same extent as the members of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <em>officialit&eacute;</em> for the illegal annulment of the emperor's first marriage.

<p>In 1809 and 1810 Fresch presided over the two ecclesiastical commissions charged with the question of <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but the proceedings were so conducted that neither commission adopted any <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> resolutions. As its president, he opened the National Council od 1811, but at the very outset he took and also administered the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> (<em>forma juramenti professionis fidei</em>) required by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Injunctum nobis" of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>; it was decided by eight votes out of eleven that the method of <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> could not altered independently of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. A message containing the assurance of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> loyalty, and addressed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">supreme pontiff</a>, then in exile at Fontainebleau, caused the Fesch to incur the emperor's disfavour and to forfeit the subsidy of 150,000 florins which he had received as Dalberg's coadjutor. Under the Restoration and the Monarchy of July, Fesch lived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, his <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Archdiocese of Lyons</a> being in charge of an administrator. He died without again returning to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and left a splendid collection of pictures, a part of which was bequeathed to his episcopal city.

<p>As a diplomat, Fesch sometimes employed questionable methods. His relationship to the emperor and his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalitical</a> dignity often made his position a difficult one; at least he could never be accused of approving the violent measures resorted to by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>. As <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, he was largely instrumental in re-establishing the <a href="../cathen/03711c.htm">Brothers of Christian Doctrine</a> and recalling the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, under the name of Pacanarists. The <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Archdiocese of Lyons</a> is indebted to him for some eminently useful institutions. It must be admitted, moreover, that in his pastoral capacity Fesch took a genuine interest in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.
