<h1>Joseph F&uuml;hrich</h1>  

<p>(Born 1800; died 1876.) Joseph F&uuml;hrich was as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in his art as in his life. He was fond of avowing his principles on art with great emphasis; he declares that religion, art, and nature are harmoniously combined in his mind, that he does not admit that ecclesiastical art is its own end, but that its end is to be serviceable in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> house, not as mere decoration, but as a means of instruction, in order to manifest to the heart as far as possible by means of the senses the life of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. As a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> his works, like <a href="../cathen/11362a.htm">Overbeck's</a>, were inspired by <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, while in his conceptions and their expression he resembles <a href="../cathen/04376a.htm">Cornelius</a>. As the son of a poor <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> town of Kratzau, he learned the elements of the art in his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> workshop and practised drawing while keeping his flock, the Christ-Child and the adoration of the shepherds being his favourite subject. His father brought him at the age of sixteen to the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> Bergler in Prague.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">artist</a> was so well pleased with two compositions assigned by him to the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a>, that he advised him to exhibit some of his pictures. Two of them were actually bought, and several art patrons procured for him the funds <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to attend the academy. The reading of Romantic poets soon made a Romanticist of him. <a href="../cathen/04376a.htm">Cornelius's</a> illustrations of "Faust" and <a href="../cathen/11362a.htm">Overbeck's</a> sketch of <a href="../cathen/14463d.htm">Tasso</a> confirmed this tendency. On his journeys to <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a> and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> he became fond of <a href="../cathen/05209c.htm">D&uuml;rer's</a> creations. He illustrated the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> in nine etchings and Tieck's "Genoveva" in fifteen. To the recommendation of some Romanticists he was indebted for the means for a journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which he began towards the end of 1826. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he studied the works of different periods of art, above all acquired the historical style, studied the representation of the great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">Christian mysteries</a>, and modified his method by the study of the works of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> and <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>. Of course he did not fail to become acquainted with <a href="../cathen/01483b.htm">Fra Angelico</a>, a spirit congenial to his own. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he immediately joined the Nazarene School, learned monumental technic, and completed the <a href="../cathen/14463d.htm">Tasso</a> cycle in the Villa Massimi by adding three frescoes: "Armida and Rinaldo", "Armida in the Enchanted Forest", and "The Crusaders at the Holy Sepulchre." The year 1829 saw him again in <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, but in 1834 he went to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where he lived till his death.

<p>It is noteworthy that two of his early pictures, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> shortly after his return, viz. "Jacob and Rachel" and "Mary's Journey over the Mountains", sold for five times the original price, even during his lifetime. In 1841 he became professor in the academy of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and was raised to the <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">order of knighthood</a> in 1854, and was henceforth commonly called Ritter von F&uuml;hrich. Executed with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the same care as the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> just mentioned, are "Booz and Ruth", "St. Gudula", "Christ on His way to the Garden". He <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> religious pictures almost exclusively; of <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old-Testament</a> subjects we may mention: "God writes the Commandments upon the Tables of Stone", "Josue and the destruction of Jericho", "The Sorrowing <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>"; of New -Testament pictures: "Joseph's Dream", "Joseph and Mary on their Way to Jerusalem", "The Birth of Christ", "The Storm on the Sea", "The Miraculous Draught of Fishes". These pictures <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the grandeur and loftiness of religious themes and testify to the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> and <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystical</a> conception of the artist. Purity in form and energy in expression, a simple beauty in movement and dress, without pretension and affectation, are their unmistakable excellencies. The artist's desire to apply the monumental fresco-technic in his native country fulfilled twice. In 1844-46 he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the <a href="../cathen/15569a.htm">Stations of the Cross</a> in the church of St. John Nepomucene in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. The work was appreciated on all sides, and copies of it have reached America and the most distant missions.

<p>In 1854-61 he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a>, together with others, the church of Altlerchenfeld in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. The artist himself has explained to us the plan of this <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> epos. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> activity as the Saviour before, during, and after his earthly career is presented here to the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> as in a great picture Bible; in the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibule</a>, what precedes the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; on the walls of the entrance and in the <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>, the prototypes of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>; in the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, scenes from the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; the pictures in the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> represent the proximate preparation for the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>; over the main altar, the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Crucifixion</a>, and in the choir, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> life in His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The plan, as well as the composition, is magnificent, in the execution he was aided by less skilful hands, and the colouring is at times imperfect, as is the case in most of the works of the Nazarenes. But F&uuml;hrich acquired his greatest fame as a draughts-man. Though we may miss at times individuality, characters drawn from life, and dramatic movement, a fact which will not astonish us, considering the ideal character of his subjects, still he meets the essential requirements of his theme, often enraptures us by his <em>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</em> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, by his noble lines and thoughtful invention. His cyclical pictures have become the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people. The master here achieves his ideal of the artist's work. The artist must be a man of meditation and a man of enthusiasm, who can translate the element of instruction from the purely <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> sphere into that of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, turn mere inspection into <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> cycle or "The Way to Bethlehem" in its twelve numbers contains the most beautiful pictorial idylls. Full of charm and touching is the symbolical figure of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whose attention is first called by the personification of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> to the mystery of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> and which then follows the events with the light of meditation and the inspiration of art. The fifteen pictures of the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> cycle, "He is Risen", surprise us by the fertility of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, by the astonishing skill in the use of symbolical language, by their dignified earnestness and deep <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Equally imperishable works of art are the eleven drawings and etchings entitled "Christ's Triumph". In "Thomas &agrave; Kempis" (to the text of Guido G&ouml;rres) F&uuml;hrich found an opportunity to throw the principal tenets of our religion into poetical form, and at the same time to reveal the wealth of his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> heart.

<p>To these works must be added "The Life of Mary", "The Legend of St. Wendelin", "The Psalter", "Poor Henry", and "Memorials for Our Time". Most of these drawings were made for woodcuts, "The Prodigal Son" and "Ruth" for copperplate engravings. F&uuml;hrich's <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles of &aelig;sthetics are laid down in his beautiful booklet "Von der Kunst" also in "Kunst und ihre Formen." Moreover, we have from his pen "Briefe aus Italien" and an autobiography; a new edition of the latter, prepared by friends and enriched with additions, appeared in 1875 in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>.
