<h1>Joseph Gabriel Rheinberger</h1>  

<p>A composer and <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a>, born at Vaduz, in the Principality of Lichtenstein, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, 17 March, 1839; died at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 25 Nov., 1901. When seven years old, he already served as <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a> in his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, and at the age of eight composed a mass for three voices. After enjoying for a short time the instruction of Choir-master Schmutzer in Feldkirch, he attended the conservatory at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> from 1851 to 1854, and finished his musical <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> with a course under Franz Lachner. In 1859 he was appointed professor of the theory of music and <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a> at the conservatory, a position which he held until a few months before his death. Besides his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as teacher he acted successively as <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a> at the court Church of St. Michael, conductor of the <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> Oratorio Society, and instructor of the solo artists at the royal opera. In 1867 he received the title of royal professor, and became inspector of the newly established royal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for music, now called the Royal Academy of Music. In 1877 he was promoted to the rank of royal court conductor, which position carried with it the direction of the music in the royal <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. Honoured by his prince with the title of nobility and accorded the honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy by the <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> University, Rheinberger for more than forty years wielded as teacher of many of the most gifted young musicians of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and America, perhaps more influence than any of his contemporaries. As a composer he was remarkable for his power of invention, masterful technique, and a noble, solid style. Among his two hundred compositions are <a href="../cathen/11270a.htm">oratorios</a> (notably "Christoforus" and "Monfort"); two operas; cantatas for soli, chorus, and orchestra ("The Star of Bethlehem", "Toggenburg", "Kl&atilde;rchen auf Eberstein" etc.); smaller works for chorus and orchestra; symphonies ("Wallenstein"), overtures, and chamber music for various combinations of instruments, Most important of all his instrumental works are his twenty sonatas for <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a>, the most notable productions in this form since Mendelssohn. Rheinberger wrote many works to <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> texts, namely, twelve masses (one for double chorus, three for four voices <em>a cappella,</em> three for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> voices and <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a>, two for men's voices and one with orchestra), a requiem, <em>Stabat <a href="../cathen/10041a.htm">Mater</a>,</em> and a large number of <a href="../cathen/10600c.htm">motets</a>, and smaller pieces. Rheinbergen's masses rank high as works of art, but some of them are defective in the treatment of the text. Joseph Renner, Jr., has recently remedied most of these defects, and made the masses available for <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> purposes.
