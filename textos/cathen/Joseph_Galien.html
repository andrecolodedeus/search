<h1>Joseph Galien</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/02160a.htm">University of Avignon</a>, meteorologist, <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physicist</a>, and writer on aeronautics; b. 1699, at Saint-Paulien, near <a href="../cathen/09185b.htm">Le Puy</a>, in Southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; d. 1762 in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/09185b.htm">Le Puy</a> &mdash; or, according to other accounts, in 1782 at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. He entered the order at <a href="../cathen/09185b.htm">Le Puy</a>. He studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> institution in <a href="../cathen/02160a.htm">Avignon</a> with such success that he was sent to <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> as professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> as early as 1726. From the year 1745 on he held the chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/02160a.htm">Avignon</a>, and from 1747 the chair of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. He seems to have resigned his professorship in 1751 to devoted his energies entirely to the study of meteorology and physics. He published: "Lettres th&eacute;ologiques touchant l'&eacute;tat de pure nature, la distinction du naturel et du sur-naturel, et les autres mati&egrave;res qui en sont de cons&eacute;quences" (Avignon, 1745); also the "Explication physique des effets de l'&eacute;lectricit&eacute;" (Avignon, 1747). But Galien's most important contribution was a booklet that he issued anonymously in 1755 at <a href="../cathen/02160a.htm">Avignon</a> under the title: "M&eacute;moire touchant la nature et la formation de la gr&ecirc;le et des autres m&eacute;t&eacute;ores qui y ont rapport, avec une cons&eacute;quence ult&eacute;rieure de la possibilit&eacute; de naviger [sic] dans l'air &agrave; la hauteur de la r&eacute;gion de la gr&ecirc;le. Amusement physique et g&eacute;om&eacute;trique". The second edition of this booklet, this time with the name of its author, appeared as early as 1757. The change in its title renders it easy to discern what made the monograph so interesting. It was now called: "L'art de naviguer dans les airs, amusement physique et g&eacute;om&eacute;trique, pr&eacute;c&eacute;d&eacute; d'un m&eacute;moire sur la formation de la gr&ecirc;le." After propounding his theory regarding hail storms, Galien calculates how large an airship would have to be in order to transport an entire army with its equipment to <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> His scheme was to construct a gigantic cube-shaped vessel of good, strong canvas of double thickness plastered with wax and tar, covered with leather and reinforced in places with ropes and rigging; its edge was to be 1000 <em>toises</em> (roughly 6,500 feet), and each surface 1,000,000 sq. <em>toises</em> (approx. 42,250,000 sq. feet) in area. In both length and breadth it would be larger than the city of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and would resemble a fair-sized mountain. This vessel would have to float in the atmospheric strata of the hail belt, as the atmosphere there is a thousand times lighter than water, while in the strata above this, into which the top of the cube would extend, the air is two thousand times lighter than water. For the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> principles of his proposal Galien relied on <a href="../cathen/08772c.htm">Lana, S.J.</a>, perhaps also on <a href="../cathen/13589a.htm">Schott, S.J.</a>* His chief claim to importance lies in the fact that the <a href="../cathen/10541a.htm">Montgolfier</a> brothers were acquainted with him, or at least his booklet. His birthplace was very near to theirs, and like Galien the <a href="../cathen/10541a.htm">Montgolfiers</a> began with meteorological observations; moreover, the elder of the brothers made a first ascension at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in 1782. In aeronautical works Galien is, for the most part, unfairly treated; as the writers assume that his scheme was meant seriously, contrary to his statement given on the title page.
