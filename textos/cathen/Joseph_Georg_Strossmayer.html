<h1>Joseph Georg Strossmayer</h1>  

<p>(Josip Juraj), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04769c.htm">Diakov&aacute;r</a> [Djakovo], born at Essegg [Osijek] in Croatia-Slavonia, 4 February, 1815; died 8 April, 1905. He came from a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of German peasants who had immigrated into <a href="../cathen/04510a.htm">Croatia</a>. After attending the <em>gymnasium</em> of his native town, he studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/04769c.htm">Diakov&aacute;r</a> and the higher <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Budapest, where he obtained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy when only twenty years of age. In 1838 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and was for two years vicar at Peterwardein [Petrovaradin]. In 1840 he went to the Augustineum at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>; in 1842 obtained the degree of Doctor of Theology, and was then made professor at <a href="../cathen/04769c.htm">Diakov&aacute;r</a>. In 1847 he became court <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, prefect in the Augustineum and professor of canon law at the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a>. On 18 November, 1849, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04769c.htm">Diakov&aacute;r</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 8 September, 1850. At the same time he was Apostolic Administrator of Belgrade-Semendria in Serbia. In 1898 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> conferred the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> on him.

<p>At the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> he was one of the most notable opponents of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>, and distinguished himself as a speaker. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> praised Strossmayer's "remarkably good Latin." A speech in which he defended <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> made a great sensation. Afterwards another speech, delivered apparently on 2 June, 1870, was imputed to him. It is full of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and denies not only <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> but also the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a> is said to have been a former Augustinian, a Mexican named Dr. Jos&eacute; Agust&iacute;n de Escudero. After the council Strossmayer maintained his opposition longer than all the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and kept up a connection with <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> and Reinkens until October, 1871. Then he notified them that he intended to yield "at least outwardly". Finally, on 26 December, 1872, he published the decrees of the council in his official paper. At a later date he repeatedly proclaimed his submission to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, as in his pastoral letter of 28 February, 1881, on Sts. Cyril and Methodius, expressing his devotion to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">papal see</a> at times in extravagant language.

<p>In politics he was an active supporter of the Croatian national party and Panslavism. He exerted himself to advance his people in civilization, yet he strengthened national hatreds by his political agitation. He used the large revenues of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to found primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, the academy for southern <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> at <a href="../cathen/01225b.htm">Agram</a> (1867), the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> (1874), and a picture gallery also at <a href="../cathen/01225b.htm">Agram</a>. Under his direction August&iacute;n <a href="../cathen/14565b.htm">Theiner</a> edited the "Vetera monumenta Slavorum meridionalium" (1863). During 1866-82 he built a fine and splendidly ornamented <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. He sought to win the non-Catholic Serbians to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the use of the Old Slavonic liturgy.
