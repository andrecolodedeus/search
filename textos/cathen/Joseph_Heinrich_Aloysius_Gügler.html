<h1>Joseph Heinrich Aloysius G&uuml;gler</h1>  

<p>Born at Udligerschwyl, near <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, 25 August, 1782; died at <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, 28 February, 1827. The only son of simple country people, he was a delicate child and received no regular schooling, but read the books belonging to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> again and again, so that, when only twelve years old, he had read the entire <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> several times. Religiously inclined from childhood, he early desired to enter the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state, and after many entreaties his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> permitted him to begin his studies at the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>. When the storms of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> crossed the Rhine, Abbot Beatus, the religious, and students, in May, 1798, went to the Abbey of St. Gerold, and at the end of the year G&uuml;gler was sent to Petershausen, near <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>. In 1800 he continued his classical course at Solothurn. In 1801 he began philosophy, which he finished with great credit at <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a> according to <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> and Jacobi. Even as a student he showed those opposite traits of character, for which he was noted all through life: a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> ready to overcome any obstacles and fearing no consequences in the defence of right, with at the same time an unobtrusive, almost shrinking nature; a very comprehensive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of men and affairs together with a dread of showing it. During this period he became acquainted with <a href="../cathen/15617b.htm">Widmer</a>, a fellow-student, the acquaintance ripening into a life-long friendship. Through the influence of <a href="../cathen/15617b.htm">Widmer</a>, G&uuml;gler, who had become undecided as to his future career, took up the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, which both pursued at Landshut under Sailer and Zimmer. Shortly before his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> he was appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> at the lyceum in <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>. After he had received <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, 9 March, 1805, at the hands of Testa Ferrata, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, he was made a canon of the collegiate church of <a href="../cathen/09174a.htm">St. Leodegar</a> (Saint-L&eacute;ger), retaining his position as professor of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>. Later he also taught pastoral theology, and 1822-24 acted as prefect of the lyceum.

<p>G&uuml;gler and <a href="../cathen/15617b.htm">Widmer</a>, who had also been made a professor at <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, put new life into the study of the Scriptures, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and cognate branches. Students were encouraged to drop antiquated notions, to think and investigate for themselves, to gain solid <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and to avoid superficiality. The methods of the new teachers brought them into conflict, as well with the supporters of the old <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, as with the followers of <a href="../cathen/15590b.htm">Wessenberg</a> and the "Illuminati" of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> who accused the professors of unchristian <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>. A controversy followed between G&uuml;gler and Thadd&aelig;us M&uuml;ller, city <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, during which appeared, among other writings, G&uuml;gler's "Geist des Christentums und der Literatur im Verh&auml;ltniss zu den Thadd&aelig;us M&uuml;llerschen Schriften". M&uuml;ller made a formal demand to the municipal authorities for the removal of G&uuml;gler from the professorship, which was decreed 12 Dec., 1810. Immediately <a href="../cathen/15617b.htm">Widmer</a> handed in his resignation, a large number of students threatened to leave, and even the majority of citizens sided with G&uuml;gler. M&uuml;ller saw his mistake, and, at his special request G&uuml;gler was reinstated 23 Jan., 1811. G&uuml;gler had also a dispute with Marcus Lutz, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Leufelfingen, and issued the sarcastic pamphlet "Chemische Analyse und Synthese des Marcus Lutz zu Leufelfingen" (1816). Another controversy was with Troxler, who later became known as a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. G&uuml;gler devoted his time chiefly to teaching and to literary work, but he frequently preached, and he wrote a poem for the twenty-fifth anniversary of Sailer's <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. To his scholars he was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> friend, adviser, and consoler. Perhaps the last literary work of G&uuml;gler was a protest against the admission of non-Catholics to the Canton of <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, as he wished to preserve for the people the inestimable boon of unity in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. His career, though short, was a source of great blessing to his country. Sketches of his life were written by <a href="../cathen/15617b.htm">Widmer</a> and Geiger, and his biography was prepared by Joseph L. Schiffmann, "Lebensgeschichte des Chorherrn und Professors Aloys G&uuml;gler" (Augsburg, 1833); a lengthy article on G&uuml;gler and his <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> works appeared in the "Katholik" (1829), XXXIV, 53, 196.

<p>His principal work is: "Die hl. Kunst oder die Kunst der Hebr&auml;er" (1814, 1817, 1818), 3 vols. It is a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> exposition of <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> Revelation undertaken by a mind which gives full credence to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of Revelation, and under the veil of the letter sees hidden treasures of wonderful wisdom which it considers the highest achievement of human investigation to find and give to the world. In 1819 <a href="../cathen/15617b.htm">Widmer</a> published the continuation of this work in relation to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>: "Ziffern der Sphinx oder Typen der Zeit und ihr Deuten auf die Zukunft" (Solothurn, 1819). This wishes to show the divine order of current events which are presented in grand pictures and prophetic visions. A periodical founded by G&uuml;gler in 1823, "Zeichen der Zeit im Guten und B&ouml;sen", was continued by Dr. Segesser. Among G&uuml;gler's published works is a volume entitled "Privatvortr&auml;ge", lectures on the Gospel of St. John, the Epistle to the Hebrews, and the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> of St. Augustine, together with a brief sketch of the sacred books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> (Sarmenstorf, 1842). His posthumous works were edited by <a href="../cathen/15617b.htm">Widmer</a> between 1828 and 1842. A complete list of all his printed works is given in the "Thesaurus librorum rei catholic&aelig;" (W&uuml;rzburg, 1856), I, 337.
