<h1>Joseph Hergenr&ouml;ther</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Church historian</a> and canonist, first Cardinal-Prefect of the <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">Vatican</a> <a href="../cathen/01696a.htm">Archives</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, 15 Sept., 1824; d. at <a href="../cathen/10146d.htm">Mehrerau</a> (Bodensee), 3 Oct., 1890.

<p>He was the second son of Johann Jacob Hergenr&ouml;ther, professor of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> in the University of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>. In 1842 Hergenr&ouml;ther completed with notable success his gymnasium course in his native town, and entered the University of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> to take up a two-year course of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies, to which he added certain branches of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. His historical tendencies exhibited themselves at this early age in a dramatic poem entitled "Papst Gregor VII" (W&uuml;rzburg, 1841). Bishop von Stahl took a lively interest in the promising youth, and in 1844 sent him to the Collegium Germanicum at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, whither he had already sent <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a> and <a href="../cathen/07307a.htm">Hettinger</a>. Among his scholarly teachers were <a href="../cathen/11702b.htm">Perrone</a> and <a href="../cathen/11518b.htm">Passaglia</a> in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, Tomei in <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/16006b.htm">Ballerini</a> in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, <a href="../cathen/11559a.htm">Patrizi</a> in <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">Scriptural exegesis</a>, and Marzio in canon law. The political troubles of 1848 prevented the completion of his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> 28 March of that year, and returned to <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, where he pursued his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> preparation for another year. In 1849 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> at Zellingen, and for some time devoted himself with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office. In 1859 he stood successfully for the degree of doctor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> before the University of Munich, and offered as his dissertation a treatise on the Trinitarian teaching of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a> (Die Lehre von der g&ouml;ttlichen Dreieinigkeit nach d. heil. Gregor von Nazianz, Ratisbon, 1850). The brilliant qualities of the young doctor induced the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> to offer him a place as instructor (<em>privatdozent</em>) in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, which he accepted. Following ancient usage, he justified the confidence of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> by a printed thesis (<em>Habilitationschrift</em>) on the later <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> theories of the origins of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (De catholic&aelig; ecclesi&aelig; primordiis recentiorum Protestantium systemata expenduntur, Ratisbon, 1851). Henceforth he devoted himself without reserve to his professional <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. In 1852 he was called to <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, as professor extraordinary of canon law and <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>; after three years (1855) he was promoted to the full possession of that chair. To his other <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> he added the teaching of patrology. In those years <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> rejoiced in the possession of such brilliant <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> as <a href="../cathen/07307a.htm">Hettinger</a>, <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, H&#228;hnlein, and Hergenr&ouml;ther; their reputation spread far and wide the fame of this old Franconian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Hergenr&ouml;ther was often <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by election to the office of dean of his faculty, and occasionally to the University Senate; the latter office he never held after 1871, because of his opposition to <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>. For a similar reason he was never chosen to be <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Until 1869 Hergenr&ouml;ther was occupied as teacher and writer, chiefly with early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and Byzantine <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>. The discovery (1851) of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Christian</a> text known as the <em>Philosopho&uacute;mena</em> led him to examine its disputed authorship in a series of studies in the "T&uuml;binger Theol. Quartalschrift" (1852) and in the supplementary volume (1856) to the first edition of the "Kirchenlexikon" of <a href="../cathen/15607b.htm">Wetzer</a> and <a href="../cathen/15587a.htm">Welte</a>. He again defended the authorship of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> in the "&OElig;sterreichische Vierteljahrschrift f. kath. Theol." (1863).

<p>Hergenr&ouml;ther was especially interested in the career of Photius and in the origins of the Greek Schism, and kept up continuous research in the principal <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> for <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the works of Photius, in order to exhibit the original materials in as perfect a text as could be established. This led to the publication (Ratisbon, 1857) of the work, "Photii Constantinopolitani Liber de Spiritus Sancti mystagogia". He contributed essays on the same work and on the "Amphilochia" of Photius to the "T&uuml;b. Theol. Quartalschrift" (1858). In 1860 appeared at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> the <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> edition of "Photius" (P.G., CI-CIV). It offered many textual emendations that were owing to Hergenr&ouml;ther, particularly in the "Amphilochia"; it was against his will that his earlier edition of the "Liber de Sp. Sancti mystagogia" was reprinted by <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>. When Pichler's work on the history of the separation of the Eastern and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Churches</a> appeared (Munich, 1864), Hergenr&ouml;ther was prepared to criticize it in the most thorough manner, which he did in a series of studies in a <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> periodical, the "Chilianeum" (1864-65), and in the "Archiv. f. kath. Kirchenrecht" (1864-65). The results of his twelve years of research in the history of the Greek Schism appeared finally in the classical work, "Photius Patriarch von Constantinopel, sein Leben, seine Schriften, und das griechische Schisma" (3 vols., Ratisbon, 1867-69). An additional volume bears the title: "Monumenta Gr&aelig;ca ad Photium ejusque historiam pertinentia" (Ratisbon). In this monumental work it is difficult to say whether the palm belongs to the author's extensive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> material, to his profound erudition, or to his calm objective attitude. Krumbacher, the historian of Byzantine literature, says that the work cannot be surpassed. In these volumes Hergenr&ouml;ther laid here in minute detail the origins of the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a>, its development since the fourth century, and after the death of Photius until the unfortunate completion of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.



<p>While professor of canon law at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, Hergenr&ouml;ther published several important historico-canonical essays on such subjects as early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reordinations (Ester, Vierteljahrsch. f. kath. Theol., 1862), the canonical relations of the various rites in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (Archiv f. kath. Kirchenrecht, 1862), the politico-ecclesiastical relations of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (ibid., 1863-66), and the canon law of the Greeks to the end of the ninth century (ibid., 1870). His interest in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> vicissitudes of his own day was manifested by valuable essays on the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a> after the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> (Hist.-polit. Bl&#228;tter, 1859), spirit of the age (<em>Zeitgeist</em>) and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sovereignty (Der Katholik, 1861), and the Franco-Sardinian Treaty (Frankfort, 1865). Among his historico-apologetic essays we may count his treatises on the modern <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> condemned by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> (Syllabus) of 8 Dec., 1864 (in the Chilianeum, 1865), the veneration of the Blessed Virgin in the first ten centuries of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a> (M&uuml;nster, 1870). He was a regular contributor of similar but briefer articles to the <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> periodicals, "Die katholische Wochenschrift" and the "Chilianeum". Hergenr&ouml;ther was constantly engaged in attempting to develop a genuine <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sentiment and truly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life among the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. He preached frequently, and was always a welcome speaker at the general assemblies of the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> associations (<em>Vereine;</em> 1863-77). For the <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> meeting of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (1870) he prepared an exhaustive historical study on the spoliation of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, in which he developed at length the arguments for the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>.

<p>Together with other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and insight, Hergenr&ouml;ther deplored the attitude that certain <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> assumed from about 1860, in particular that of the celebrated historian <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>. The latter's work "Kirche und Kirchen, Papsttum und Kirchenstaat" (1861) was criticized by Hergenr&ouml;ther in "Der Katholik". At the <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> meeting of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> savants (1863), Hergenr&ouml;ther was one of the eight who sent in a written protest against the opening discourse of <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> on the past and present of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. Among the other signers were Heinrich Moufang von Sch&#228;zler, Haffner, Philipps, <a href="../cathen/07307a.htm">Hettinger</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13525b.htm">Scheeben</a>. Hergenr&ouml;ther was soon called on to answer the pamphlet of Dr. Michelis, "Kirche oder Partei? Ein offenes u. freies Wort an den deutschen Episkopat" (Church or Faction? A Frank Address to the German Episcopate), in which this writer attacked <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> the "Mainz" and the "Roman" <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. Hergenr&ouml;ther's answer appeared in the "Chilianeum" (1865) under the title of "Kirche u. nicht Partei. Eine Antwort auf die j&uuml;ngste Brosch&uuml;re des Herrn Dr. Fr. Michelis" (Church and not Faction: an Answer to the latest Brochure of Dr. Michelis). In the same review (1863) Hergenr&ouml;ther had written a critical account of the latest efforts of Western <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reunion with the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a>.

<p>The opening of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> (1870) brought to a head the domestic conflict in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Hergenr&ouml;ther was the foremost defender of the council and its decrees; as early as 1868 he had been appointed, with <a href="../cathen/07307a.htm">Hettinger</a>, consultor for the preparation of the council's work and had taken up his residence at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His inexhaustible <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, canon law, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> made him a valuable co-labourer in the many careful and detailed preliminary meetings of the council commission. In the meantime he prepared, with <a href="../cathen/07307a.htm">Hettinger</a>, and published in the "Chilianeum" (1869) a memorial of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> in reply to five questions, submitted by the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Government, concerning the approaching council. He also published (Der Katholik, 1871) another outlined memorial concerning the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, in reply to eleven questions submitted by the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Minister of Worship to the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and law faculties of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>. This memorial, though projected, was never formally called for by the Government. The opposition to the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> reached its acme in the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> work, "Der Papst und das Concil", by "Janus" (<a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>). In the same year (1869) Hergenr&ouml;ther prepared his "Anti-Janus", an historico-theological critique (Freiburg, 1870). He also published a number of small brochures in favour of the council and against <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, e.g. "Die Irrth&uuml;mer logischer Censor" (Freiburg, 1870), and a critique of <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">Dr. D&ouml;llinger's</a> declaration of 28 March, 1871 (Freiburg, 1871). His pen was also active in the "Historisch-politische Bl&#228;tter", where he published (1870) a series of articles on the "Allgemeine Zeitung" and its letters from the council, on <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> before the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, and on ancient Gallicans and modern Appellants. In 1871 he published the solid study "Das unfehlbare Lehrant des Papstes" [The Infallible Magisterium (teaching office) of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a>, 1871]. These grave and exhausting labours were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> and partially summarized by a new work, "Katholische Kirche u. christlicher Staat in ihrer geschichtlichen Entwicklung u. in Beziehung auf die Gegenwart" (The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the Christian State, in their historical development and their relations to the present), together with an "Anti-Janus vindicatus" (Freiburg, 1872, 2nd annotated ed., Freiburg, 1876). The former is a <em>thesaurus</em> of information concerning politico-ecclesiastical conflicts of the past, and is marked throughout by an uncompromising <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> tone. It was translated into Italian (Pavia, 1877) and into English (London, 1876; Baltimore, 1889).

<p>The friends and disciples of Hergenr&ouml;ther had often urged him to compose a manual of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, but the labours of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> had left him no time for such a task; moreover, he had been considering an extensive work on <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> in the eighteenth century. He yielded, however, to the general desire, and published his "Handbuch der allgemeinen Kirchengeschichte" (Manual of General Church History) in the "theological Library" of <a href="../cathen/07251c.htm">Herder</a> (Freiburg, 1876). A second annotated edition appeared in 1879; in 1880 a third volume was added, containing the notes and documentary evidence. This work was then and remains yet unsurpassed for abundance of information, accuracy of narrative, and manifold sources of historical <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. A third edition appeared (1884-86), in which the notes are no longer printed apart, but accompany the text. The writer of this article is the editor of a fourth edition (3 vols., Freiburg, 1902-1909). When it was proposed to bring out a new edition of the "Kirchenlexikon" of <a href="../cathen/15607b.htm">Wetzer</a> and <a href="../cathen/15587a.htm">Welte</a>, Hergenr&ouml;ther was naturally suggested as the savant most capable of executing this gigantic task. He accepted it, but was compelled to abandon it when scarcely begun; his elevation to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> with the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of a Roman residence, left him no freedom for the enterprise. The first volume contains many articles from his pen, some of them quite lengthy. He was unable to do as much for the other volumes&mdash;in all there are eighty-seven articles signed by him. Other minor literary tasks consumed his spare hours in the last period of his life at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>. The various subjects were <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> (W&uuml;rzburg, 1876); <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> the Great (Cologne, 1876); Cardinal Maury in "Katholische Studien" (W&uuml;rzburg, 1878); a short history of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> (W&uuml;rzburg, 1878); the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty among the Oriental <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in "Archiv f. kath. Kirchenrecht" (1877); the canonical significance of <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> (ibid., 1878). Hergenr&ouml;ther's solid and important works in the departments of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> and canon law, and his firm attitude on the great <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> questions of the day, won for him the confidence of all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scholars of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In 1877 <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> had recognized his services to the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> by making him a domestic <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>. When <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> determined to open the Vatican Archives to the scholars of the world, he found in him the savant to whom he might safely entrust the practical execution of this generous act. Hergenr&ouml;ther was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal-Deacon</a> of San Nicol&#242; in Carcere, 12 May, 1879, to the great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of all German, and particularly <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. At a later date he was transferred to Santa Maria in Via Lata. He was also appointed Cardinal-Prefect of the Apostolic Archives, a new office, which he was the first to fill, and in which he was charged with the establishment of research work in the Vatican Archives and the systematizing, on scientific lines, of scholarly work amid these rich treasures. That he executed the views of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in a satisfactory and even generous manner, is acknowledged by the numerous historical workers who have laboured in the archives since 1879. Hergenr&ouml;ther was also a member of several <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman congregations</a> (Index, Studies, and Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs), and protector of several religious institutes. He undertook, moreover, to edit the official correspondence (Regesta) of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, a rather thankless task, and one of great difficulty, because of the exceedingly bad handwriting of that day. He was efficiently aided by his younger brother, Franz Hergenr&ouml;ther, who had accompanied him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Before his death the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> published eight parts or <em>fasciculi</em> of this extensive work, "Leonis X Pont. Maximi Regesta", Vol. I (Freiburg, 1884-85). A small part of the second volume was brought out (Freiburg, 1891) by his brother and fellow-editor, since which time the publication has ceased by reason of the latter's return to <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> as canon capitular of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.

<p>Despite the grave burdens that now weighed upon him, Cardinal Hergenr&ouml;ther undertook another work of the most exacting nature, the continuation of Hefele's "History of the Councils", two volumes of which he published before his death (vol. VIII, Freiburg, 1887; vol. IX, 1890). The latter volume contains the preliminary history of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> and is also a history of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Lutheran Reformation</a>. He suffered much in the last years of his life, as the result of an apoplectic attack which crippled him grievously though it did not affect the brightness and vigour of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. He was able to keep up his literary labours to the day of his death. During the summer vacation of 1880 he took up his residence in the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey of Mehrerau (on the Bodensee) the hospitality of which he had more than once enjoyed. In this secluded spot he met with another apoplectic stroke, and died. He was laid to rest in the church of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. In 1897 a suitable monument was erected to his memory by his friends, and dedicated (25 March).
