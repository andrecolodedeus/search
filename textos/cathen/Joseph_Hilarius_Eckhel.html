<h1>Joseph Hilarius Eckhel</h1>  

<p>German <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatist</a>, b. 13 January, 1737, at Enzesfeld near Pottenstein, in Lower <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, where his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, Johann Anton Eckhel, was steward to the Prince of Montecuculi; d. 16 May, 1798. In 1745 he was sent to study in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, in 1751 was admitted into the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and thirteen years later was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He had studied humanities in Leoben and philosophy in Graz, besides mathematics, Greek, and Hebrew. The first fruit of his literary labours, produced in his twenty-first year, was an "Exercitium grammaticum in prophetiam Obadi&aelig;". This he published as an appendix to the "Institutiones lingu&aelig; sacr&aelig;" of P.J. Engstler. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, and probably for some time before, he was professor at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> gymnasia at Leoben and Steyer; probably also at Judenburg, and finally at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where he taught poetry and rhetoric, and acquired a mastery of Latin, which he handled with ease and elegance. We still possess two rather comprehensive odes from his pen, "Plausus Urbis" and "Plausus Ruris". He left, besides, two German poems written for special occasions, in the style of that period, and a speech of the same nature delivered on the occasion of the journey of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a> to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.

<p>How he became a <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatist</a>, Eckhel himself has told us in the preface to his "Numi veteres anecdoti". Whilst teaching at the Academic Gymnasium he became interested in its cabinet of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, which was under the supervision of his fellow <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, P. Khell. The collection, containing principally Greek <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, had attained considerable size, through the exertions of the learned <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> Fr&ouml;hlich, who had edited a catalogue of most of the ancient <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>; Eckhel set to work selecting the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> which were as yet unknown and unedited, and added thereto the unedited <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of the choice collections of Count Michael Viczay and Paul Festetics. Forced by ill-health to abandon teaching, he devoted himself entirely to <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatics</a> and arch&aelig;ology. With the permission of his superior he went to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 1772 for his further <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. In Bologna and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he studied all the accessible coin collections, but found his richest treasures in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>. Raimundo Cocchi, prefect of the Archducal Museum, received him most cordially and obtained for him the commission to arrange the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> which had been collected by Cardinal Leopoldo de'Medici, and which had afterwards been very considerably increased. Cocchi, who died shortly after this, recommended Eckhel to the Archduke Peter Leopold, who in turn introduced him to his mother, the <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Empress Maria Theresa</a>. Meanwhile (1773) the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> was suppressed, and Eckhel, like his brethren, was secularized. Returning to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> through the South of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in January, 1774, he was delighted to be entrusted by the empress with the task of transferring the collection which belonged to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> college of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, to the court cabinet, where, however, it received a separate place. In March of the same year, having acquired an excellent reputation as a <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatist</a>, he was named director of the cabinet of ancient <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, with Duval as his superior. After the latter's death (1775) he received sole charge. Eckhel was commissioned to deliver bi-weekly lectures on <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatics</a> in the coin cabinet. In the fall of 1775 he was promoted to the chair of antiquities and of the historical auxiliary <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In the same year his first <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatic</a> publication appeared.

<p>J. von Bergmann writes of Eckhel's official work: "Eckhel, as is everywhere evident, was an expert administrator of the treasure committed to his charge. Without much ado, without ostentation, he wrote only what was needful and regarded merely that which was essential. Besides his very simple accounts and some reports written during the twenty-four years of his incumbency, only a very few documents concerning the collection of antique <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> are in existence. He enriched the cabinet without advertising it." He obtained the means for these acquisitions from the proceeds of the sale of duplicates of gold and silver <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>. The duplication of examples resulted from the amalgamation of the collection of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> with that of the imperial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Moreover, the series of the Persian and Parthian kings were transferred from the Oriental to the ancient department. The collection of Duke Charles of Lorraine, that of the Count of Ariosti, and a selection of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> from the collections of suppressed <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were added. By means of embassies and lucky finds the coin cabinet acquired important additions (e.g. those of Osztropataka and Szilagy-Somlyo). As a professor in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> Eckhel lectured on ancient <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatics</a>. His delivery is described as being simple, clear, instructive, inspiring, and often abounding in humour. He was highly respected by his pupils. That he also enjoyed high repute among his colleagues is attested by his appointment as dean of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculty in 1789. However, he soon resigned this position.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatic</a> work published by Eckhel was "Numi veteres anecdoti ex museis C&aelig;sareo Vindobonensi, Florentino Magni Ducis Etruri&aelig;, Granelliano nunc C&aelig;sareo, Vitzaiano, Festeticsiano, Savorgnano Veneto aliisque" (Vienna, 1775, in two 4to sections with 17 copperplates). "Catalogus Musei C&aelig;sariensis" (Vienna, in two large folio parts with numerous illustrations) followed four years later. Eckhel had given the collection entrusted to him an entirely new arrangement, discarding the time-honoured alphabetical order, and substituting quite a new system. He divided ancient <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatics</a> into two departments: the first contained the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> minted by cities other than <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, arranged according to the geographical situation of the countries as far as this was possible; the second comprised all the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of the Roman Empire. First come the important but crude <em>asses</em>, then the unclassified pieces with the inscription <em>Roma</em>. They are followed by those of the various <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, emperors, and empresses, all arranged as far as possible in chronological order. Those whose date could not be exactly obtained are placed after each emperor as unclassified in alphabetical succession. "By this method", says Eckhel, "the author was enabled to rectify countless <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> which Mezzabarba had forced upon us in his General Catalogue" (Imperatorum Romanorum numismata, Milan, 1683). And to make these corrections principally led him to prepare this catalogue for print. In it he gives an account, not on outside authority, but from personal observation and after lengthy and painstaking research, of everything instructive which so numerous a collection presents. The work was written in Latin and, "contrary to the present ornamental style, in the simplest language". This catalogue was followed by "Sylloge II, numorum veterum anecdotorum Thesauri C&aelig;sarei" and "Descriptio numorum Antiochi&aelig;" (1786), then by the classical work "Doctrina numorum veterum", in eight volumes (1792-1798). Friedrich Kenner says of this: "Misguided dilettantism had produced most mischievous results in the field of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatics</a>. Lack of system, want of critical judgment, and the disorderly arrangement of the literature had begotten confusion and distrust, which prevented <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatics</a> from taking the place among other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> to which it was entitled. With his naturally critical eye, Eckhel mastered all the literature of his subject, eliminated <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and forgeries with the help of his profound learning, and then combined the results into an organic whole in his 'Doctrina numorum veterum'. . . . Eckhel has become the founder of the scientific <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatics</a> of classical antiquity and taken his place alongside of his contemporaries, Heyne and <a href="../cathen/15650a.htm">Winckelmann</a>. <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">Numismatics</a>, hitherto despised, he changed into a kind of encyclopedia of classical antiquities, which includes extensive and much-used sources for other branches of arch&aelig;ology." The addenda to this work which Eckhel entered in his <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> copy were edited by his successor, Steinb&uuml;chel.

<p>By command of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a>, Eckhel wrote an excellent manual, "Kurzgefasste Anfangsgr&uuml;nde zur alten Numismatik" (Vienna, 1787; 2nd ed., 1807). The work appeared in a Latin translation in 1799 and in a French revision in 1825. He edited, besides, "Choix des pierres grav&eacute;es du Cabinet Imperial". Furthermore, a number of smaller treatises still exist in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> form. His "Inscriptiones veteres" was used by Theodore Mommsen. He also left an extensive correspondence with the most prominent representatives of his branch of learning (Abb&eacute; Barth&eacute;lemy, R. Cocchi, Cousin&eacute;ry, L. <a href="../cathen/08793c.htm">Lanzi</a>, G. Marini, F. S&eacute;guier, and others).

<p>Eckhel died shortly after the completion of his "Doctrina". He was, as Bergmann writes, "a man of firm and decided character, serious, but at the same time cheerful, indulging in sarcastic, and at times heated, attacks on cant and literary arrogance. He used his extensive learning to correct thousands of blunders committed by other writers, and was modest and not at all disputatious in his controversies. He spoke as he thought and acted as he spoke." Later scholars rank Eckhel's scientific importance equally high. On the first centenary of his birth a medal was struck (by Manfredini) with the inscription, <font size=-2>SYSTEMATIS. REI. NVMARI&AElig;. ANTIQV&AElig;. CONDITORI.</font> The distich which Michael Denis dedicated to his dead friend will vindicate its own <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>:--
