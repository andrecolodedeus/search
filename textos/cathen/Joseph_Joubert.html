<h1>Joseph Joubert</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>; b. at Martignac (Dordogne), 7 May, 1754, d. at Villeneuve-le-Roi (Yonne), 4 May 1824. At the age of fourteen, having finished his studies in his native town, he was sent to <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> to study <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but after a few months joined the Doctrinaires, a teaching order, and was entrusted with the instruction of lower classes. In 1778 he left the order and went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he associated with the most famous literary men of the time, Marmontel, Diderot, and d'Alembert, with whose sentiments he was for some time in sympathy. The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> opened his eyes and made him a strong opponent of the doctrines of the eighteenth century. In 1790 he was elected by his countrymen <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the peace of the canton of Martignac. When his biennial term expired, he refused to accept re-election and returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where in the following year (8 June, 1793) he married Mlle Moreau. Disgusted with the tyranny of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolutionists</a>, he retired to Villeneuve-le-Roi. Even after the 9th of Thermidor he preferred to live there rather than in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. <a href="../cathen/03640a.htm">Chateaubriand</a>, Mme de Beaumont, Fontanes, Mol&eacute;, and Ch&ecirc;nedoll&eacute; were his frequent visitors. In 1809 he was appointed by Fontanes Inspector General of the University of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and in spite of his poor health fulfilled his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> with the greatest <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. When he was compelled to give up his inspectorship, he devoted his time to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of his son and to his literary works. He was one of the first to understand the movement of the Romanticists and to encourage it. Owing to his kind disposition and his delicate taste, as well as his friendly and cheerful character, he had a strong influence over the young men gathered around him. Aiming at what was perfect in literature, he wrote very little and never published anything. He spent his leisure in thinking, and putting down his thoughts for himself. His aim was to note in terse and clear sentences the necessity, utility, and beauty of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. After his death, all these <em>papiers de la malle</em> (scraps of paper), as he called them, aroused the interest and admiration of <a href="../cathen/03640a.htm">Chateaubriand</a>, who published a short selection of them for private circulation, under the title of "Recueil des Pens&eacute;es de M. Joubert" (Paris, 1838). This book was re-edited with many additions by Paul Raynal, a nephew of the author, under the new title of "Pens&eacute;es, Essais, Maximes et Correspondanee de J. Joubert" (Paris, 1842). Many other editions have since been published.
