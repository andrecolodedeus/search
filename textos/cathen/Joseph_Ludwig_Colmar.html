<h1>Joseph Ludwig Colmar</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; born at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, 22 June, 1760; died at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, 15 Dec., 1818. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> (20 Dec., 1783) he was professor of history and Greek at the Royal Seminary, and <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> at St. Stephen's, Strasburg. During the reign of terror, brought about at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, Eulogius Schneider, he secretly remained in the city, and under various disguises administered the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. After the fall of Robespierre he went about preaching and instructing, and worked so successfully for the restoration of religion in the city of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> that <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 24 August, 1802. The <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> had been vacant for ten years; the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> had been profaned and partially destroyed in 1793; a new diocese had been formed under the old title of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, but subject to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>; revolution, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and secularization of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the former archdiocese had ruined his new diocese spiritually and financially. Colmar worked like a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> apostle; he rebuilt and reconsecrated the profaned <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and by his influence saved the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a> which was about to be destroyed by order of the Government. After many difficulties he opened a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> (1804), which he placed under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/09223a.htm">Venerable Libermann</a>; he visited every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and reorganized the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> services, confraternities, devotions, and processions, which the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> had swept away. His principal aim was to organize a system of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction, to inspire his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a>, and to guard them against the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> enlightenment of that age. He was an active adversary of <a href="../cathen/15590b.htm">Wessenberg</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> liberal tendencies represented by him and the <a href="../cathen/07661b.htm">Illuminati</a>. He tried to reintroduce several <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but accomplished, however, only the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/08054a.htm">Institute of Mary Ward (<em>Dames Anglaises</em>)</a>. Shortly before his death he established the sisters of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> part of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (the former <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Diocese of Speyer</a>). During the epidemic of 1813 and 1814, after the battle of Leipzig, he personally served the sick and dying. Colmar edited a collection of old German church <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> (1807) and several excellent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> books. His sermons were published in seven volumes (Mainz, 1836; Ratisbon, 1879).
