<h1>Joseph M. Finotti</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara, Italy</a>, 21 September, 1817; died at Central City, <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a>, 10 January, 1879.

<p>In 1833 the young Finotti was received into the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and for several years taught and studied in the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> of the order in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He was one of the recruits whom Fr. Ryder, in 1845, brought from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to labour in the Maryland Province. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a>, D.C., Fr. Finotti was appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Mary's Church, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, and given charge of outlying missions in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and Virginia. In 1852 he left the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> and went to <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>. For many years he held the position of literary editor of "The Pilot", while acting as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Brookline and later of Arlington, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>.

<p>The last few years of his life he spent in the West, becoming, in 1877, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Central City, <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Colorado</a>, and retaining charge of that <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> up to the time of his death.

<p>Fr. Finotti was a great book lover, giving much time to literary pursuits and displaying special interest in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literary history of America. Among his literary productions are, "Month of Mary", 1853, which reached a sale of 50,000 copies; "Life of Blessed Paul of the Cross", 1860; "Diary of a Soldier", 1861; "The French Zouave", 1863; "Herman the Pianist", 1863; "Works of the Rev. Arthur O'Leary"; "Life of Blessed Peter Claver", etc. Most of these publications were translated or edited by him.

<p>His best-known work, never completed, is his "Bibliographica Catholica Americana" which took years of study and care. It was intended to be a catalogue of all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> books published in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> with notices of their authors, and epitomes of their contents. The first part, which brings the list down to 1820 inclusive, was published in 1872; the second volume, which was to include the works of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers from 1821 to 1875, was never finished, though much of the material for it had been industriously gathered from all available sources.

<p>His last literary effort, which he did not live to see published, entitled "The Mystery of Wizard Clip" (Baltimore, 1879), is a story of preternatural occurrences at Smithfield, <a href="../cathen/15605a.htm">West Virginia</a>, which is partly told in the life of <a href="../cathen/06367b.htm">Father Gilitzin</a>.
