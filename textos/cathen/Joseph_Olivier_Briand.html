<h1>Joseph Olivier Briand</h1>  

<p>Seventh <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12593c.htm">Quebec</a>, b. in 1715 at Pl&eacute;rin, Brittany; d. 25 June, 1794. He studied at the Seminary of <a href="../cathen/02784a.htm">St. Brieuc</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1739, but left home secretly to follow Bishop Pontbriand to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Briand was a strenuous worker, self-possessed, tactful, and devoted. During the siege of Quebec (1759), he, as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, directed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> affairs in the absence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He ministered to the dying at the battle of St. Foy (1760), and after the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> death was appointed administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> which then included Acadia, <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, and Illinois. During the crisis in <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>, when many colonists abandoned the country, Briand foresaw that a change of allegiance was inevitable, and realized the benefit which would accrue to the people of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>.

<p>When the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1763) was signed he ordered a <a href="../cathen/14468c.htm">Te Deum</a> for the cessation of the Seven Years' War and praised General Murray for his humanity towards the conquered. In the midst of the fanaticism which attempted to violate the treaty and hamper religious freedom, Briand appealed to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> to maintain the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The British Crown finally gave ear to his demand, and he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1766).

<p>Hailed as the second founder of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, Briand was joyfully received by the people and the British governor. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> also expressed his pleasure and approved Bishop Briand's past attitude, thereby removing the charges that he had acted with timidity towards Murray and Dorchester (see <a href="../cathen/02743a.htm">Brasseur</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752b.htm">Faillon</a>). Despite his poverty, he declined a gift of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and a plan for his support, and took up his residence at the Seminary of Quebec. Briand's purpose in reconciling the claims of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> was to insure the permanence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>. He demanded two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> simultaneously, so that the survivor, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> permitting, might <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> his successor. This request was finally granted. Through his influence and tact, further plans for perverting the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were thwarted. The Test Oath was modified so as to be acceptable to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and the passage of the Quebec Act (1774), admitting <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to public functions and confirming religious freedom, and of the Habeas Corpus Act, granting <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges of British subjects, was also partly due to Briand's efforts.

<p>After the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> from <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> and Illinois, Bishop Briand appointed Father Meurin <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> in the latter section of the country. When the forces of the Continental army invaded <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1775, he issued a pastoral letter in which he enjoined fidelity to the king. The Continental Congress in an address to the king and people of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> had protested against the Quebec Act, while in its appeal to the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> there were no features which were objectionable to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Briand denounced this duplicity and drew attention to the actions of the Colonists twenty years previous both in their cruelty towards the Acadians and their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against missionaries. Upon Montgomery's defeat he ordered a <a href="../cathen/14468c.htm">Te Deum</a>, and in 1776 he issued another energetic letter in which he urged to repentance those <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> who had aided the invading troops, whom he characterized as enemies of the Faith. This, together with the drastic measure of refusing the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to all <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> sympathizers with the Colonial cause, preserved <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> to the British Crown. Later, Briand, who was invited by Cardinal Castelli, the Prefect of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, to administer confirmation in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, abandoned the plan upon the protest of <a href="../cathen/14285b.htm">Father Ferdinand Steinmeyer, S.J.</a>* (popularly known as Father Farmer), who drew attention to the Anti-Catholic feeling which was then prevalent in the Colonies.

<p>In 1765, Briand published a "Catechism", the first book printed in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. He resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1784, and was the consecrator of his two successors: the Rt. Rev. Louis Philippe Marianchau d'Esglis, 29 Nov. 1784, who died 4 June, 1788; and the Rt. Rev Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Hubert, 19 Nov., 1786. Briand died after fifty-five years in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and twenty-eight in the episcopate.
