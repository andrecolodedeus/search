<h1>Joseph Sibbel</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">Sculptor</a>, b. at Dulmen, 7 June, 1850; d. in New York, 10 July, 1907. As a boy he evinced the inclination for cutting ornaments and figures from wood, which attracted the attention of his teacher, who urged the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of the boy to send him to Munster, <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>. At the establishment of the wood carver, Friedrich A. Ewertz, Sibbel developed a genius for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>. He spent his leisure time in visiting the studio of the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> <a href="../cathen/01104b.htm">Achterman</a>, where he acquired the art of modeling in clay. In 1873 he <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. Here he joined several other artists from the same workshop, who had established an atelier for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, mostly in wood. When this enterprise failed, he tried his hand at secular <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> with a certain Rebisso. When this establishment also failed, Sibbel came to New York, where he established the studio from which issued his many works. Here the difficult task confronted him of competing with the mechanical manufacture of pseudo-art with which the churches were being filled, and which gave them a stereotyped and monotonous decoration. To emulate foreign <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> decoration was his aim. His first work in New York was a lectern, cast in bronze, for the Episcopal Stewart Memorial Cathedral in Garden City, Long Island. Here the young artist broke loose from the ordinary form by placing religious groups in front of the stand. Below the customary eagle with spread wings he designed an upright figure of the Saviour blessing a group at His feet. The sermon desk proper he adorned with a symbolical group of three figures, typifying youth, maturity, and age, listening to the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from above.

<p>It was not until he furnished for the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford</a>, <a href="../cathen/04253b.htm">Connecticut</a>, a series of alto-relievos, prominent among which was an altar picture representing the Child Christ disputing with the Scribes in the temple, that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches began to appreciate him. These and a series of Stations of the Cross were cast in imitation alabaster, and attracted great attention. Still more admirable was his colossal <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Archbishop Feehan of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>. His works showed complete emancipation from the conventionality of the cloister-art of modern times. His best-known work is the heroic and delicately wrought <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York. Here also are to be found his <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of St. Anselmo, <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard of Clairvaux</a>, <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>.

<p>The two heroic panels, representing "Our Lady Comforter of the Afflicted" and "The Death of St. Joseph", erected in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> at St. Louis, are of unique conception. These groups, each twelve feet high and eight feet wide, were carved from one block weighing nearly nine tons. The four heroic <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> at St. Joseph's Seminary, Dunwoodie, New York, must be classed as the final step in his emancipation from conventionality. These figures represent <a href="../cathen/08420b.htm">Father Jogues, S.J.</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> apostle of the Mohawk Indians; <a href="../cathen/13192c.htm">St. Rose of Lima</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> saint of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>; St. Turibius; and Catherine Tagawitha, the Indian maiden, and first convert of the Indian race. In these <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> the artist ventured on a new path in religious <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, portraying typical American subjects. Among his latest works was the exterior and interior statuary decoration of St. Paul's Cathedral in <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburgh</a>. Among these <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> are represented the Apostles and <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctors of the Church</a>, executed in Indian lime-stone. In the conception of each <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> there is expressed a new <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. Most noteworthy is the marble-statue representing <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>. Here the artist represents in two figures a very complex <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. Out of the flames of torture there rises a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> figure, symbolical of a liberated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> casting off the veil of darkness and beholding the light of eternal reward. Below, there appears a still afflicted <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, represented by a wan male figure imploring intercession. Characteristic of Sibbel's works is the pleasing tendency toward freedom from conventionality. They evince originality of design, though still in accord with history and tradition. His <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> are pervaded by a pleasing realistic spirit, which gives to the dull and lifeless marble a form that appeals to the heart and inspires devotion and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.
