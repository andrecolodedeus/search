<h1>Joseph Spillmann</h1>  

<p>Author, b. at Zug, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, 22 April, 1842; d. at <a href="../cathen/09465a.htm">Luxembourg</a>, 20 February, 1905. He attended the primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and <em>gymnasium</em> of his native town, but feeble health necessitated his leaving his studies and devoting himself to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> business. At the age of sixteen he resumed his interrupted studies at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Feldkirch. Having entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Gorheim (1862), he was sent, during the Franco-Prussian War (1870), to nurse the sick. Ten years later, when his order was banished from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, he went to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to complete his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies, and in 1874 was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The life work of Spillmann, who had already shown his poetic <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gift</a> in his contributions to "Der Hausfreund" (a calendar published by <a href="../cathen/11382a.htm">Father Pachtler</a> in 1872), was clearly marked out for him. He was appointed collaborator on the "Stimmen aus Maria-Laach" (founded in 1871) and the "Katholiche Missionen" (founded in 1873).

<p>Spillmann's fruitful literary activity resulted chiefly from his connection with these periodicals, especially the "Katholiche Missionen" which he edited from 1880 to 1890. From his "Beilagen f&uuml;r die Jugend" grew seventy portly volumes of the "Reisebilder", while twenty-one booklets, "aus fernen Landern" owe their origin to the same source; those consisted of edifying and tastefully illustrated stories for the young, with whom they have become favorites, which the numerous editions and translations prove. His comprehensive "Geschichte der Katholikenverfolgung in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> von 1535-1681" began with articles in the "Stimmen aus Maria-Laach", was continued in the supplements to this periodical, and was completed in five large volumes. For the calendar, the "Hausfreund", which was given up in 1881, Spellman wrote many stories; these were afterwards collected under the title, "Wolken und Sonnenschein, eight pretty stories for the young which have been frequently republished and translated into other languages. Spillmann also wrote seven longer romances, the first (Die Wonderblum von Woxindon) appearing in 1893; and the last (De schwarze Schumacher) ten years later; they are written in the style of his favorite authors, Sir Walter Scott and Charles Dickens. An eighth romance was sketched, but a serious illness prevented its completion. Spillmann's importance arises chiefly from his works for the young.
