<h1>Joseph Tieffentaller</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary and noted geographer in Hindustan, b. at Bozen in the Tyrol, 27 August, 1710; d. at Lucknow, 5 July, 1785. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> 9 October, 1729, and went in 1740 to the East Indian mission where he occupied various positions, chiefly in the empire of the Great Mogul. After the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society</a> he remained in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and on his death was buried in the mission cemetery at <a href="../cathen/01225a.htm">Agra</a>, where his tombstone still stands. He was a fine scholar with an unusual talent for languages; besides his native tongue he understood Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Hindustan, Arabic, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a>, and Sanscrit. He was the first <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> who wrote an exact description of Hindustan. A brief list of his works is the best <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his extraordinary power of work and his varied scholarship.

<p>In geography, he wrote a "Descriptio Indi&aelig;", that is a circumstantial description of the twenty-two provinces of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, of its cities, fortresses, and the most important smaller towns, together with an exact statement of geographical positions, calculated by means of a simple quadrant. The work also contains a large numbers of maps, plans, and sketches drawn by himself, and the list of geographical positions fills twenty-one quarto pages. He also prepared a large book of maps on the basin of the Ganges, entitled: "Cursus Gang&aelig; fluvi Indi&aelig; maximi, inde Priaga seu Elahbado Calcuttam usque ope acus magnetic&aelig; exploratus atque litteris mandatus a J. T. S.J." (1765). the original map of the lower course of the river measures 15', that of the middle course, from benares to Patna, measures 4' 3" square. In addition there is a map of similar dimensions of the Gagra, the whole accompanied by numerous notes, sketches of particular parts, and maps giving details &mdash; an "enormous labour" as Bernoulli calls it. he also wrote a work on the regions containing the sources of the chief rivers of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. In the field of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> he wrote a <a href="../cathen/02730a.htm">Brahmanism</a> a work directed against the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the Englishmen Z. Howell and Alexander Dow. Others of his writings were on Indian <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, Indian asceticism, the religion of the Parsees, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>, the relation of these <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> to one another, etc. His writings in the department of the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> are: <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> observations on the sunspots and zodiacal light, studies on the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04413a.htm">cosmology</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>, descriptions and observation's of the flora and fauna of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. the department of history is represented by writings in Latin on the origin of the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a> and of their religion, an account in German of the expeditions of Nadir Shah to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, the deeds of the Great Mogul Shah Alam in Persian, and in French in incursions of the Afghans and the conquest of Delhi, and the contemporary history of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, 1757-64. In linguistics he wrote a Sanscrit-Parsee lexicon, treatises in Latin on the language of the Parsees, on the proper pronunciation of Latin, etc.

<p>Tieffentaller sent these works in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> partly to the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> scholar Dr. Kratzenstein in Copenhagen, partly to the celebrated French orientalist and geographer A. H. Anquetil-Duperron (1731-1805). The latter gave due credit to the value and importance of the works, especially those on geography, in his address before the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a> of Sciences ("Journal des Scavans", Dec., 1776), and made the writing of Tieffentaller partly accessible to the learned world in his "Recherches hist. et g&eacute;ogr. sur l'Inde" (1786), and also in his "Carte g&eacute;n&eacute;ral du cours du Gange et du Gagra dress&eacute;e par les cartes particuli&eacute;res du P. Tieffenthaler (Paris, 1784). A part of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> at <a href="../cathen/04352a.htm">Copenhagen</a> were obtained by the German scholar Johann Bernoulli of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> who used them in connection with the "Recherches" of Anquetil for the great work "Des Pater Joseph Tieffenthalers d. Ges. Jesu. und apost. Missionarius in Indien historisch-geographische Beschreibung von Hindustan . . ." (3 vols., quarto, Berlin-Gotha, 1785-87). the greater part of the first two volumes is devoted to Tieffentaller's writings, his maps, and sketches. the French edition, entitled "Description hist. et g&eacute;ogr. de l'Inde . . ." appeared at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> in three vols., 4to (1786-91). a large part of his <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are probably still extant in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Copenhagen.
