<h1>Joseph of Arimathea</h1>  

<p>All that is known for certain concerning him is derived from the <a href="../cathen/03274a.htm">canonical</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. He was born at Arimathea &#151; hence his surname &#151; "a city of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>" (<a href="../bible/luk023.htm#vrs51">Luke 23:51</a>), which is very likely identical with Ramatha, the birthplace of the Prophet Samuel, although several scholars prefer to identify it with the town of Ramleh. He was a wealthy <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelite</a> (<a href="../bible/mat027.htm#vrs57">Matthew 27:57</a>), "a good and a just man" (<a href="../bible/luk023.htm#vrs50">Luke 23:50</a>), "who was also himself looking for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>" (<a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs43">Mark 15:43</a>). He is also called by St. Mark and by St. Luke a <em>bouleutes</em>, literally, "a senator", whereby is meant a member of the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a> or supreme council of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. He was a disciple of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, probably ever since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> first preaching in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> (<a href="../bible/joh002.htm#vrs23">John 2:23</a>), but he did not declare himself as such "for fear of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs38">John 19:38</a>). On account of this secret allegiance to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, he did not consent to His condemnation by the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a> (<a href="../bible/luk023.htm#vrs51">Luke 23:51</a>), and was most likely absent from the meeting which sentenced <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to death (cf. <a href="../bible/mar014.htm#vrs64">Mark 14:64</a>).

<p>The Crucifixion of the Master quickened Joseph's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and suggested to him that he should provide for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> burial before the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> began. Unmindful therefore of all personal danger, a danger which was indeed considerable under the circumstances, he boldly requested from <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and was successful in his request (<a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs43">Mark 15:43-45</a>). Once in possession of this sacred treasure, he &#151; together with Nicodemus, whom his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> had likewise emboldened, and who brought abundant spices &#151; wrapped up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Body in fine linen and grave bands, laid it in his own <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, new and yet unused, and hewn out of a rock in a neighbouring garden, and withdrew after rolling a great stone to the opening of the sepulchre (<a href="../bible/mat027.htm#vrs59">Matthew 27:59, 60</a>; <a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs46">Mark 15:46</a>; <a href="../bible/luk023.htm#vrs53">Luke 23:53</a>; <a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs38">John 19:38-42</a>). Thus was fulfilled Isaiah's prediction that the grave of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> would be with a rich man (<a href="../bible/isa053.htm#vrs9">Isaiah 53:9</a>). The <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> celebrates the feast of Joseph of Arimathea on 31 July, and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> on 17 March. The additional details which are found concerning him in the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> "Acta Pilati", are unworthy of credence. Likewise fabulous is the legend which tells of his coming to Gaul A.D. 63, and thence to Great Britain, where he is supposed to have founded the earliest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratory</a> at <a href="../cathen/06579a.htm">Glastonbury</a>. Finally, the story of the translation of the body of Joseph of Arimathea from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to Moyenmonstre (Diocese of Toul) originated late and is unreliable.
