<h1>Josephites</h1>  

<p>(Sons of St. Joseph)

<p>A congregation devoted to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth, founded in the <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Diocese of Ghent</a> (Belgium) by Canon van Crombrugghe, in 1817. Father van Crombrugghe was at that time a simple village <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> acting as <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> at Heusden, when he made the acquaintance of a young man named van den Bossche, of remarkable talent and great <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Together they conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of forming a body of men, under the patronage of St. Joseph, to work among the poor. Father Crombrugghe drew up a few rules, which were the basis of the future constitutions, and the first community of Josephites opened at Grammont, 1 May, 1817, a house known as <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. This was the year of famine, and the poor suffered great privations, which the Josephites were able to relieve in great measure by giving them employment and teaching them to weave. So many now flocked to their protection that on 2 November they rented a part of the old <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The next year the founder gave a constitution to his religious, and the first Josephites bound themselves by the three customary <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. In 1819 a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for paying students was started next to the free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, but, by order of the Government, the day-school was closed because the congregation was not yet recognized. In 1823, in spite of the proscription, the Josephites for the first time wore their religious habit, but in 1826 were ordered by the Government to close their church, and the following year all religious and <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> admitted since 1823 were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave the community. During the first thirteen years of its existence, between three and four thousand boys had been indebted to it for their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. In 1830, when the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgians</a> threw off the yoke of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and the National Congress placed liberty of instruction in the new constitution, the Josephites began to take an active part in the work of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Bishop van de Velde of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> approved their rules, and Father Ignatius van den Bossche became the first superior general. On all sides the Sons of St. Joseph were in demand for the direction of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and colleges, so that the original object of the institute, which had been the instruction of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, was gradually modified. The house of Grammont remained the mother-house, appointed as such by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. A thorough course of professional studies was organized, in accordance with the official government programme, and later on a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of agriculture was added. This latter obtained such success in numerous exhibitions that it was granted the support and recognition of the State.

<p>Under the generalship of Father Ignatius, many new houses were opened, the two most important being those at Melle and <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. The college of Melle is established in a former <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a>, founded in 1431. These canons had a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at Melle in the seventeenth century, but this was closed by order of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>. After passing through several hands, the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> at length came into the possession of M. van Wymelbeke, the brother-in-law of Father Crombrugghe, and in 1837 was given over to the Josephites. Here they established for the first time a complete course of commercial <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, which course was afterwards adopted in all the higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of commerce. Their museum of commercial products and merchandise has a <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> reputation. By a royal decree of 11 May, 1901, the Higher School of Commerce of Melle was given the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to confer degrees in commercial <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. In 1900 the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Melle founded a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of industries, with a maritime and a colonial section for the benefit of students who do not intend to pursue <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> studies. The new <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a> was opened by the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in 1835, and seven years later, at the request of Cardinal Sterckx, the Josephites established a course of classical and professional studies at Holy Trinity College, founded by the old <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1657. Under the direction of Father Remy de Sadeleer, the congregation made great progress and, on 23 Sept., 1863, obtained a laudatory <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In 1869 the father general sent a few members of the congregation to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where they opened a large college at <a href="../cathen/04541a.htm">Croydon</a>. On 21 Sept. of the same year, Father F&eacute;licien Campe was elected superior general for twelve years and, in accordance with the general desire of the members of the congregation, set to work to obtain from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> for his spiritual sons. Re-elected in 1881, Father Campe, in 1884, bought from Lord Petre a <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of 110 acres, at Weybridge, in the County of Surrey; St. George's College, <a href="../cathen/04541a.htm">Croydon</a>, too small for the ever-increasing number of boys, was sold, and the students transferred to Weybridge.

<p>The congregation was declared <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> in March, 1897, by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, who appointed Cardinal Svampa protector of the institute. The sixth superior general, Father F&eacute;lix de Vlieghe, named in January, 1899, opened at the mother-house a "little novitiate", for the training of boys from the age of fourteen, who feel themselves called to the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. On 9 July, 1901, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> solemnly approved of the institute, and in 1907 Cardinal Merry del Val was named protector of the congregation.
