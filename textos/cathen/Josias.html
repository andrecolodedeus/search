<h1>Josias</h1>  

<p>(J<font size=-2>OSIAH</font>&mdash; Hebrew for "Yahweh supports"; <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> <em>'Ios&#237;as</em>).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> King of Juda (639-608 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), who ascended the throne when he was only eight years of age. He was the son of Amon and the grandson of Manasses. His mother's name is given as Idida, the daughter of Hadaia [IV (II) Kings, xxii, 1]. Of the actual influences under which he grew up nothing is known for <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>. His reign of thirty-one years is recorded in the parallel and slightly divergent accounts of IV (II) Kings, xxii-xxiii, 30, and II Paralipomenon (Chronicles), xxxiv-xxxv. The following is a summary of Josias's public acts as they are set forth in the former of these accounts. In the eighteenth year of his rule, the Jewish king undertook to repair the Temple with the help of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> Helcias. During the course of this work, Helcias found "the Book of the Law", and handed it to the royal scribe, Saphan, who read it to Josias. The threats made therein against the transgression of its contents frightened the monarch, who well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how often these had been disobeyed in the past, and who sent to consult the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophetess</a> Holda then living in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Holda declared that the threatened punishments would indeed take place, but only after Josias's death. Whereupon the king assembled the people, published the Law in their hearing, and they all united with Josias in a solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of obedience to its commands. This was followed by a drastic reformation of worship not only in Juda and in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, but also in Northern Israel, which was not strictly a part of Josias's kingdom, but in which the Jewish prince could easily intervene, owing probably to the feeble hold of <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a> at the time upon this distant portion of its territory. The work of reform was concluded by a magnificent celebration of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a>.

<p>Of the thirteen years of Josias's reign which followed this important reformation, nothing is said in the narrative of the Fourth Book of Kings. We are simply told of the monarch's exceeding <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> towards <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a> and of his death on the battle-field of <a href="../cathen/09526a.htm">Mageddo</a>, where he perished fighting against the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, Nechao II, who was then on his way to the Euphrates against the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>. Whoever compares carefully and impartially with this first account of Josias's reign the second one given in <a href="../bible/2ch034.htm">2 Chronicles 34-35</a>, cannot help being struck with their wonderful substantial agreement. Both Biblical records agree perfectly as to the age of the king at his accession and as to the length of his reign. Like the narrative of Kings, that of Paralipomenon refers to the eighteenth year of Josias's rule the discovery of the "Book of the Law", relates the same circumstances as attending that event, speaks of a work of religious reform as carried out throughout all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> on account of the contents of that book, and praises the magnificence of the solemn <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a> celebrated in harmony with its prescriptions. Like the narrative of Kings, too, that of Paralipomenon appreciates in the most favourable manner the king's character and describes his death on the battle-field of <a href="../cathen/09526a.htm">Mageddo</a> when fighting against Nechao. In view of this it is plain that the differences, noticeable in their respective accounts of the reign of Josias by the authors of <a href="../bible/2ki000.htm">2 Kings</a> and <a href="../bible/2ch000.htm">2 Chronicles</a>, are only slight variations naturally accounted for by the somewhat different purposes which the two inspired. With regard to the exact extent and the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> origin of the "Book of the Law", discovered under Josias, see <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">P<font size=-2>ENTATEUCH</font></a>.
