<h1>Jos&eacute; Celestino Mutis</h1>  

<p>Eminent naturalist and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientist</a> in South America, b. at <a href="../cathen/03131b.htm">Cadiz, Spain</a>, 6 April, 1732; d. at <a href="../cathen/02612a.htm">Bogot&aacute;, Colombia</a>, 2 Sept., 1808.

<p>Mutis studied <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> at Seville and <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> and, from 1757, practised as a physician at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, where he applied himself to botany. Soon afterwards he went to South America as physician-in-ordinary to the newly-appointed Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">New Granada</a>, Mes&iacute;a de la Cerda (Marqu&eacute;s de la Vega). In November, 1760, he landed in Cartagena, and remained in <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">New Granada</a> for five decades. By his great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and his untiring and versatile activity, he became more and more the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of all scientific undertakings in Spanish South America. Although he at first taught mathematics and, about the end of his life, founded an observatory in Bogot&aacute; and directed the same as <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, he devoted his energies almost wholly to researches in the natural history of <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">New Granada</a>, even continuing this work, when, in 1772, he became a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> (<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>?) and canon at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/02612a.htm">Bogot&aacute;</a>. During the first years of his life at <a href="../cathen/02612a.htm">Bogot&aacute;</a> he had planned the botanical exploration of the whole country, intending to write a book on the flora of <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">New Granada</a>. For his researches he maintained substations at C&aacute;cota and La Montuosa, which Linn&eacute; supposed to be situated in Mexico. He settled in Mariquita after he had been appointed in 1783 by Charles III, under the viceroy and Archbishop Gongora, leader of the "Expedici&oacute;n bot&aacute;nica del Nueva Reino de Granad", which was founded by the State. Here, as Alexander von Humboldt, an eyewitness, relates, Mutis laid out a plantation of cinchona. Mutis was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to train his whole staff of assistants (collectors, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, engravers, etc.); he also taught several native botanists, e.g., Zea, Caldas, and Restrepo, furthermore his nephew and successor, Sinforoso Mutis. At that time, Mutis was widely known; Linn&eacute;, who received from him South American plants and corresponded frequently with him, calls him "phytologorum americanorum princeps". Linn&eacute;'s son defined the <em>genus Mutisia</em> in 1781. The Spanish botanist Cavanilles lauded him in 1791 as "botanicorum facile princeps". At Bogot&aacute;, where he spent the last ten years of his life, the famous explorers Humboldt and Bonpland stayed with him for two months in 1801, filled with admiration for his rich collections. Their famous work, "Plantes equinoctiales" (1818), is adorned with a beautiful portrait of Mutis, and Humboldt erected a glorious monument to the American investigator by writing his biography ("Biographie universelle", XXX, Paris, 1821).

<p>Subsequent generations were perhaps justified in judging Mutis less favourably, but it is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> on the part of some critics to seek to degrade Mutis to the position of an unimportant amateur or to abuse him. Mutis committed the fault that he never ended his researches, and thus published almost nothing during his life-time. He, furthermore, had the misfortune to have his scientific legacy at first remain totally unnoticed in consequence of the political disorders of that time. His museum consisted of 24,000 dried plants, 5000 drawings of plants by his pupils, and a collection of woods, shells, resins, minerals, and skins. These treasures arrived safely at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> in 105 boxes, and the plants, <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and drawings were sent to the botanical gardens, where they were buried in a tool-house. Mutis's cinchona investigations render his work of lasting importance. While he was not the first to discover the genuine cinchona for <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">New Granada</a> &mdash; as became known with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> only after his death &mdash; he rendered important services by his study of the cinchonas, their geographical distribution in <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">Colombia</a>, their species and varieties, and their utilization for medicine. This is shown by the trade, which developed in such a manner that (e.g.) the seaport of <a href="../cathen/03384b.htm">Cartagena</a> alone exported from <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">New Granada</a> 1,200,000 pounds of cinchona bark in 1806, while previous to 1776 this country produced no quinquina at all. This is furthermore shown by Mutis's writings, which, however, were not printed in full until 1870. Mutis himself published in 1793 and 1794 a short monograph on cinchonas in "Diaro de Santa Fe de Bogot&aacute;". A year later appeared "Observaciones y conocimientos de la quina" (in 4 numbers, 608-11, of "Mercurio Peruanode Lima", 1795). The above-mentioned Zea published sometime later "Memoria sobre la quina segun los principios del Se&ntilde;or Mutis" ("Anales de Historia Natural", Madrid, 1800). Mutis sent his chief work "El arcano de la quina" in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> prevented its publication; in 1828 the Spanish physician Hern&aacute;ndez de Gregorio edited the first three parts of this work with Mutis's portrait ("El arcano de la quina. Discurso que contiene la parte m&eacute;dica de las cuatro especies de quinas oficinalis", <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 1828, 263 pages). The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the botanical-scientific part was discovered by Clements R. Markham in a shed in the botanical gardens of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>; he published it under the title: "Tabula synoptica ad specierum generis Chinchon&aelig; determinationem. Quinilogi&aelig; pars quarta" (edited in Markham, "The Cinchona species of New Granada", London, 1867). The tables, which Mutis selected for this work, were published in 1870 in facsimile by Triana ("Nouvelles &eacute;tudes sur les Quinquina", <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>). Through these writings it became evident, as some special investigators confessed, that Mutis had penetrated deeply into the study of the cinchonas of Central Colombia. It may be mentioned that Mutis distinguished four species of cinchonas with an officinal bark, and he added to them twenty-four varieties. For other <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of Mutis see Colmeiro; a part of Mutis's correspondence is to be found in the work: "A selection of the correspondence of Linn&aelig;us and other naturalists" (London, 1881).
