<h1>Jos&eacute; Mercado Rizal</h1>  

<p>Filipino hero, physician, poet, novelist, and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>; b. at Calamba, Province of La Laguna, Luzon, 19 June, 1861; d. at <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a>, 30 December, 1896. On his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> side he was descended from Lam-co, who came from <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> to settle in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> in the latter part of the seventeenth century. His mother was of Filipino-Chinese-Spanish origin. Rizal studied at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> of the Ateneo, <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a>, where he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts with highest honours before he had completed his sixteenth year. He continued his studies in Manila for four years and then proceeded to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where he devoted himself to philosophy, literature, and medicine, with ophthalmology as a specialty. In <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> he became a <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemason</a>, and thus became associated with men like Zorilla, Sagasta, Castelar, and Balaguer, prominent in Spanish politics. Here and in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> he began to imbibe the political <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, which later cost him his life. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> he was enrolled as a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> student in the University of Heidelburg and became acquainted with Virchow and Blumentritt. In Berlin was published his novel "Noli me tangere" (1886) characterized, perhaps too extravagantly, by W.D. Howells as "a great novel" written by one "born with a gift so far beyond that of any or all of the authors of our roaring literary successes." Several editions of the work were published in <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. There is a French translation ("Biblioth&#232;que sociologique", num 25, Paris, 1899), and two abbreviated English translations of little value: "An Eagle's Flight" (New York, 1900) and "Friars and Filipinos" (New York, 1902). The book satirizes the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> as well as the Filipinos. Rizal's animosity to the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> was largely of domestic origin. The <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> were the landlords of a large <em>hacienda</em> occupied by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>; there was a vexatious litigation, and a few years later, by Weyler's order, soldiers destroyed the buildings on the land, and various members of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> were exiled to other parts of the Islands.

<p>Rizal returned to the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> in 1887. After a stay of about six months he set out again for <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, passing through <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. In <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> he prepared his annotated edition of Morga's "Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas" which he completed in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1890). In <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> he published (Ghent, 1891; Manila, 1900) "El Filibusterismo", a sequel to "Noli me tangere". Its animus may be judged from its dedication to three Filipino <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who were executed for complicity in the Cavite outbreak of 1872. In 1891 he arrived in Hong Kong, where he practised <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a>. The following year he came to <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a>, but five days before his arrival a case was filed against him for "anti-religious and anti-patriotic propaganda". On 7 July the governor-general ordered Rizal's deportation to Mindanao. The reasons given were the finding in his baggage of leaflets, "satirizing the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> and tending to de-catholicize and so de-nationalize the people"; and the "publication of 'El Filibusterismo' dedicated to the memory of three traitors&mdash;condemned and executed by competent authority&mdash;and whom he hails as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>". Rizal spent four years in peaceful exile in Dapitan, Mindanao, when he volunteered his services to the governor to go to Cuba as a surgeon in the Spanish Army. The offer was accepted. When he arrived in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, he was arrested and brought back to <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a>, where he was charged with founding unlawful associations and promoting rebellion, and sentenced to be shot.

<p>Rizal had given up the practice of his religion long years before. But now he gladly welcomed the ministrations of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, his former professors, and he wrote a retraction of his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and of <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Masonry</a> in particular. On the morning of his execution he assisted at two Masses with great fervour, received <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> and was married to an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> half-caste girl from Hong-King with whom he had cohabited in Dapitan. Almost the last words he spoke were to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> who accompanied him: "My great <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, Father, has brought me here." 30 December, the day of his execution, has been made a national holiday by the American Government and $50,000 appropriated for a monument to his memory; a new province, adjacent to <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a>, is called Rizal; the two centavo postage stamp and two peso bill&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> in most common use&mdash;bear his picture. Whether he was <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> executed or not, is disputed; his plea in his own defense is undoubtedly a strong one (cf. Retata). The year of his death was a year of great uprising in the Islands and feeling ran high. Whatever may be said about his sentence, its fulfillment was a political mistake. Rizal, it is said, did not favour separation from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, nor the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>. Nor did he wish to accomplish his ends&mdash;reforms in the Government&mdash;by revolutionary methods, but by the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of his countrymen and their formation to habits of industry.

<p>Besides the works mentioned above, Rizal wrote a number of poems and essays in Spanish of literacy merit, some translations and short papers in German, French, English, and in his native dialect, Tagalog. A complete list of his writings is given in Retana, "Vida y escritos del Dr. Rizal" (Madrid, 1907).
