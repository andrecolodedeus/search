<h1>Jos&eacute; de Acosta</h1>  

<p>The son of well-to-do and respected <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, born at Medina del Campo in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 1540; died at Salamanca, 15 February, 1600. He became a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at the age of thirteen at the place of his birth. Four of his brothers successively joined the same order. Before leaving <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, he was lecturer in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at Ocana, and in April, 1569, was sent to <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>, <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had been established in the proceeding year. At <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>, Acosta again occupied the chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>; his fame as an orator had proceeded him. In 1571 he went to <a href="../cathen/04580c.htm">Cuzco</a> as a visitor of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> then recently founded. Returning to <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a> three years later, to again fill the chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, he was elected provincial in 1576. He founded a number of colleges, among them those of <a href="../cathen/01701b.htm">Arequipa</a>, Potose, Chuquisaca, <a href="../cathen/11438a.htm">Panama</a>, and La Paz, but met with considerable opposition from the viceroy, Francisco de Toledo. His official <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to investigate personally a very extensive range of territory, so that he acquired a practical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the vast province, and of its aboriginal inhabitants. At the provincial council of 1582, at <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>, Acosta played a very important part. Called to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> by the King in 1585, he was detained in Mexico, where he dedicated himself to studies of the country and people; returning to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, he filled the chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the Roman college in 1594, as well as other important positions. At the time of his death, he was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the college at Salamanca.

<p>Few members of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in the sixteenth century have been so uniformly eulogized as Father Acosta. Independently of his private character, his learning and the philosophic spirit pervading his works attracted the widest attention in learned circles. Translations of his works exist in many languages of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, while the naturalists of the eighteenth century praise his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the flora of western South America. Aside from his publication of the proceedings of the provincial councils of 1567 and 1583, and several works of exclusively <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> import, Acosta is best known as writer through the "De Natura Novi Orbis." "De promulgatione Evangelii apud Barbaros, sive De Procuranda Indorum salute", and above all, the "Historia natural y moral de las Indias." The first two appeared at Salamanca in 1588, the last at Seville in 1590, and was soon after its publication translated into various languages. It is chiefly the "Historia natural y moral" that has established the reputation of Acosta. In a form more concise than that employed by his predecessors, <a href="../cathen/06632a.htm">Gomara</a> and Oviedo, he treats the natural and philosophic history of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> from a broader point of view. Much of what he says is of necessity <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, because it is influenced by the standard of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his time; but his criticisms are remarkable, while always dignified. He reflects the scientific <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the period in which he lived, but with hints of a more advanced understanding. As far as the work of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> among the Indians is concerned, the "De procurand&acirc; Indorum salute" is perhaps more valuable than the "Historia," because it shows the standpoint from which efforts at civilizing the aborigines should be undertaken. That standpoint indicates no common perception of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature of the Indian, and of the methods of approaching him for his own benefit.

Among earlier sources, Father Eusebius Nieremberg, Anella Oliva, Historia del Peru y de los Verones insignes de la Compagnia de Jesus (1639) deserves mention, as well as Nicholas Antonio, Biblioteca Vetustisima and the Bibliography of Beristain de Souza; writers on Spanish-American literature generally mention Acosta. A good Bibliography, and a short Biography of Acosta, are found in Enrique Torres Saldanando, Los antiquos Jesuitas del Peru (Lima, 1882).
