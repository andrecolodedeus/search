<h1>Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> ecclesiastic and writer; b. at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 23 May, 1606; d. at <a href="../cathen/15426b.htm">Vigevano</a>, 8 September, 1682. He was a precocious child, early delving into serious problems in mathematics and even publishing <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> tables in his tenth year. After receiving a superficial <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at college, where his unusual ability brought rapid advancement, this prodigy turned his attention to the <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> languages, especially Chinese. He was received into the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of La Espina, in the <a href="../cathen/11417c.htm">Diocese of Palencia</a>, and after <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> entered upon a singularly varied and brilliant career. His sermons attracted the favourable attention of the Infante Ferdinand, Governor of the Low Countries, while he was attached to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Dunes in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, and in 1638 he was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with the degree of Doctor of Theology by the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>. When he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave the Palatinate, the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> made him his envoy to the court of the Emperor Ferdinand III. He was in turn <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Melrose (Scotland), Abbot-Superior of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and grand-vicar to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>. In 1648, when the Swedes attacked Prague, he armed and led a band of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> who did yeoman service in the defence of the city. His <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a> on this occasion merited for him a collar of gold from the emperor. Soon after he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Konigratz, then <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11351c.htm">Otranto</a>, and at his death was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15426b.htm">Vigevano</a>.

<p>His books are even more numerous than his titles and his varied achievements; for, according to Paquot, he published no less than 262 works on grammar, poetry, oratory, mathematics, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, physics, politics, canon law, <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and asceticism. But he produced little that is of permanent value. He <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> to defend novel theories, and in "Theologia moralis ad prima atque clarissima principia reducta" (Louvain, 1643) tried to solve <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> problems by mathematical rules. Some of his moral opinions gained for him from <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a> the title of "Prince of the Laxists".
