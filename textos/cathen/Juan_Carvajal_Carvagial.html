<h1>Juan Carvajal (Carvagial)</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>; b. about 1400 at Truxillo in Estremadura, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 6 December, 1469. Little is known of his early youth, except that he made much progress in canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, and by 1440 had attained distinction at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as auditor of the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a> and governor of the City. Thenceforth his life was to be spent mostly in the foreign service of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; his contemporary, Cardinal Jacopo Ammanati, says (Comment., I, 2, 7) that he was sent twenty-two times as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to various rulers and countries. Between 1441 and 1448 he spent much time in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and laboured, in union with <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa</a>, to placate the strong feelings of the German princes against <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>, to overcome their "neutrality" in the last, and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> phase of the Council of Basle, and to bring about the treaties known as the Concordat of the Princes (1447) and the Concordat of Aschaffenburg or <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1448; see <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">C<font size=-2>ONCORDAT</font></a>), He was rewarded by <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> (14 December, 1446) with the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal's</a> hat and the Title of St. Angelo in <em>foro piscium</em>. In 1444 and again in 1448 he was sent to <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> to promote the cause of religious unity but failed both times, owing to the stubbornness of the Calixtines and the influence of John Rokyzana, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, beloved in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, but whose <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> was suspected at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (see <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">H<font size=-2>USSITES</font></a>).

<p>In 1455 Carvajal was sent by <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Callistus III</a> to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> to preach a vigorous <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and for six years was the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the first effectual resistance made by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to the ominous progress of the Ottoman conquerors of Constantinople (1453). Aided by the famous <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> preacher, <a href="../cathen/08452a.htm">St. John Capistran</a>, he gathered an army of about 40,000 men, effected a union with the troops of <a href="../cathen/07564b.htm">John Hunyady</a>, and on 22 July, 1456, the siege of <a href="../cathen/02407a.htm">Belgrade</a>, the key of the Danube, was raised by a glorious victory that inaugurated the century-long resistance of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> to the propaganda of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. He reconciled King Ladislaus (1457), with Emperor Frederick III, and in 1458 made peace between the Magyar nobles in favour of <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias Corvinus</a> as successor of Ladislaus. He was still in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, organizing the defence of that bulwark of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, when <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> invited the princes of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to meet him at <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a> (1459) to confer on the common danger and the need of a general <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>. While <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Cardinal Bessarion</a> sought in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> something more than brilliant promises, Carvajal continued his labours in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, which he left only in the autumn of 1461, after six years of extraordinary service for the common good of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, but "grown old and feeble", says Pastor (History of the Popes), "in that severe climate, amid the turmoils of the Court and the camp, and the fatigues of travel &hellip; [in] that bleak country of moorlands and marshes". He was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12290a.htm">Porto and Santa Rufina</a> on his return. He had long held the <a href="../cathen/12157a.htm">See of Plasencia</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where a noble bridge across the Tagus, built by him, is yet known as "the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> bridge". In spite of his age and feeble health, he was still willing to take a foremost part in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> that <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> was preparing at <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a> in 1464, when the death of that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (14 August) put an end to the enterprise. His last legation was to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1466.

<p>From all his journeys Carvajal brought back nothing but the reputation of an unspotted <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> (Pastor, op. cit., IV, 131). "Such a legate", wrote the King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, "truly corresponds to the greatness of our need" (op. cit., II, 391). By his contemporaries he was considered the ornament of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, comparable to her ancient Fathers (Cardinal Ammanati) and the sole reminder of the heroic grandeur of Rome's earliest founders (Pomponius L&aelig;tus). Though genial in intercourse, there was something awe-inspiring about this saintly man whose ascetic life enabled him to provide liberally for the poor and for needy churches. <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a> mentions (Die Universit&#228;ten, I, 813) a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> founded by him at Salamanca. His discourse in the <a href="../cathen/04285a.htm">papal consistories</a>, says Pastor, was brief, simple, clear, <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>, and devoid of contemporary rhetoric; his legatine reports have the same "restrained and impersonal character". Palacky, the non-Catholic historian of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> writes of Carvajal (Geschichte B&ouml;hmens, IV, ii, 372): "Not only in <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the Faith, in moral purity and strength of character, was he unsurpassed, but he was also unequalled in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the world, in experience of ecclesiastical affairs, and in the services which he rendered to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority. It was chiefly due to his labours, prolonged during a period of twenty years, that <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at last got the better of <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> and Basle, that the nations returned to their allegiance, and that her power and glory again shone before the world with a splendour that they had not seen since the time of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>." Pastor says of him that he was absolutely free from the restless <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> and self-glorification so common among the men of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, and seemed born for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> diplomacy. His dominant <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of his life to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the promotion of the glory and power of <a href="../cathen/15403b.htm">Christ's Vicar</a>. "Pars h&aelig;c vit&aelig; ultima Christo neganda non est" (I must not refuse to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> this last portion of my life) were the words in which he offered himself to <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> as leader of a relief to the diminutive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Republic of <a href="../cathen/12633c.htm">Ragusa</a> hard pressed in 1464 by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. He left no printed works; among his <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> remains are a defence of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, reports of his legations, a volume of letters, and discourses sacred and profane. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in San Marcello al Corso. A monument erected to him there by <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion</a> bears these words: Anim&aelig; Petrus pectore C&aelig;sar erat (A Peter in spirit, a C&aelig;sar in <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>).
