<h1>Juan Fern&aacute;ndez Navarrete</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, b. at Logrono, 1526 and died at <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a>, 1579 (at Toledo, February, 1579 or 28 March, 1579?). He is called <em>el Mudo</em> (the mute) because he lost his hearing when a child of three and, in consequence, his power of speech. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, who were well to do and perhaps of noble birth placed him with the <a href="../cathen/07345a.htm">Hieronymite</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Estrella where Fray Vicente, a gifted brother, was his first teacher in art. Navarrete's talents were early discovered because he made all his wants known through rapid and vigorous black and white sketches. He may have been a pupil of Becerra, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain's</a> great fresco <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, but it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he went when a youth to the great Italian centres of art and under <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a> in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> acquired that technique and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of colour which earned him the name of "the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a>". He returned to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of repute, and travelled extensively in his native country, leaving works from his hand in her important cities. In 1568 he was made <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> to Philip II, received a salary of two hundred ducats "besides just payment for his work" and was commissioned to decorate the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a>. In 1575 he completed a "Nativity" wherein are three dominant lights; one from St. Joseph's candle, one from the glory above, and the most radiant of all from the divine Child as in Correggio's "Notte." In one "Holy Family" he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> such strange accessories, a cat, a dog, and a partridge, that the king made him promise never again to put "such indecorous things in a holy picture". Though called the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a>, Navarrete was not an imitator of any Italian; he was an original and he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> rapidly, freely, and spontaneously. His composition, especially in groups of figures, was masterly and was excelled only by that of Vel&aacute;squez. "He spoke by his pencil with the <em>bravura</em> of <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a> without his coarseness." Navarrete's work greatly influenced the development of Spanish art and after his death Lope de Vega wrote: "No countenance he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> was dumb". Despite the artists infirmity he was an agreeable companion, played cards, read, and wrote much, was broadminded and generous. When his patron ordered <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian's</a> "Last Supper" to be cut because it was too large for a place in the refectory of the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a>, it was el Mudo who protested most. In the refectory at Estrella, where he received his first instruction in <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> are some of Navarrete's best pictures. The following works may be mentioned: "Holy Family", at Weimar; "St. John in Prison", at St. Petersburg; "St. Jerome", in the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a>; "Holy Family", in the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a>.
