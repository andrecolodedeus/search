<h1>Juan Luis Vives</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, 6 March, 1492; d. at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, 6 May, 1540. Through fear of the rigours of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> he left his country forever in 1509. He first studied at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, and in 1512 settled at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, which became his second fatherland, and which he left only for numerous journeys. He returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1514, 1519, and 1536. This city attracted him, but the commotion in the streets and the sarcastic humour of the inhabitants <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to prefer <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>. Nevertheless, he was several times unfaithful to it. In 1517 he became tutor to Guillaume de Croy, who at nineteen was <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo. Residing thenceforth at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, he was appointed in 1519 professor at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and attached to the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the castle (<em>collegium castrense</em>). He lost his protector in 1521. After many comings and goings and vain efforts with <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, the duke of Alba, and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, he was attached on 12 October, 1523, to Corpus Christi College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, a foundation of <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey</a>. <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey</a>, and Queen Catherine of Aragon, to whom he had just dedicated his "De institutione feminae", treated him benevolently. Nevertheless, he often escaped from the Court and returned to <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>. During one of these absences he married the daughter of a worthy of the city, Marguerite Valdaura (26 May, 1524). <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII's</a> passion for Anne Boleyn now complicated the situation. Vives was arrested and banished for writing in defence of the queen. On his return to <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, Vives refrained from further intervention and declined when Catherine of Aragon appealed to him. During his stay at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, Vives was associated with <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> and followed almost the same line of conduct. On the advice of <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> he had published a commentary on St. Augustine's "City of God" (Basle, 1522). He displeased the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> by his irreverence for the ancient commentators, and <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> by his prolixity. His attitude eventually made him an object of suspicion during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of religion. He attempted to resume his lectures at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, but he spent nearly all the remainder of his life at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, and died when he was undertaking a general apology for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.

<p>The works of Vives are very numerous and deal with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, teaching and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, political economy, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. His books of devotion were very successful in their time; the "Introductio ad sapientiam" (1524) had fifty editions, and the "Ad animi exercitationmen in Deum commentatiumculae", eighteen. His chief work on teaching is the "Exercitatio linguae latinae" (1538) which passed through ninety nine editions. This success was deserved. The book was one of the first in which the elements of Latin were clearly and simply set forth and broke with the scholastic traditions of the grammarians of the Lower Empire and <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. In his rhetorical and literary works, especially in the "De disciplinis" (20 books, 1531), Vives formulated rules of style, insisting especially on <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and history. He advocated that history should embrace human activity in its entirety and not confine itself to accounts of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. He condemned the uncritical tales of the "Golden Legend". In philosophy he mingled with original views <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> from <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and even <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> as commentated by <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> dialecticians. Nevertheless he challenged their methods in the treatise "In pseudo dialecticos" (1519). With regard to the world and matter he professed more than one interesting opinion, such as that of evolution. His theory of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was in accord with the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> Sensism. But the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of Vives still call for deep study conducted by a specialist.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> he put forth exact theories regarding regimen, establishment of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and the conduct of the masters. He devoted a special work to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, "De institutione feminae Christianae" (1523), of which forty editions appeared. Somewhat severe in spirit, subordinating <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to man and regarding the mind of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> as inferior, Vives nevertheless demands that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> be not left in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and gives as definition of marriage: the legitimate union of one man and one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> for the mutual ownership of the whole life. Finally, in various treatises and especially in the "De subventione pauperum" (1526) Vives shows himself as an organizer of public relief. He proscribes mendicancy, expels poor strangers from the city, obliges the natives to work, recommends apprenticeship for those who have no trade, advocates asylums for the insane, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for foundlings from the age of six, and provides for the administration of all this by <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> gifts, the sale of the products of the labour of the poor the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and taxes on rich <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> communities. Ypres put these <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> into practice in 1525, despite the protests of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, which were rejected by the Parlement of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and by <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. Other cities followed this example. But Vives mingled some exaggeration with these doctrines. In the "De communione rerum" (1535) he does not seem sure of the legitimacy of private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. He had lights on many subjects, but never concentrated his efforts on a particular work.
