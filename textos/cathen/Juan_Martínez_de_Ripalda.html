<h1>Juan Mart&iacute;nez de Ripalda</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/11437a.htm">Pamplona</a>, <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a>, 1594; d. at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 26 April, 1648. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at <a href="../cathen/11437a.htm">Pamplona</a> in 1609. In the triennial reports of 1642 he says of himself that he was not physically strong, that he had studied religion, arts, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, that he had taught grammar one year, arts four, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> nineteen, and had been professed. According to <a href="../cathen/02191c.htm">Southwell</a>, he taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at Monforte, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at Salamanca, and was called from there to the Imperial College of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, where, by royal decree, he taught <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>. Later he was named censor to the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> and confessor of de Olivares, the favorite of Philip IV, whom he followed when he was exiled from <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. <a href="../cathen/02191c.htm">Southwell</a> describes his character by saying that he was a good religious, noted for his innocence. Mentally he qualifies him as subtle in argument, sound in opinion, keen-edged and clear in expression, and well-versed in <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. According to Drews, no <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> ever occupied this chair in the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a> with more honor than he, and <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a> places him, with Lugo, first among the contemporary <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and perhaps of all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Among the numerous <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> opinions which characterize him the following are worth citing: (1) He thinks that the creation of an intrinsically <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> substance is possible, in other words, that a creature is possible to which <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> grace, with the accompanying gifts and <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitive</a> vision, is due. (2) He holds that, by a positive <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> grace is conferred, in the existing providence for every good act whatsoever; so that every good act is <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, or at least that every natural good act is accompanied by another which is <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. (3) He maintains that, prescinding from the extrinsic <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, and taking into account only the nature of things, the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is called <em>lata</em> would be sufficient for justification, that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, namely, which comes by the contemplation of created things, though assent is not produced with- out grace. (4) He affirms that in the promissory revelations the formal object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> faithfulness to His promises, the constancy of His will, and the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>. (5) He asserts that all the propositions of <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a> were condemned for <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> according to the sense in which he (<a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a>) held them. (6) He maintains that the Divine maternity of the Blessed Virgin Mary is of itself a sanctifying form. The following are his works: "De ente supernaturali disputationes in universam theologiam", .three vols., I (Bordeaux, 1634), II (Lyons, 1645), III, written "Adversus Bajanos" (Cologne, 1648); rare editions like that of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 1663, have been published of the two first volumes. It is a classic work in which he included questions which are not included in ordinary <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatises. His third volume was attacked in an anonymous work, "P. Joannis Mart&iacute;nez . . . Vulpes capta per theologos . . . Academiae Lovaniensis", which Reusch says was the work of Sinnich. "Expositio brevis litterae Magistri Sententiarum" (Salamanca, 1635), praised by the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> Voet. "Tractatus theologici et scholastici de virtutibus, fide, spe et charitate" (Lyons, 1652), a posthumous work and very rare. Two new editions of all his works have been issued: Vives (8 vols., Paris, 1871-3), Palm&eacute; (4 vols., Paris, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Propaganda Fide, 1870-1). "Discurso sobre la elecci&oacute;n de sucessor del pontificado en vida del pontifice" (Seville). Uriarte says this work was published in <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, perhaps in <a href="../cathen/07513a.htm">Huesca</a>, with the anagram of Mart&iacute;n Jir&oacute;n de Palazeda, written by order of the Count de Olivares. The following are in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>: "De visione Dei" (2 vols.); "De praedestinatione"; "De angelis et auxiliis"; "De voluntate Dei" preserved in the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a>; "Discurso acerca de la ley de desaf&iacute;o y parecer sobre el desafio de Medina Sidonia a Juan de Braganza", preserved in the Biblioteca Nacional.
