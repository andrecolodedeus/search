<h1>Juan Perez</h1>  

<p>Died before 1513. At one time he held the office of <em>contador</em> or accountant to the Queen of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, showing he was of noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Later he entered the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> and distinguished himself for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and learning. Queen Isabella chose him for her confessor. Finding court life distracting he asked permission to retire to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Soon after he was elected guardian of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, half a league from Palos in <a href="../cathen/01465b.htm">Andalusia</a>, La R&aacute;bida (Arabian for hermitage, because it had once served as a <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> place of retreat). In 1200 it came into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Knights Templar</a>, who in 1221 ceded it to the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>. Father Francisco Gonzaga, Superior General of the Order (1579-87), declares that La R&aacute;bida became a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in 1261; and that it belonged to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Custody of Seville, which by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>, 21 Sept., 1500, was raised to the rank of a province. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> remained in charge of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> without interruption until the general confiscation of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> in 1835. It is now the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the nation, and used as a museum.

<p>Here <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Christopher Columbus</a> in 1484 or 1485 made the acquaintance of Perez. Father Antonio de Marchena, a cosmographer of some note, lived here, and in him the navigator discovered a man bent on the project of discovering a new world. The historian <a href="../cathen/06632a.htm">Francisco Lopez Gomara</a> in 1552 seems to have started the blunder, copied by almost every subsequent writer on the subject, of making the two names Perez and Marchena serve to describe one and the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by speaking of the Father Guardian of La R&aacute;bida as Father Juan Perez de Marchena. Both fathers materially assisted <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a>, who acknowledges his <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> in one of his letters to the king and queen. He writes that everybody ridiculed him save two <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, who always remained faithful. <a href="../cathen/10723c.htm">Navarrete</a>, indeed, claims that <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> in this passage spoke of Perez, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, and Diego de Deza, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>. As the latter was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11417c.htm">Palencia</a> when the navigator wrote his letter, and <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> on all other occasions speaks of him as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11417c.htm">Palencia</a>, or lord <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, it would seem strange that in this one instance he should omit the title. Deza aided <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> to the best of his ability among the scientists of Salamanca; but he could not prevent the adverse decision of the Spanish Court. It was Juan Perez who persuaded the navigator not to leave <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> without consulting Isabella, when, footsore and dispirited, he arrived at La R&aacute;bida, determined to submit his plan to the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. At the invitation of the queen, Perez made a journey to Santa F&eacute; for a personal interview with her. As a result <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> was recalled, and with the assistance of Cardinal Mendoza and others his demands were finally granted.

<p>When the navigator at last on 3 August, 1492, set sail in the Santa Maria, Perez blessed him and his fleet. Some writers assert that Perez accompanied his illustrious friend on the first voyage, but the silence of <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> on this point renders the claim improbable. It appears <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, however, that Perez joined his friend on the second voyage in 1493. The earliest and best writers also agree: that when the second expedition reached Haiti, Father Perez celebrated the first Mass in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> at Point Conception on 8 Dec., 1493, in a temporary structure; that this was the first church in America; and that Father Perez preserved the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> there. He also became the guardian of the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> which <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> ordered to be erected at <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>. There all trace of him is lost. Whether he returned to La R&aacute;bida or died in America is uncertain. All we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is that, in the legal dispute between Diego and <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a>, the royal fiscal, Dr. Garcia Hernandes, testified in 1513 that Father Perez was then dead.
