<h1>Juan Ponce de Le&oacute;n</h1>  

<p>Explorer, born at San Servas in the province of Campos, 1460; died in <a href="../cathen/04558c.htm">Cuba</a>, 1521.

<p>He was descended from an ancient and noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; the surname of Le&oacute;n was acquired through the <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriage</a> of one of the Ponces to Do&ntilde;a Aldonza de Le&oacute;n, a daughter of Alfonso IX. As a lad Ponce de Le&oacute;n served as page to Pedro Nu&ntilde;uz de Guzm&aacute;n, later the tutor of the brother of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, the Infante Don Fernando. In 1493, Ponce sailed to Hispaniola (<a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">San Domingo</a>) with <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> on his second voyage, an expedition which included many aristocratic young men, and adventurous noblemen who had been left without occupation after the fall of <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a>. When Nicol&aacute;s Ovando came to Hispaniola in 1502 as governor, he found the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">natives</a> in a state of revolt, and in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which followed Ponce rendered such valuable services that he was appointed Ovando's lieutenant with headquarters in a town in the eastern part of the island. While here, he heard from the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indians</a> that there was much <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> in the neighbouring Island of Buriquien (<a href="../cathen/12291b.htm">Porto Rico</a>), and he asked and obtained permission to visit it in 1508, where he discovered many rich <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">treasures</a>; for his work in this expedition he was appointed <em>Adelantado</em> or Governor of Boriquien. Having reduced the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">natives</a>, he was soon afterward removed from office, but not until he had amassed a considerable <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">fortune</a>. At this time stories of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Eastern Asia</a> were prevalent which told of a famous spring the waters of which had the marvellous virtue of restoring to youth and vigour those who drank them. Probably the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> heard from the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indians</a> <a href="../cathen/09121a.htm">tales</a> that reminded them of this <em>Fons Juventutis,</em> and they got the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that this fountain was situated on an island called Bimini which lay to the north of Hispaniola.

<p>Ponce obtained from <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, 23 February, 1512, a patent authorizing him to discover and people the Island of Bimini, giving him <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the island for life, and bestowing upon him the title of <em>Adelantado.</em> On 3 March, 1513, Ponce set out from San German (<a href="../cathen/12291b.htm">Porto Rico</a>) with three ships, fitted out at his own expense. Setting his course in a northwesterly direction, eleven days later he reached Guanahani, where <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> first saw land. Continuing his way, on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a> (<em>Pascua de Flores</em>), 27 March, he came within sight of the coast which he named <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a> in honour of the day and on account of the luxuriant vegetation. On 2 April he landed at a spot a little to the north of the present site of St. Augustine and formally took possession in the name of the Crown. He now turned back, following the coast to its southern extremity and up the west coast to latitude 27&#176;30', and then returned to <a href="../cathen/12291b.htm">Porto Rico</a>. During this trip he had several encounters with the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">natives</a>, who showed great <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and determination in their attacks, which probably accounts for the fact that Ponce did not attempt to found a settlement or penetrate into the interior in search of the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">treasure</a> which was believed to be hidden there.

<p>Although his first voyage had been without result as far as the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">gold</a> and <a href="../cathen/14041a.htm">slaves</a>, and the discovery of the "fountain of youth" were concerned, Ponce determined to secure possession of his new discovery. Through his friend, Pedro Nu&ntilde;ez de Guzm&aacute;n, he secured a second grant dated 27 September, 1514, which gave him power to settle the Island of Bimini and the Island of Florida, for such he thought <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a> to be. In 1521 he set out with two ships and landing upon the <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a> coast, just where, it is not known, he was furiously attacked by the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">natives</a> while he was building houses for his settlers. Finally driven to re-embark, he set sail for <a href="../cathen/04558c.htm">Cuba</a>, where he died of the wound which he had received.
