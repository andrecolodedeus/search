<h1>Juan de Medina</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a>; born 1490; died 1547; he occupied the first rank among the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the sixteenth century. He was born at Medina de Pomar in the Province of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, and not at <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a> as some writers state. Very little has been written about his life though he is repeatedly quoted and praised by several <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of his time. He entered the College of St. Ildefonsus at <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a>, 20 May, 1516, took doctor's degrees in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and soon after was made canon and master of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. He was selected as primary professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the College of St. Ildefonsus in succession to Michael Carasco, whom Cardinal Ximenes wished to be made perpetual Rector of the College: "Ximenes perpetuum rectorem esse voluerit". From about 1526 and for the space of twenty years, Medina filled his position with the greatest distinction. Alvarez Gomez says that Medina had a wonderful power of presenting the most intricate questions in a simple and clear style so that his pupils had no difficulty in understanding him &#151; "nihil esset tam perplexum aut obscurum quod vel tardissimus non assequeretur". His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of study impaired his health he died at the age of fifty-seven years. Medina's works are principally on <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> and ethics. Some of his opinions were not in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> propounded at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. The "Diccionario Enciclop. Hispano Americano" says that his treatise "de Poenitientia" was put on the Index published in 1707; the edition of the Index printed in 1711 does not give Medina's work, nor does any of the subsequent editions. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> declares that at the hour of death there is no "reservatio" and that all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> can absolve "in articulo mortis". Medina says "that <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> given by an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is invalid"; and again, "at a time of necessity (arliculo necessitatis) any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, not suspended or <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> can absolve any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>". His opinions on the "materia" for sacramental <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, and on the "Copia confessariorum" seem opposed to the teaching of the council on these points. Alvarez Gomez and Andrea Schott state that <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Media</a> was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Ildefonsus. The first lines of the epitaph on his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> are: <blockquote> Complutense decus jacet hic, attente viator <br>Ter tumultum lustra, ter pia thura crema <br>Hoc moriente silet vox, qua non clarior unquam <br>Compluti fulsit, nec fuit illa. </blockquote>

<p>Many editions of Medina's works were printed in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. His brother John de Medina brought out the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> books at <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a> in 1544 and sqq.; Salamanca, 1555; Ingoldstadt, 158I; Brescia, 1590-1606; Cologne, 1607 etc.
