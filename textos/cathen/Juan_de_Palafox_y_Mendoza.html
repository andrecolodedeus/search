<h1>Juan de Palafox y Mendoza</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of La Puebla de Los Angeles, b. at Fitero in <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a>, 24 June, 1600; d. at <a href="../cathen/11339a.htm">Osma</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 1 October, 1659. He was a son of Jamie Palafox y Mendoza, Marquess of Ariza. After studying at the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a>, he was appointed to the Council of War and of the Indies at the Court of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. In 1629 he renounced this dignity and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He accompanied Princess Mary as almoner to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and upon his return was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Puebla de Los Angeles, 27 December, 1839, and appointed "visitador general" of Mexico. He arrived there, June, 1640. He soon came in conflict with the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and Augustinians, whose many exemptions and privileges he looked upon as encroachments on his episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. In may, 1642, he received secret advice from <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> to take temporary charge of the Government, in place of the viceroy, Villena, who had been accused of financial mismanagement and secret sympathies with the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> rebels in New Spain. At the same time he was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Mexico. From 10 June to 23 November, 1642, he was acting viceroy, but would not accept the dignity of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. During his viceroyalty of five months, he corrected many financial abuses, framed new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> for the University of Mexico, and to root out <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> among the aborigines, destroyed many <a href="../cathen/02169b.htm">Aztec</a> idols and other <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> antiquities collected by preceding viceroys.

<p>In 1647 began his conflict with the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. The reason for the strife was the numerous exemptions and privileges which the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries had enjoyed in Mexico since the beginning of the seventeenth century, and which, in the opinion of Palafox, undermined his episcopal authority. In a letter to <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 25 May, 1647, he denounced the use which the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were making of their privileges and asked the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for redress. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> answered with a brief, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 18 May, 1648, in which he sustains the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in all disputed points of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, but exhorts him to be more kind and lenient towards the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. A second letter to <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Pope Innocent X</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 8 January, 1649, more acrimonious than the first, is often attributed to Palafox, but was probably forged by enemies of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, as it is disavowed by Palafox in a defense of his actions which he addressed to Philip IV of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 1652. In May, 1649, Palafox left for <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. On 27 May, 1653, <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> issued a new brief, in which he confirmed his previous decision in favour of Palafox. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/11339a.htm">Diocese of Osma</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 24 November, 1652. He spent the remainder of his life labouring with his usual <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the spiritual welfare of his flock, which <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> and reverenced him as a saint.

<p>The process of his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> was introduced in 1726 under <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, and was continued during the pontificates of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>. At the last session which was held on 28 February, 1777, twenty-six out of forty-one votes favoured his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> suspended the final decision. His literary products, consisting chiefly of ascetic, pastoral, and historical treatises in <a href="../cathen/14192a.htm">Spanish</a> were published in fifteen volumes (Madrid, 1762).
