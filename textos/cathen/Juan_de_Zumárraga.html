<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Juan de Zum&aacute;rraga</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/05208c.htm">Durango</a> in the Basque provinces in 1468; died in Mexico, 3 June, 1548. He entered the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, and in 1527 was custodian of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Abrojo, where he received <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. Shortly afterwards he was appointed one of the judges of the court for the examination of <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witches</a> in the Basque province. From his writings it would appear that he looked upon <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witches</a> merely as <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> possessed of hallucinations. By this time more detailed accounts of the importance of the conquest of <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Hernan Cortes</a> began to be received, and on 20 December, 1527, Zum&aacute;rraga was recommended by <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> for the dignity of first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Mexico. Without having been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and with only the title of bishop-elect and Protector of the Indians, he left <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> with the first civil officials, auditors (<em>Oidores</em>), towards the end of August, 1528, and reached Mexico, 6 December. Thirteen days after, two auditors, Parada and Maldonado, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of years and experience, died. Their companions, Matienzo and Delgadillo, assumed their authority, which was also unfortunately shared by Nuno de Guzm&aacute;n, who had come from his territories in Panuco. Their administration was one of the most disastrous epochs in new <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and one of great difficulty for Bishop Zum&aacute;rraga. <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cortes</a> had returned to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> just previous to this and in his absence no limits seem to have been placed to the abuses of the auditors. They impoverished the Indians by taxes, sold them into slavery, branded them with hot irons, sent shiploads to the Antilles, offered <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to Indian girls, and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> with incredible fury the followers of <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cortes</a>.

<p>Bishop Zum&aacute;rraga, as Protector of the Indians, endeavoured vainly to defend them. His position was a critical one; the Spanish Court had not defined the extent of his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and his faculties as Protector of the Indians. Moreover, he had not received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and was thus at a disadvantage. The Indians appealed to him as protector with all kinds of complaints, sometimes greatly exaggerated. His own <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who had so long laboured for the welfare of the Indians, pressed him to put an end to the excesses of the auditors. It was clear that he must have an open conflict with the civil officials of the colony, relying only on his spiritual prerogatives, which commanded no respect from these immoral and unprincipled men. Unfortunately, some members of other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> perhaps of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, upheld the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a> of the Indians. Bishop Zum&aacute;rraga attempted to notify the Spanish Court of the course of events, but the crafty auditors had established a successful censorship of all letters and communications from New Spain. Finally, a Biscayan sailor concealed a letter in a cake of wax which he immersed in a barrel of oil.

<p>Meanwhile news reach Mexico that <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cort&eacute;s</a> had been well received at the Spanish Court and was about to return to New Spain. Fearful of the consequences, Guzm&aacute;n left Mexico, 22 December, 1529, and began his famous expedition to <a href="../cathen/10282a.htm">Michoacan</a>, Jalisco, and <a href="../cathen/14012a.htm">Sinaloa</a>. The two other auditors remained in power and continued their outrages. In the early part of 1530 they dragged a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and a former servant of <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cort&eacute;s</a> from a church, quartered him and tortured his servant. Bishop Zum&aacute;rraga place the city under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> retired to Texcoco. At <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> was removed, but the auditors were <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for a year longer. On 15 July, 1530 <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cort&eacute;s</a>, invested with the title of Captain General of New Spain, reached Vera Cruz. The Court appointed new auditors, among them Sebastian Ramirez de Fuenleal, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>, and the lawyer Vasco de Quiroga, afterward the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10282a.htm">Michoacan</a>. In December of the same year the new "Audiencia" reached Mexico, and with their arrival began an era of peace for both Bishop Zum&aacute;rraga and the Indians. Matienzo and Delgadillo were sent as <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, but Nu&ntilde;o de Guzm&aacute;n escaped, being then absent in <a href="../cathen/14012a.htm">Sinaloa</a>. According to ancient and constant tradition it was at this time (12 December, 1531) that the apparition of <a href="../cathen/07043a.htm">Our Lady of Guadalupe</a> took place.

<p>Meantime the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> spread by the enemies of Zum&aacute;rraga and the partisans of the first auditor had shaken the confidence of the Spanish Court, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> received an order to repair to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. He set sail in May, 1532. On his arrival he met his implacable enemy Delgadillo, who, though still under indictment, continued his <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>. Owing to this no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> had held back the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 2 September, 1530, naming Zum&aacute;rraga <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Zum&aacute;rraga had, however, little difficulty in vindicating his good name, and was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at Valladolid on 27 April, 1533. After another year in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, busied with matters relative to the welfare of the colony and favourable concessions for the Indians, he reached Mexico in October, 1534, accompanied by a number of mechanics and six <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> teachers for the Indian girls. He was no longer Protector of the Indians, as the paternal administration of the new auditors rendered this office unnecessary. On 14 November, 1535, with the arrival of the first viceroy, Antonio de Mendoza, the rule of the new auditors ended, but Mendoza was no less paternal in his treatment of the Indians. According to <a href="../cathen/10601a.htm">Fray Toribio de Motolinia</a> the number of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> Indians in Mexico in 1536 numbered five millions.



<p>They were a flourishing community, but the difficulties of the situation must be borne in mind in order to appreciate the task that confronted the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mexico. The great multitude of Indians who asked for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, said to have greatly increased after the apparition of <a href="../cathen/07043a.htm">Our Lady of Guadalupe</a> in 1531, forced the missionaries to adopt a special form for administering this sacrament. The <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> were ranged in order, the children in front, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were recited in common over all, the salt, saliva, etc., applied to a few, and then water was poured on the head of each one without using the <a href="../cathen/07421b.htm">holy oils</a> nor <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">chrism</a>, because these were not to be had. So long as the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> were in charge of the missions there was no question raised, but as soon as members of other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and some <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular ecclesiastics</a> arrived, <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> began to be cast upon the validity of these <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>. To put an end to dispute Bishop Zum&aacute;rraga submitted the case to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and on 1 June, 1537, <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> issued the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Altitudo divini consilii", which declared that the Friars had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in administering <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> under this form, nothing being said with regard to its validity since on this score there could be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, but decreed that in future it should not be thus administered except in cases of urgent need.

<p>Other difficulties arose apropos of marriage. In their <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> condition the Indians had many wives and <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubines</a>, and when they were converted the question arose which were wives and which were <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubines</a>, and if perchance there had been a valid marriage with any one of these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that certain rites were observed for certain unions; that in some cases where separation or <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> was desired, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to obtain the consent of the authorities, and that in other cases the consent of the interested parties sufficed; that therefore there were valid marriages among the Indians. Others denied that this was the case. Bishop Zum&aacute;rraga took part in all these discussions until the case was submitted to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> in the same <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Altitudo" decreed that the converted Indians should keep the first <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> they had taken to wife.

<p>A third important difficulty concerned the position of the regulars and their privileges. <a href="../cathen/01159b.htm">Adrian VI</a> on 9 May, 1522, directed to <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> the famous <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Exponi nobis fecisti", by which he transferred to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and other <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> his own Apostolic authority in all matters in which they judged it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the conversion of the Indians, excepting for such acts as required episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. This provision affected regions where there was no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or where it required two or more days of travel to reach him. <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> confirmed this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> on 15 January, 1535. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> found their authority much limited, and a series of assemblies followed in which Zum&aacute;rraga with his customary <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> tried to arrive at an understanding with the regulars without openly clashing with them. Various modifications were adopted with the consent of the regulars on condition that these "should not impair the privileges of the regulars". The question therefore remained open. In 1535 Bishop Zum&aacute;rraga received from the Inquisitor General, Alvaro Manrique, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, the title of Apostolic Inquisitor of the <a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">city of Mexico</a> and of the entire diocese with extensive faculties, including that of delivering criminals to the secular courts. He never availed himself of this title nor established the tribunal, although he did indict and deliver to the secular courts a resident of Tezcoco who was accused of having reverted to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and offering human <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>.

<p>Meanwhile <a href="../cathen/03397a.htm">Las Casas</a> had gone to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and obtained from the famous Junta of Valladolid (1541-1542) the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the celebrated "Nuevas Leyes". These <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> conclusively and decisively prohibited the enslavement of the Indians, withdrew all grants from all kinds of corporations, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or secular, and from those who were or had been viceroys, governors, or employees of any description whatsoever; previous grants were reduced; Indians were taken from owners who had ill-treated them; all governors were deprived of the faculty to "encomendar" (a system of patents which amounted to a virtual enslavement of the Indians); owners were compelled to live upon their own possessions; and in all newly discovered territory no grants could be made. Francisco Tello de Sandoval, commissioned to carry out the new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> reached Mexico on 8 March, 1544. The gravest difficulties confronted him. Those affected by the new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were almost all the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> of the colony, many of them far advanced in years, who had passed through all the trying period of the conquest, and whom the new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> would leave in abject poverty. These had recourse to Bishop Zum&aacute;rraga to intercede with Tello to obtain a suspension of the order until they could be heard before the Spanish Court. The representatives of the colonists found the emperor, <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, at <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, on 20 October, 1545. In virtue of the situation as explained to him, he modified the general tenor of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> so that while still correcting the principal abuses, they would not bear too heavily on the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> of the colony. Through the prudent intervention of Bishop Zum&aacute;rraga and the compliance of Tello, Mexico was undoubtedly saved from a bloody civil struggle such as engulfed <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> on account of the enforcement of these same <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and from which the Indians emerged worse off than they were before.

<p>The last years of Bishop Zum&aacute;rraga's life were devoted to carrying out the numerous works he had undertaken for the welfare of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Among the chief of these should be mentioned: the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for Indian girls; he famous Colegio Tlaltelolco; the introduction of the first printing press into the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>; the foundation of various <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, especially those of Mexico and Vera Cruz; the impetus he gave to industries, agriculture, and manufactures, for which he brought trained mechanics and labourers from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; and the printing of many books. At the instance of the emperor, <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> separated (11 February, 1546) the See of Mexico from the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Seville, and erected the <a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">Archdiocese of Mexico</a>, appointing Bishop Zum&aacute;rraga first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and designating the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/11180a.htm">Oaxaca</a>, <a href="../cathen/10282a.htm">Michoacan</a>, <a href="../cathen/14747c.htm">Tlaxcala</a>, <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, and Ciudad Real de <a href="../cathen/03652b.htm">Chiapas</a>, as suffragans. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of appointment was sent on 8 July, 1548, but Bishop Zum&aacute;rraga had died one month previously.
