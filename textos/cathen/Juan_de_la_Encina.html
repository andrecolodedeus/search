<h1>Juan de la Encina</h1>  

<p>(JUAN DE LA ENZINA).

<p><a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> dramatic poet, called by Ticknor the father of the Spanish secular drama; b. in the village of Encina near Salamanca, 7 Aug., 1468; d. in Salamanca, 1534. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a>, whence he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, where at the age of twenty-five he became a member of the household of Fadrique de Toledo, first Duke of Alba. Later, Encina went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he took orders, and owing to his skill in music attracted the attention of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> who made him <em>maestro di capella</em>, which was a signal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. In 1519 he accompanied Fadrique Afan de Ribera, Marquis of Tarifa, on a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Holy Land, where he remained two years, and upon his return in 1521 he published a poetical account of his travels, rather devoid of literary merit, under the title "Trabagia o Via Sagrada de Hierusalem". At a more advanced age, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a> and returned to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where he died. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of that city.

<p>Encina published the first edition of his works under the title of "El Cancionero". This was reprinted five times during the sixteenth century, showing that he enjoyed great popularity. Although he wrote lyrical poems, songs, and <em>villancios</em> in the old Spanish style, his most important works were his dramatic compositions which he himself calls <em>representaciones</em>, and which fill the fourth division of his "Cancionero". They are eleven in number, all in the nature of eclogues, and written in some form of old Spanish verse; in all there is singing, and in one of them a dance. They therefore have several elements of the secular drama, the origin of which, according to Ticknor, can be traced no further back by any existing authentic monument. Two things must be considered, however, in connexion with these compositions as the foundation of the secular drama. One is that they are eclogues in form and name but not in substance; the second, that they were really acted before an audience. The date of these performances has been given as early as 1492. The <em>representaciones</em> have not much dramatic merit. They are crude and slight, and there is no pretension to a plot. Some of the most important works of Encina are: "The Triumph of Love", "The Knight who turns Shepherd", and "The Shepherds who turn Courtiers". He was also the author of a prose work on the condition of the poetic art in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> entitled "Arte de Poesia Castellana", published about 1497.
