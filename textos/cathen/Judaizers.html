<h1>Judaizers</h1>  

<p>(From Greek <em>Ioudaizo</em>, to adopt Jewish customs &#151; <a href="../bible/est008.htm#vrs17">Esther 8:17</a>; <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs14">Galatians 2:14</a>).

<p>A party of Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the Early Church, who either held that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and the observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a> were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and in consequence wished to impose them on the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> converts, or who at least considered them as still <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on the Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Although the Apostles had received the command to announce the Gospel to all the nations, they and their associates addressed themselves at first only to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, converts to Judaism, and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, that is to those who were <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> and observed the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>. The converts, and the Apostles with them, continued to conform to Jewish customs: they observed the distinction between legally <a href="../cathen/04010c.htm">clean and unclean</a> food, refused to eat with <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> or to enter their houses, etc. (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#vrs14">Acts 10:14, 28</a>; <a href="../bible/act011.htm#vrs3">11:3</a>). At <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> they frequented the Temple and took part in Jewish <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> as of old (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs46">Acts 2:46</a>; <a href="../bible/act003.htm#vrs1">3:1</a>; <a href="../bible/act021.htm#vrs20">21:20-26</a>), so that, judged from external appearances, they seemed to be merely a new Jewish <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> distinguished by the union and charity existing among its members. The <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> ceremonial law was not to be permanent indeed, but the time had not yet come for abolishing its observance. The intense attachment which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had for it, amounting to fanaticism in the case of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, would have forbidden such a step, had the Apostles contemplated it, as it would have been tantamount to shutting the door of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.

<p>But sooner or later the Gospel was also to reach the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and then the delicate question must immediately arise: What was their position with respect to the Law? Were they bound to observe it? And if not, what conduct should the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> hold towards them? Should the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> waive such points of the Law as were a barrier to free relations between <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a>? To the mind of most Palestinian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and especially of the zealots, only two solutions would present themselves as possible. Either the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> converts must accept the Law, or its provisions must be enforced against them as against the other uncircumcised. But national sentiment, as well as <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the Law, would impel them to prefer the first. And yet neither solution was admissible, if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was to embrace all nations and not remain a national institution. The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> would never have accepted <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> with the heavy yoke of Mosaism, nor would they have consented to occupy an inferior position with regard to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, as they necessarily must, if these regarded them as unclean and declined to eat with them or even to enter their houses. Under such conditions it was easy to foresee that the admission of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> must provoke a crisis, which would clear the situation. When the brethren at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, among whom probably were already converts of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, learned that Peter had admitted <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a> and his household to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> without subjecting them to <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, they loudly expostulated with him (<a href="../bible/act011.htm#vrs1">Acts 11:1-3</a>). The cause assigned for their complaints is that he "had gone in to men uncircumcised and had eaten with them", but the underlying reason was that he had dispensed with <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. However, as the case was an exceptional one, where the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was manifested be <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> circumstances, Peter found little difficulty in quieting the dissatisfaction (<a href="../bible/act011.htm#vrs4">Acts 11:4-18</a>). But new conversions soon gave rise to far more serious trouble, which for a time threatened to produce a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h2>Council of Jerusalem (A.D. 50 or 51)</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> that broke out at the time of <a href="../cathen/14287a.htm">St. Stephen's</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> providentially hastened the hour when the Gospel was to be preached also to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Some natives of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and Cyrene, driven from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, went to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and there began to preach not only to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but also to the Greeks. Their action was probably prompted by the example set by Peter at <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">Caesarea</a>, which their more liberal views as Hellenists would naturally dispose them to follow. With the help of Barnabas, whom the Apostles sent on hearing that a great number of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were converted to the Lord at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and of the former persecutor Saul, a flourishing church, largely <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a>, was established there (<a href="../bible/act011.htm#vrs20">Acts 11:20 sqq.</a>). Soon after (between A.D. 45-49) Saul, now called Paul, and Barnabas founded the South Galatian churches of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm#II">Antioch in Pisidia</a>, <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a>, <a href="../cathen/04738c.htm">Derbe</a>, and Perge, thus increasing the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> converts (<a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs13">Acts 13:13</a>-<a href="../bible/act014.htm#vrs24">14:24</a>). Seeing the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> element growing so large and threatening the outnumber the Jewish, the zealots of the Law took alarm. Both their national <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and their religious sentiment were shocked. They welcomed the accession of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, but the Jewish complexion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must be maintained, the Law and the Gospel must go hand in hand, and the new converts must be <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Some went down to Antioch and preached to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> that unless they received <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, which as a matter of course would carry with it the observance of the other <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> prescriptions, they could not be saved (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs1">Acts 15:1</a>). As these men appealed to the authority of the Apostles in support of their views, a delegation, including Paul, Barnabas, and Titus, was sent to Jerusalem to lay the matter before the Apostles, that their decision might set at rest the disquieted minds of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> at Antioch (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs2">Acts 15:2</a>).



<p>In a private interview which Paul had with Peter, James (the brother of the Lord), and John, the Apostles then present at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, they approved his teaching and recognized his special mission to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs1">Galatians 2:1-9</a>). But to still the clamours of the converts from Pharisaism who demanded that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> converts "must be circumcised and be commanded to observe the Law of Moses", the matter was discussed in a public meeting. Peter arose and after recalling how <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a> and his household, though uncircumcised, had received the Holy Ghost as well as they themselves, declared that as <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is by the grace of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the yoke of the Law, which even the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> found exceedingly heavy, should not be imposed on the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> converts. James after him voiced the same sentiment, but asked that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> should observe these four points, namely "that they refrain themselves from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood". His suggestion was adopted and, with slight change in the wording, incorporated in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> which "the apostles and ancients, with the whole church" sent to the churches of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Cilicia through two delegates, Judas and Silas, who were to accompany Paul and Barnabas on their return. "Forasmuch as we have heard," so ran the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, "that some going out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>: to whom we gave no commandment;. . .it hath seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us, to lay no further burden upon you than these <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> things: that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication [by which marriages within certain degrees of kindred are probably meant]; from which things keeping yourselves you shall do well" (<a href="../bible/act015.htm#vrs5">Acts 15:5-29</a>). These four prohibitions were imposed for the sake of charity and union. As they forbade practices which were held in special abhorrence by all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, their observance was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to avoid shocking the Jewish brethren and to make free intercourse between the two classes of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> possible. This is the drift of the somewhat obscure reason which St. James adduced in favour of his proposition: "For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, where he is read every <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>." The four things forbidden are severely prohibited in Lev., xvii, xviii, not only to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, but also to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> living among them. Hence the Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who heard these injunctions read in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, would be <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a> if they were not observed by their <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> brethren. By the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Apostles the cause of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> liberty was won against the narrow Judaizers, and the way smoothed for the conversion of the nations. The victory was emphasized by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> refusal to allow Titus to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> even as a pure concession to the extremists (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs2">Galatians 2:2-5</a>).
<h2>The incident at Antioch</h2>

<p>The decision of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> regarded the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> alone, since the only question before the council was whether <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and the observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a> were to be imposed on the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Nothing was decided with regard to the observance of the Law by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Still even they were implicitly and in principle freed from its <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>. For, if the legal observances were not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> was no more bound by them than the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a>. Nor was anything explicitly decided as to the relations which were to subsist between the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Such a decision was not demanded by the circumstances, since at Antioch the two classes lived together in harmony before the arrival of the mischief-makers. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04775c.htm">Dispersion</a> were less particular than those of Palestine, and very likely some arrangement had been reached by which the Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> could without scruple eat with their <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> brethren at the agape. However, the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the four prohibitions, which were intended to facilitate relations, implied that <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> could freely meet. Hence when Peter came to Antioch shortly after the council, he, no less than Paul and Barnabas and the others, "did eat with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>" (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs12">Galatians 2:12</a>). But the absence of any explicit declaration gave the Judaizers an opportunity to begin a new agitation, which, if successful, would have rendered the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> nugatory. Foiled in their first attempt, they now insisted that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of not eating with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> be strictly observed by all <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. They very likely expected to reach by indirect methods, what they could not obtain directly. Some zealots came from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to Antioch. Nothing warrants the assertion that they were sent by St. James to oppose <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, or to enforce the separation of the Jewish from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, much less to <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgate</a> a modification of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. If they were sent by St. James &#151; <em>pro tou elthein tinas apo Iakobou</em> &#151; probably means simply that they were of James's entourage &#151; they came on some other commission.

<p>On their arrival Peter, who up to this had eaten with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, "withdrew and separated himself, fearing them who were of the circumcision", and by his example drew with him not only the other <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but even Barnabas, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> fellow-labourer. Foreseeing the consequences of such conduct, Paul publicly rebuked him, because he "walked not uprightly according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Gospel". "If thou being a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>," he said to him, "livest after the manner of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and not as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> do, how dost thou compel the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to live as do the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>?" This incident has been made much of by Baur and his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> as showing the existence of two primitive forms of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, Petrinism and Paulinism, at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with each other. But anyone, who will look at the facts without preconceived theory, must see that between Peter and Paul there was no difference in principles, but merely a difference as to the practical conduct to be followed under the circumstances. "Conversationis fuit vitium non praedicationis", as <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> happily expresses it. That Peter's principles were the same as those of Paul, is shown by his conduct at the time of <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius's</a> conversion, by the position he took at the council of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and by his manner of living prior to the arrival of the Judaizers. Paul, on the other hand, not only did not object to the observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a>, as long as it did not interfere with the liberty of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, but he conformed to its prescriptions when occasion required (<a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs20">1 Corinthians 9:20</a>). Thus he shortly after <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> Timothy (<a href="../bible/act016.htm#vrs1">Acts 16:1-3</a>), and he was in the very act of observing the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> ritual when he was arrested at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/act021.htm#vrs26">Acts 21:26 sqq.</a>). The difference between them was that Peter, recently come from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, thought only of not wounding the susceptibility of the zealots there, and was thus betrayed into a course of action apparently at variance with his own teaching and calculated to promote the designs the Judaizers; whereas Paul, not preoccupied with such a consideration and with more experience among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, took a broader and truer view of the matter. He saw that Peter's example would promote the movement to avoid close relations with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, which was only an indirect way of forcing Jewish customs upon them. He saw, too, that if such a policy were pursued, the hope of converting the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> must be abandoned. Hence his bold and energetic action. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> account of the incident leaves no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that St. Peter saw the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the rebuke. (In the above account <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs1">Galatians 2:1-10</a>, is with the large majority of commentators taken to refer to the Council of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and the incident at Antioch is consequently placed after the council. Some few interpreters, however, refer <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs1">Galatians 2:1-10</a>, to the time of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> journey mentioned in <a href="../bible/act011.htm#vrs28">Acts 11:28-30</a> [A.D. 44], and place the dispute at Antioch before the council.)
<h2>The Judaizers in other churches</h2>

<p>After the foregoing events the Judaizers could do little mischief in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. But they could carry their agitation to the distant churches founded by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, where the facts were less well known; and this they attempted to do. The two Epistles to the Corinthians give good reason to believe that they were at work at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>. The party or rather faction of Cephas (<a href="../bible/1co001.htm#vrs12">1 Corinthians 1:12</a>) very probably consisted of Judaizers. They do not seem, however, to have gone beyond belittling <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> authority and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and sowing distrust towards him (cf. <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs1">1 Corinthians 9:1-5</a>; <a href="../bible/2co011.htm#vrs5">2 Corinthians 11:5-12</a>; <a href="../bible/2co012.htm#vrs11">12:11-12</a>; <a href="../bible/2co001.htm#vrs17">1:17-20</a>; <a href="../bible/2co010.htm#vrs10">10:10-13</a>). For while he has much to say in his own defence, he does not attack the views of the Judaizers, as he would certainly have done had they been openly preached. His two letters and his subsequent visit to Corinth put an end to the party's machinations. In the meantime (supposing <a href="../bible/gal000.htm">Galatians</a> to have been written soon after <a href="../bible/1co000.htm">1</a> and <a href="../bible/2co000.htm">2 Corinthians</a> as it very probably was) Judaizing emissaries had penetrated into the Galatian churches, whether North or South Galatian matters little here (see <a href="../cathen/06336a.htm">EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS</a>), and by their skillful maneuvers had almost succeeded in persuading the Galatians, or at any rate many of them, into accepting <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. As at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> they attacked <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> authority and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. He was only a secondary Apostle, subordinate to the Twelve, from whom he had received his instruction in the Faith and from whom he held his mission. To his teaching they opposed the practice and teaching of the pillars of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of those who had conversed with the Lord (<a href="../bible/gal002.htm#vrs2">Galatians 2:2 sqq.</a>). He was a time-server, changing his teaching and conduct according to circumstances with the view of ingratiating himself with men (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs10">Galatians 1:10</a>; <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#vrs11">5:11</a>). They argued that <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> had been instituted as a sign of an eternal alliance between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: if the Galatians then wished to have a share in this alliance, with its <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>, if they wished to be in the full sense of the term <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, they must accept <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs3">Galatians 3:3 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#vrs2">5:2</a>). They did not however insist, it would seem, in the observance of the whole Law (v, 3).

<p>On hearing the news of the threatened defection of the churches which he had founded at such cost to himself, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> hastily indited the vigorous <a href="../bible/gal000.htm">Epistle to the Galatians</a>, in which he meets the accusations and arguments of his opponents step by step, and uses all his powers of persuasion to induce his <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> to stand fast and not to be held again under the yoke of bondage. The letter, as far as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, produced the desired effect. In spite of its resemblance to the Epistle to the Galatians, the Epistle to the Romans is not, as has been asserted, a polemical writing directed against the Judaizing party at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The whole tone of the Epistle shows this (cf. in particular i, 5-8, 11-12; xv, 14; xvi, 19). If he refers to the Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, it is only to exhort the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to bear with these weak brethren and to avoid whatever might <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalize</a> them (xiv, 1-23). He would not have shown such forbearance towards the Judaizers, nor spoken of them in such gentle tones. His purpose in treating of the uselessness of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and legal observances was to forewarn and forearm the Romans against the Judaizing disturbers, should they reach the capital, as he had reason to fear (<a href="../bible/rom016.htm#vrs17">Romans 16:17-18</a>). After their attempt in Galatia, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> opponents seem to have relaxed their activity, for in his later letters he rarely alludes to them. In the Epistle to the Philippians he warns against them in very severe terms: "Beware of dogs, beware of evil-workers, beware of the concision" (<a href="../bible/phi003.htm#vrs2">Philippians 3:2</a>). They do not seem, however, to have been active in that church at the time. Beyond this only two allusions are found &#151; one in <a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#vrs6">1 Timothy 1:6-7</a>: "From which things some going astray, are turned aside unto vain babbling: desiring to be teachers of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, understanding neither the things they say, nor whereof they affirm"; the other in Tit., iii, 9: "Avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. For they are unprofitable things and vain."
<h2>Final history</h2>

<p>With the disappearance of the Jewish-Christian community of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> at the time of the rebellion (A.D. 67-70), the question about <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> and the observance of the Law ceased to be of any importance in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and soon became a dead issue. At the beginning of the second century <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">St. Ignatius of Antioch</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, still warns against Judaizers (Magnes., x, 3; viii, 1; Philad., vi, 1), but the danger was probably more a memory than a reality. During the rebellion the mass of the Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Palestine retired beyond the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, where they gradually lost touch with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> split up into several <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> (about 140) distinguishes two kinds of Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>: those who observe the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law of Moses</a>, but do not require its observance of others &#151; with these he would hold communion, though in this all his contemporaries did not agree with him &#151; and those who believe the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a> to be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on all, whom he considers <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> (<a href="../fathers/01283.htm"><em>Dialogue with Trypho</em> 47</a>). If <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> is describing the Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of his day, as he appears to do, they had changed little since Apostolic times. The accounts of later Fathers show them divided into three main <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>: (a) the Nazarenes, who, while observing the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a>, seem to have been <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. They admitted the Divinity of Christ and the virginal birth; (b) the <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>, who denied the Divinity of Christ and virginal birth, and considered <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> as an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>. It should be noted, however, that though the Fathers restrict the name <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm"><em>Ebionite</em></a> to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, the name was common to all; (c) an offshoot of the last infected with <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a> (cf. art. <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">EBIONITES</a>). After the middle of the fifth century the Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> disappear from history.
