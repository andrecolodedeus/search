<h1>Julian Klaczko</h1>  

<p>Polish author, b. at <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, 6 November, 1825, of Jewish <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, 26 November, 1906. After taking the doctor's degree in 1847 at the University of K&ouml;nigsberg, he went to Heidelberg to continue his studies under Gervinus, who appointed him a collaborator on the "Deutsche Zeitung", a periodical for Russian and Polish affairs. In 1848 he spent some time in the Grand Duchy of Posen and published at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> his first political pamphlet, "Die deutschen Hegemonen", an open letter to Gervinus againt the incorporation of Posen in the German Confederation. About this time he resolved to become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but deferred his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for a time owing to <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parental</a> opposition. His father having met with financial reverses, Klaczko was left without means, and in 1850 went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he supported himself by his literary labours. His articles written in French and published chiefly in the "Revuede Paris", were so brilliant as to win speedy fame for the young author. The death of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, meanwhile, left him free to enter the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and he was accordingly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. From 1857 to 1860, with the collaboration of <a href="../cathen/08593c.htm">Valerian Kalinka</a>, he published a monthly, "Wiadomosci Polskie" (Polish News), the general tone of which was opposed to revolutionary impulses and sudden uprisings. Viewed from a political, as well as from a literary and &aelig;sthetic standpoint, Klaczko's articles were the most effective and most brilliant that had ever appeared in the Polish language. The periodical was put under the ban in Russian <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and Galicia, and in 1860 also in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, after which it had to be discontinued on account of a lack of subscribers.

<p>In 1862 there appeared in the"Revue Des Deux Mondes" Klaczko's "Le poete anonyme", the first adequate appreciation of <a href="../cathen/08698b.htm">Sigmund Krasinski</a>, and so excellently done that it became the basis of all later account of the poet. This paper assured Klaczko's literary reputation among the French. Soon afterwards occurred the unfortunate uprising of 1863. While any Polish organization or activity outside of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> itself was now impossible, Klaczko did not forget the cause of his country. From official diplomatic sources he compiled information on all the details of the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> and Polish questions, and in 1866 published his "Etudes de diplomatie", a sharp but veiled criticism of the policy of the Powers, to the disadvantage of all save <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. The "Etudes" caused a great sensation, which was increased by the author's subsequent work "Les preliminairesde Sadowa", in which he shows how <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> was drawn into <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> (1886).

<p>Klaczko's writings bore such strong testimony to his political talents that he was appointed by Count Benst on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, holding in addition a seat in the Galician Diet at <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>, and in the Diet which was out of harmony with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria's</a> policy of neutrality during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1870 he signed his public offices and returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> penniless, to devote himself with renewed vigour to the artistic and literary pursuits of his youth. After several years of work he published "Causeries florentines", a study of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> in the form of a dialogue, containing in one volume the substance of all that scholars and critics had said on the subject. Even before this he had produced, in 1875, his "Deux chanceliers", a brilliant portrayal of the characters and policies of Princes Bismarck and Gortschakoff. Finally, he planned an extensive work under the title of "La papaute et la renaissance", to show the effects produced on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> by the worldly spirit of some pontiffs, without in the least derogating from the greatness of any epoch. Of the three volumes "Julius II", "Leo X", and "Clement VII and the Sack of Rome", only the first was completed, and by the time of its publication Klaczko was already in the state of paralysis in which he spent the last eight years of his life. <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated in his little drawing-room twice a week until his death. Klaczko was by far the most powerful <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the most brilliant writer of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> during the latter half of the nineteenth century.
