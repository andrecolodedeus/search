<h1>Julian of Eclanum</h1>  

<p>Born about 386; died in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, 454; the most learned among the leaders of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> movement and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Eclanum near Beneventum. He was the son of Memorius, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in Apulia, and his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> career began in hls father's church, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> and subsequently <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. About 417 he was raised to episcopal rank by <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a>, and placed in charge of a see variously styled <em>Eclana, Eclanum, Eculanum, &AElig;clanum or &AElig;culanum</em>. There is no means of deciding how Julianus, who enjoyed an enviable reputation for learning, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, was led to ally himself with the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> party. When <a href="../cathen/15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a> issued, in 418, his "Epistola Tractatoria", Julianus was one of the eighteen <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who refused to subscribe to the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> which it contained. In consequence of this refusal he was exiled under the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07460a.htm">Emperor Honorius</a>, which pronounced banishment against <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> and his sympathizers. Driven from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 421, he commenced an active literary campaign in the interests of the new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and by his writings soon won for himself the position of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> leader of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> party. To him is due the credit of having systematized the teachings of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> and Coelestius. His writings, which were frankly <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a>, were largely directed against the doctrines which St. Augustine had defended, and for several years after the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> the history of the conflict is merely an account of the controversy between Julian and Augustine. Most of Julian's works are lost, and are known only through the copious quotations found in the works of his great adversary. Principal among them are the letter to Rufus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, and the epistle to the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, which Augustine, at the request of <a href="../cathen/02658a.htm">Pope Boniface</a>, refuted in his work "Against Two Letters of the Pelagians"; the reply to Augustine's work "De Nuptiis et Concupiscentia"; and his answer to Augustine's defense of his own work. Driven from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, he found refuge for a time with <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, who, though sympathetic, subsequently subscribed to his condemnation. At the accession of each pontiff Julian sought to have the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> controversy re-opened, but this merely resulted in further condemnations by Celestine, <a href="../cathen/14032a.htm">Sixtus III</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a>. For a time he enjoyed the patronage and friendship of Nestorius, the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, and the protection of the Emperor Theodosius II. But Marius Mercator, by his "Commonitorium de Coelestio", opened the eyes of the emperor to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> character of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>. By reason of this Julian was expelled from Constantinople. His subsequent career, with the exception of his attempts to conciliate the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, is not known. Julian was the most learned among the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, and, though superior to <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> and Coelestius, his system did not differ materially from theirs.
