<h1>Julian the Apostate</h1>  

<p>(FLAVIUS CLAUDIUS JULIANUS).

<p>Roman emperor 361-63, b. at Constantinople in 331, d. 26 June, 363, son of Julius Constantius, the half-brother of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>. With his stepbrother Gallus, who was some years older, he escaped the massacre of his kinsfolk at Constantinople after the death of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>, and was brought up by the eunuch Mardonius and the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Nicocles&mdash;the latter secretly a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>. The suspicious Emperor Constantius sent Julian later to the castle of Macellum in Cappadocia. Julian received a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> training, but the recollection of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of his relatives sowed in him a bitter resentment against the authors of that massacre, and he extended this <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in general. When Constantius became involved in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in the West with the usurper Magnentius, he named Gallus his colleague, with the title of Caesar. Julian was allowed to study at Constantinople, but his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> character aroused attention and caused Constantius to send him in 350 to Nicomedia. Here Julian devoted himself exclusively to <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonic</a> philosophy, mixed with all kinds of magic and mysteries. The <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonist</a>, Maximus of Ephesus, dazzled him by his fantastic teachings and prophesied his destined task, the restoration of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>. When, at the close of 354, Constantius recalled Gallus Caesar to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and had him beheaded for his manifold cruelties, Julian was taken a state <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, but, gaining the sympathy of the Empress Eusebia, secured permission to visit in 355 the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, where Greek philosophy and rhetoric were enjoying their last period of prosperity. Julian now went over completely to the so-called Hellenism, and was initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries.

<p>Julian was presented on 6 November, 355, to the army as Caesar, married the emperor's youngest sister Helena, and then sent to Gaul. Here he at once displayed great ability, both as soldier and administrator. He boldly advanced from his headquarters at Vienne to <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, and thence made a sally into the territory of the Alamanni on the Upper Rhine, occupying and garrisoning Cologne, which a year before had been taken and sacked by the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. The following year, although not supported by the troops of Constantius, he completely routed over 30,000 Alamanni near Strasburg. He then returned by way of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and Julich to <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> and Lutetia (Paris). In a later expedition he opened the Rhine again for the passage of ships: in 359 he even made his way into the heart of the territory of the Alamanni (the present Wurtemberg). Julian also displayed an unwearied activity in promoting just taxation and administration of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. In the meantime <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> had again broken out with <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, King Sh&acirc;p&ucirc;r demanding the cession of Mesopotamia and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. Long jealous of Julian, the emperor now ordered the latter to send a part of his most experienced German auxiliaries, although these troops had been enlisted for the Gallic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> only. Against the advice of Julian the imperial commissioner Decentius in the winter of 360 started with the picked troops by way of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and stopped here to rest: a mutiny now broke out, the troops appeared before Julian's residence, and enthusiastically proclaimed him Augustus. To avoid a civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, Julian sought to come to an agreement with Constantius whom he was ready to acknowledge as supreme emperor. Constantius. however, demanded the unconditional surrender of the title of Caesar and of his position as governor of Gaul. Neither the army nor the people would consent to this, and Julian advanced in the spring to Illyricum, taking possession of the capital, <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>. Shapur having disbanded his great <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a> army, Constantius now planned to turn his entire fighting strength against his rebellious cousin Julian. While on the march, however, Constantius died, 3 November, 361.

<p>Julian advanced in triumph to Constantinople. Hitherto outwardly a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, he now let himself be portrayed as under the protection of Zeus, who in his opinion possessed with Helius the same undivided creative power. He commanded all towns to reopen the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> for <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> worship, restored animal <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and assumed the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of a Pontifex Maximus. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were united in fighting their enemy. Julian issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> that all titles to lands, <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a> bestowed since the reign of Constantine upon the Galileans, as he contemptuously called the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, were abrogated, and that the moneys granted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from the revenues of the State must be repaid. He forbade the appointment of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> as teachers of rhetoric and grammar. Still, he copied the organization of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>; he created, for example, a form of <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, the head of which was the imperial Pontifex Maximus, and urged <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> to imitate such <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">Christian virtues</a> as charity and mercy. Yet Julian's changes failed to bring him any appreciable success. His attempt to defy the Gospel and rebuild the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple at Jerusalem</a> was brought to nothing by fire and earthquake.

<p>In May, 362, Julian left Constantinople for <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and made active preparations at Antioch for a great <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. While at Antioch in the winter of 362-63, he wrote his books against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. In March, 363, he advanced from Antioch into Mesopotamia, successfully crossed the Tigris, and fought a successful battle with the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>. Burning his supply fleet, he now marched into the interior of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, but soon found himself <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> by lack of provisions to begin a retreat, during which he was beset by the Persian cavalry. On 26 June, 363, he was wounded in the side by an arrow in a small cavalry skirmish, and died during the night. Various reports concerning the circumstances of his death have come down to us. Both <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> believed the rumor that he cried out when dying: <em>Nenikekas Galilaie</em> (Thou hast conquered, O Galilean). With Julian the dynasty of Constantine came to an end. He was rather a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <em>litt&eacute;rateur</em> of a somewhat visionary character, than a great ruler whose actions were the dictates of strong will and principles. The good beginnings of a just government which he showed in Gaul were not maintained when he was sole ruler. Although his personal life was unostentatious, he was passionate, arbitrary, vain, and prejudiced, blindly submissive to the rhetoricians and magicians. Some of Julian's many controversial writings, orations, and letters have been preserved, showing his discordant, subjective character.
