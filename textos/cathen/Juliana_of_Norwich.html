<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Juliana of Norwich</h1>  

<p>English <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystic</a> of the fourteenth century, author or recipient of the vision contained in the book known as the "Sixteen Revelations of Divine Love".

<p>The original form of her name appears to have been Julian. She was probably a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, living as a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a> in an anchorage of which traces still remain in the east part of the churchyard of St. Julian in <a href="../cathen/11121a.htm">Norwich</a>, which belonged to Carrow Priory.

<p>According to her book, this <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revelation</a> was "shewed" to her on 8 or 14 May (the readings differ), 1373, when she was thirty years and a half old. This would refer her birth to the end of 1342. Her statement, that "for twenty years after the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of this <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">shewing</a>, save three months, I had teaching inwardly", <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a> that the book was not written before 1393. An early fifteenth-century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, recently purchased for the British Museum from the Amherst Library, states that she "yet is on <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, Anno Domini 1413". It is probable that this is the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> cited by Francis Blomefield, the eigtheenth-century historian of Norfolk, and that a misreading of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> led to the statement that she was still living in 1442.

<p>Attempts have been made to identify her with Lady Julian Lampet, the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchoress</a> of Carrow, references concerning <a href="../cathen/09115a.htm">legacies</a> to whom occur in documents from 1426 to 1478; but this is manifestly impossible. The newly-discovered <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> differs considerably from the complete version hitherto known, of which it is a kind of condensation, lacking the beginning and the end. Only three, much later, <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the fuller text are known to exist. The earliest, in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (from which the book was first edited by <a href="../cathen/04486b.htm">Serenus de Cressy</a> in 1670), dates from the sixteenth century; the other two, both in the British Museum and not independent of each other, belong to the seventeenth. The better of the latter is evidently a copy of a much earlier original.</p>

<p>Whatever be their precise <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, these "Revelations", or "Shewings", are the most perfect fruit of later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Juliana described herself as a "simple creature unlettered" when she received them; but, in the years that intervened between the vision and the composition of the book, she evidently acquired some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> phraseology, and her work appears to show the influence of <a href="../cathen/07355a.htm">Walter Hilton</a>, as well as <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonic</a> <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogies</a>, the latter probably derived from the anonymous author of the "Divine Cloud of Unknowing". There is one passage, concerning the place in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> side for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> that shall be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>, which argues an acquaintance with the letters of <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> insight with which she describes her condition, distinguishing the manner of her vision and recognizing when she has to deal with a mere delusion, is worthy of <a href="../cathen/14515b.htm">St. Teresa</a>. When seemingly at the point of death, in the bodily sickness for which she had <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in order to renew her spiritual life, she passes into a trance while <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplating</a> the crucifix, and has the vision of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's suffering</a> "in which all the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">shewings</a> that follow be grounded and joined". </p>

<p>The book is the record of twenty years' meditation upon that one experience; for, "when the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">shewing</a>, which is given for a time, is passed and hid, then <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> keepeth it by grace of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> unto our lives end". More than fifteen years later, she received "in ghostly understanding" the explanation, the key to all religious experience: "What? wouldest thou wit thy Lord's meaning in this thing? Wit it well: <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Love</a> was His meaning. Who sheweth it thee? <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Love</a>. Wherefore sheweth He it thee? For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Hold thee therein, thou shalt wit more in the same. But thou shalt never wit therein other without end." With this illumination, the whole <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a> and the purpose of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> became clear to her, and even the possibility of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> does not trouble her, but is made "a bliss by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>". This is the great deed, transcending our <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a> shall do at the last day: "Thou shalt see thyself that all manner of thing shall be well."

<p>Like St. Catherine, Juliana has little of the <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is frequent in the <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystics</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in our "sensuality" as well as in our "substance", and the body and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> render mutual aid: "Either of them take help of other till we be brought up into stature, as kind worketh." Knowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of self are inseparable: we may never come to the knowing of one without the knowing of the other. "God is more nearer to us than our own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>", and "in falling and rising we are ever preciously kept in one <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>." She lays special stress upon the "homeliness" and "courtesy" of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> dealings with us, "for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> maketh might and wisdom full meek to us." With this we must correspond by a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> confidence; "failing of comfort" is the "most mischief" into which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can fall. In the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> would have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> see how they are <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a>. Throughout her <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> Juliana submits herself to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: "I yield me to our mother <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Holy Church</a>, as a simple child oweth." </p>
