<h1>Julius Africanus</h1>  

<p>(c. 160-c. 240; the full name is Sextus Iulius Africanus, Greek <em>Sextos Ioulios Aphrikanos</em>).

<p>Julius Africanus is the father of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> chronography. Little is known of his life and little remains of his works. He is important chiefly because of his influence on <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, on all the later writers of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Church history</a> among the Fathers, and on the whole Greek <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of chroniclers. His name says that he was an African; <a href="../cathen/14328a.htm">Suidas</a> calls him "a Libyan <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>". Gelzer ("S. Julius Africanus", pp. 4, 5) thinks he was of Roman descent. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Greek (in which language he wrote), Latin, and Hebrew. He was at one time a soldier and had been a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>; he wrote all his works as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a> <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> that he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> from the fact that he addresses the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (in his letter to him) as "dear brother" ("M&eacute;moires pour servir &agrave; l'histoire eccl&eacute;siastique", III, Paris, 1693, 254). Gelzer (op. cit., 9) points out that a friendly <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">Christian layman</a> could quite well use such a form. The statement that Julius Africanus was a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> does not appear till the fourth century. It is probably an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. He went to Alexandria to study, attracted by the fame of its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, possibly about the year 215 (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.31</a>). All the dates of his life are uncertain. One tradition places him under the <a href="../cathen/06648b.htm">Emperor Gordianus</a> (238-244; Gelzer, p. 7), another mentions him under <a href="../cathen/13743a.htm">Alexander Severus</a> (222-235; id., p. 6). He appears to have known Abgar VIII, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> King of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> (176-213); in his Chronography he calls him a "holy man" (Gelzer, p. 3). <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, in his <a href="../cathen/05616a.htm">chronicle</a> (ad a. Abr., 2239, ed. Schoene, II, <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1875, 178), says that under <a href="../cathen/13743a.htm">Alexander Severus</a> the city of <a href="../cathen/05405a.htm">Emmaus</a> in Palestine was restored and called Nikopolis under the direction of "Julius Africanus the writer of the Chronicle". It appears that he lived there for a time (Bardenhewer, "Patrologie", Freiburg, 1894, p. 173). He shows in his Chronicle that he knows the topography of Palestine (Gelzer, p. 10). He seems to have been in Greece; he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> about the year 221 (id., 11). Bardenhewer (op. cit., p. 173) puts his death at about 237. Preuschen (in Harnack, "Gesch. der altchristlichen Litteratur", p. 507) says that he died "after 221" and adds "under <a href="../cathen/06648b.htm">Gordianus</a> 238-244?". Harnack ("Realenc. f&uuml;r prot. Theol. u. Kirche", Leipzig, 1901, IX, 627) says, "after 240".

<p>The works of S. Julius Africanus are: (1) The "Chronicle" (Gk. <em>Chronographiai</em>) in five books, covering the time from the Creation (B.C. 5499 in his calculation) to the third year of Eliogabalus (A.D. 221). Gelzer thinks he wrote this work between 212 and 221 (op. cit., 12). It is an attempt to combine the account in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and the secular (Roman and Greek) history known to the author, with special regard to <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a>. From the third book the order is strictly chronological. Julius uses as sources first the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, then Greek, Roman, and Jewish historians, especially Justus of <a href="../cathen/14716a.htm">Tiberias</a>, who depends on <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>. He is also influenced by the <a href="../fathers/0210.htm">"Stromata"</a> of <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (Gelzer, 19-24). As the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> attempt at a universal history, and as the source of all later <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> chronography, this work is of great importance. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> made it the foundation of his <a href="../cathen/05616a.htm">chronicle</a>. It is the source of all later Byzantine writing of history, so that for centuries the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a> accepted the dates and epochs calculated by Julius. Only fragments of this work are now extant.

<p>(2) The "Embroideries" (Gk. <em>kestoi</em>; compare the title of Clem. Alex.: <em>stromata</em>), also called "Puzzles" (Gk. <em>paradoxa</em>), is a kind of encyclopedia of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> &#151; mathematics, botany, medicine, etc. &#151; full of all manner of curious anecdotes and illustrations. It has been thought that the author of this work was a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, Sextus Africanus, different from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Julius Africanus. This is directly contradicted by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05616a.htm">"Chronicle"</a> (<a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.31</a>): "Africanus (the author of the 'Chronographia'), writer of the composed Embroideries" (Gk. <em>ho ton epigegrammenon keston syggrapheus</em>). Gelzer (2-3) has shown that the author of the kestoi was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> (he quotes <a href="../bible/psa033.htm#vrs9">Psalm 33:9</a>) and that there is no reason to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius's</a> statement. This work, too, constantly quoted and much esteemed by the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, survives only in a few fragments about agriculture and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> (Gelzer, 13-16). It had originally twenty-four books. It is from the kestoi, in which the author discourses of magic, divination and medicine, that the opinion arose that he was a physician.

<p>(3) Two letters of Julius are known, one to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, in which he disputes the authenticity of the story of Susanna, pointing out that the play upon words in the Greek text (<em>prinos</em>, an oak-tree, and <em>prio</em>, to saw asunder; <em>schinos</em>, a mastic-tree and <em>schizo</em>, to cleave: <a href="../bible/dan013.htm#vrs54">Daniel 13:54-55, 58-59</a>) would not exist in Hebrew or Aramaic. From his address in this letter (<em>Kyri&eacute; mou kai hui&eacute;</em>) he seems to have been an old man when he wrote it. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> answered it. Both letters are included in <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> works (e.g., ed. of De la Rue, I, Paris, 1733, 10). This letter is the only one of Julius's works that is completely extant. His criticism has won for him high respect among modern writers. J. G. Rosenm&uuml;ller (Historia Interpretationis, III, 161) considers that these few lines contain more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> than is to be found in all <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> works. Gelzer (p. 17) points out that the "Chronography" and especially the kestoi show that Julius does not deserve his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> as a critic. The other letter is addressed to a certain Aristides. In it he proposes what is still the favourite explanation of the two pedigrees of our Lord (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm#vrs2">Matthew 1:2-19</a>; <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs23">Luke 3:23-38</a>), namely that St. Joseph's two fathers, Jacob (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm#vrs16">Matthew 1:16</a>) and Heli (<a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs23">Luke 3:23</a>), were half-brothers of the same mother, that Heli died without children, and Jacob took his wife to raise up seed to his brother according to the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levitical</a> law (<a href="../bible/deu025.htm#vrs5">Deuteronomy 25:5-6</a>). Of this letter a fragment is preserved by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250101.htm"><em>Church History</em> I.7</a>), another fragment is contained in an epitome of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius's</a> "Qu&aelig;stiones de differ. Evang.", published by <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">A. Mai</a> ("Nova Patrum bibliotheca", IV, Rome, 1852). Julius also translated <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian's</a> "Apologeticum" into Greek (Harnack in "Texte und Untersuchungen", VIII, 4).

<p>Later Syrian writers mention works that have disappeared. Dionysius Bar-Salibi speaks of a commentary on the Gospels (Assemani, "Bibliotheca Orientalis", II, Rome, 1721, 158), Ebed-Jesu of commentaries on the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> (Hebediesu, "Catalogus librorum chald&aelig;orum", Rome, 1633, p. 15). Spurious works are the Acts of <a href="../cathen/14379a.htm">St. Symphorosa</a> (Ruinart, "Acta primorum martyrum", Ratisbon, 1859, 70), a Latin version of Abdias's "History of the Apostles" ("Histori&aelig; apostolic&aelig;, auctore Abdia", Cologne, 1576, which asserts throughout, even in the title, that it was translated from the Hebrew by Julius Africanus) and an astonishing semi-pagan "Interpretation of the things that happened in Persia through the Incarnation of our Lord and God and Saviour, Jesus Christ" (ed. by Ignaz von der Hardt in J. C. von Aretin's "Beitr&auml;ge zur Gesch. u. Litter.", II, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 104, 52-69). <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> in his "de Viris illustribus" (no. 63) includes: "Julius Africanus, of whom five books <em>de temporibus</em> [=the Chronography] are extant, accepted a mission for the restoration of the city of <a href="../cathen/05405a.htm">Emmaus</a>, afterwards called Nicopolis, under the <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus</a>, who succeeded Macrinus. There is a letter to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> about the question of Susanna in which he says that this fable is not in the Hebrew, nor does <em>apo tou prinou prisai kai apo tou schisou schisai</em> agree with Hebrew etymology; against whom <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> wrote a learned letter. There exists also another letter of his to Aristides in which he discusses at length the disagreement which seems to be in the genealogy of the Saviour in Matthew and Luke." Except for the wrong date (M. Aurelius) this account, taken from <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, represents very fairly what we know of Africanus.
