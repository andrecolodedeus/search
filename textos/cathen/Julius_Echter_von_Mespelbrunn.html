<h1>Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn</h1>  

<p>Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, b. 18 March, 1545, in the Castle of Mespelbrunn, Spessart (Bavaria); d. 13 Sept., 1617, at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>. Descended from an ancient <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in the service of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, he received a good <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of that city, also at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, Paris, <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; it was in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that he became a licentiate of canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. In 1567 he entered on his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as canon of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, an office to which he had been appointed in 1554; in 1570 he became the dean of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, and in 1573, at the age of twenty-eight, even before his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, was appointed Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>. Various causes had combined to bring the diocese into a sad state. Deeply in <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> and poorly administered, it had an almost entirely <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> population. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, in point of virtue and learning, were for the most part unequal to their task, and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter was adverse to any <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform. During the first ten years of Echter's government the attempt to unite the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> and the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, after the deposition of the Prince-Abbot Balthasar von Dernbach, caused much confusion. This was due to the youthful <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of Echter, and not, as some wish to interpret it, a sign of any anti-Catholic sentiments on his part. From the outset he endeavoured to carry out a thorough <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> restoration. For this reason he encouraged, as far as possible, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and promoted their beneficient ministry. In the same spirit he conceived the plan of founding a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, and despite all difficulties it was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> opened (2 Jan., 1582) and became a model for all similar <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a> institutions. Under the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> it flourished, grew rapidly, and furnished the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and officials needed to counterbalance the more or less irreligious temper of the population. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was now able to take decisive steps against <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. He banished all <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> preachers from his territory and removed all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who were unwilling to observe the rules of their office. The public officials had to be <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and none but <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers could be appointed. He began, moreover, courses of careful instruction for non-Catholics, and to some extent threatened them with penalties and even with banishment. Within three years about 100,000 returned to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Public worship was also improved by the introduction of new devotions, processions, and the establishment of confraternities. Bishop Echter restored ruinous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> or devoted their revenues to the erection of new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and to the building of three hundred new churches. The tapering towers of these churches, called after the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> "Julius towers", still preserve his memory. His most beneficial and lasting monument, after the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, is the Julius Hospital, which he founded with the endowment of the abandoned <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Heiligenthal. By skilful administration he improved the decadent <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> conditions of his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> states, reduced taxes, perfected the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and established many primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. In a word, he proved himself one of the most capable rulers of his time. Not only in his own diocese did he display an extraordinary and varied activity, but as the founder and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the Catholic League, he exercised a decisive influence on the future of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>.
