<h1>Juste</h1>  

<p>The name conventionally applied to a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a>, whose real name was Betti, originally from San Martino a Mensola, near Florence. Giusto, whose name was afterwards given to the whole <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and Andrea are the first two known to us. Neither seems to have gone out of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. But Andrea had three sons &mdash; Anthony (1479-1519), Andrew (born about 1483), and John, the most illustrious of the house (1485-1549) &mdash; all of whom early <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and figured prominently during the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. With Francesco Laurana they stand as the most brilliant representatives and the most active emissaries of Italian art beyond the Alps.

<p>As early as 1504 the three brothers were in Brittany, at Dol, executing the monument of Bishop Thomas James. Later, they separated. Anthony worked for the Cardinal d'Amboise in the famous castle of Gaillon; while John, attracted to <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, spent a few years in the atelier of Michel Colombe, famous as the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> of the "Entombment" in the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">Solesmes</a>. Colombe was the last representative of the Dijon School, founded by Claus Sluter under the first dukes of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. At his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> John Juste became imbued with the realism of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, slightly softened and tempered with French delicacy. Through this combination of qualities, he created for himself a style whose charm consisted in its flexibility and complexity. At the death of Michel Colombe (1512) the Justes worked again in concert and inherited his fame. <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> commissioned them to execute the famous mausoleum of Louis XII at St-Denis, and this occupied almost fifteen years (1516-31). But Anthony's share in this work was slight, as he died in 1519. The <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of this magnificent masterpiece belongs entirely to his brother John.

<p>The original conception seems to have been Perr&eacute;al's, and yet it was not wholly his. The iconography of <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> was extremely rich in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the fifteenth century. Its main theme consists of a <em>gisant</em> or recumbent effigy of the deceased, laid upon a funeral couch surmounting the sarcophagus, upon the sides of which a procession of mourners is represented. The most celebrated example of this style is the monument of Philip the Bold by Claus Sluter, at <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a> (1405), of which there have been several variants, down to the monument of Philippe Pot (1480) in the Louvre. The <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Louis XII inaugurated a new tradition, or rather a colossal development of the subject. The hero is represented kneeling on a catafalque beneath which the <em>gisant</em> appears as a naked, emaciated corpse, "such as death has made it for us". This striking contrast is in itself a most eloquent funeral oration. The monument is an incomparable masterpiece; it has served as the type of many others, and would, alone, be sufficient to bring glory to an artist; but it is not the only work we have of John Juste. He also executed the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Philippe de Montmorency and of Artus Gouffier in the church of Oiron (Deux-S&egrave;vres), that of Jean Rieux, at Ancenis, of Thomas Bohier, at St-Saturnin, <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, and of the Abb&eacute; Louis de Cr&eacute;vent at the Trinit&eacute;, Vend&ocirc;me. He had one son, John the second, the last <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, who died in 1577, and of whom some works are to be seen in the churches of Oiron and Champeaux.
