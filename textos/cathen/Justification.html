<h1>Justification</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>justificatio</em>; Greek <em>dikaiosis</em>.)

<p>A biblio-ecclesiastical term; which denotes the transforming of the sinner from the state of unrighteousness to the state of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and sonship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Considered as an act (<em>actus justificationis</em>), justification is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, presupposing, however, on the part of the adult the process of justification and the cooperation of his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> preventing and helping grace (<em>gratia praeveniens et cooperans</em>). Considered as a state or habit (<em>habitus justificationis</em>), it denotes the continued possession of a quality inherent in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> aptly term <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. Since the sixteenth century great differences have existed between <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature of justification. As the dogmatic side of the controversy has been fully explained in the article on <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">GRACE</a>, we shall here consider it more from an historical point of view.
<h2 id="section1">The Protestant doctrine on justification</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> on which the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> built their system of justification, except perhaps fiduciary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, were by no means really original. They had been conceived long before either by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of the earlier centuries or by isolated <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and had been quietly scattered as the seed of future <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. It was especially the representatives of <a href="../cathen/01564b.htm">Antinomianism</a> during the Apostolic times who welcomed the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone suffices for justification, and that consequently the observance of the moral law is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> either as a prerequisite for obtaining justification or as a means for preserving it. For this reason St. Augustine (De fide et operibus, xiv) was of the opinion that the Apostles James, Peter, John, and Jude had directed their Epistles against the <a href="../cathen/01564b.htm">Antinomians</a> of that time, who claimed to have taken their doctrines &#151; so dangerous to morality &#151; from the writings of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. Until quite recently, it was almost universally accepted that the epistle of St. James was written against the unwarranted conclusions drawn from the writings of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. Of late, however, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetes</a> have become more and more convinced that the Epistle in question, so remarkable for its insisting on the necessity of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, neither aimed at correcting the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> interpretations of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, nor had any relation to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle of the Gentiles</a>. On the contrary, they believe that St. James had no other object than to emphasize the fact &#151; already emphasized by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> &#151; that only such <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as is active in charity and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> (<em>fides formata</em>) possesses any power to justify man (cf. <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#vrs6">Galatians 5:6</a>; <a href="../bible/1co013.htm#vrs2">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>), whilst <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> devoid of charity and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> (<em>fides informis</em>) is a dead <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and in the eyes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> insufficient for justification (cf. <a href="../bible/jam002.htm#vrs17">James 2:17 sqq.</a>). According to this apparently correct opinion, the Epistles of both Apostles treat of different subjects, neither with direct relation to the other. For St. James insists on the necessity of works of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Christian charity</a>, while <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> intends to show that neither the observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish Law</a> nor the merely natural <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> are of any value for obtaining the grace of justification (cf. Bartmann, "St. Paulus u. St. Jacobus und die Rechtertigung", Freiburg, 1897).

<p>Whether Victorinus, a <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonist</a>, already defended the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of justification by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, is immaterial to our discussion. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> there were a few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> among the <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a> (Occam, Durandus, Gabriel Biel), who went so far in exaggerating the value of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> in the matter of justification that the efficiency and dignity of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> was unduly relegated to the background. Of late, Fathers <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a> and Weiss have shown that <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Martin Luther</a> was acquainted almost exclusively with the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of these <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a>, which he naturally and justly found repugnant, and that the <a href="../summa/index.html">"Summa" of St. Thomas</a> and the works of other great <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> were practically unknown to him. Even <a href="../cathen/13086a.htm">Ritschl</a> ("Christliche Lehre von der Rechfertigung und Versohnung", I, 3rd ed., Bonn, 1889, pp. 105, 117) admits that neither the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in her official teaching nor the majority of her <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> ever sanctioned, much less adopted, the extreme views of the <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a>. Nevertheless it was not a healthy reaction against <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a>, but <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> own state of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> that caused his change of views. Frightened, tormented, worn out by constant reflexions on his own sinfulness, he had finally found, even before 1517, relief and consolation only in the thought that man cannot overcome <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself is a necessity. This thought naturally led him to a consideration of the fall of man and its consequences. <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">Original sin</a> has so completely destroyed our likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our moral faculties in the natural order, that our will has lost its freedom regarding works morally good or bad, and we are consequently condemned to commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in every action. Even what we consider <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> are nothing but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Since, according to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, of which death alone shall free us, constitutes the essence of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, all our actions are corrupted by it. Concupiscence as an intrinsically <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> disposition, has instilled its deadly poison into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, its faculties, and its action (cf. M&ouml;hler, "Symbolik", sec. 6). But here we are forced to ask: If all our moral actions be the outcome of an internal necessity and constraint, how can <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> still speak of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning of the word? Does not <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> become identical with the "Evil Substance" of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, as later on <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> follower, Flacius Illyricus, quite <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> admitted?



<p>Against this dark and desolate background there stands out the more clearly the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who for the sake of the Redeemer's merits lovingly offers to despairing man a righteousness (<em>justitia</em>) already complete in itself, namely the exterior righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or of Christ. With the "arm of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" the sinner eagerly reaches out for this righteousness and puts it on as a cloak of grace, covering and concealing therewith his misery and his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Thus on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, justification is, as the Formulary of Concord (1577) avows, a mere external pronouncement of justification, a forensic <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and its eternal punishments. This <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> is based on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> imputes to man's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Cf. Solid. Declar. III de fide justif., sec. xi: "The term justification in this instance means the declaring just, the freeing from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the eternal punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in consideration of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of Christ imputed to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p>What then is the part assigned to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in justification? According to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> (and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> also), the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that justifies is not, as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> teaches, a firm <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> and promises (<em>fides theoretica, dogmatica</em>), but is the infallible conviction (<em>fides fiducialis, fiducia</em>) that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the sake of Christ will no longer impute to us our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but will consider and treat us, as if we were really just and holy, although in our inner selves we remain the same sinners as before. Cf. Solid. Declar. III, sec. 15: "Through the obedience of Christ by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the just are so declared and reputed, although by reason of their corrupt nature they still are and remain, sinners as long as they bear this mortal body." This so-called "fiduciary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" is not a religious-moral preparation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, nor a <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of cooperation on the part of the sinner; it is merely a means or spiritual instrument (<em>instrumentum, organon leptikon</em>) granted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to assist the sinner in laying hold of the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thereby to cover his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in a purely external manner as with a mantle. For this reason the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> formularies of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> lay great stress on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that our entire righteousness does not intrinsically belong to us, but is something altogether exterior. Cf. Solid. Declar., sec. 48: "It is settled beyond question that our <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is to be sought wholly outside of ourselves and that it consists entirely in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>." The contrast between <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> here becomes very striking. For according to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the righteousness and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> which justification confers, although given to us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as efficient cause (<em>causa efficiens</em>) and merited by Christ as meritorious cause (<em>causa meritoria</em>), become an interior sanctifying quality or formal cause (<em>causa formalis</em>) in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, which it makes truly just and holy in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> system, however, remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is no real forgiveness, no blotting out of guilt. Sin is merely cloaked and concealed by the imputed merits of Christ; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> no longer imputes it, whilst in reality it continues under cover its miserable existence till the hour of death. Thus there exist in man side by side two hostile brothers as it were &#151; the one just and the other <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>; the one a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, the other a sinner; the one a child of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the other a slave of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> &#151; and this without any prospect of a conciliation between the two. For, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by His merely judicial <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not take away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself, but spreads over it as an outward mantle His own righteousness. The <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> (and <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a>) <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on justification reaches its climax in the assertion that "fiduciary faith", as described above, is the only requisite for justification (<em>sola fides justificat</em>). As long as the sinner with the "arm of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" firmly clings to Christ, he is and will ever remain regenerated, pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the child of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and heir to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Faith, which alone can justify, is also the only requisite and means of obtaining <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Neither repentance nor penance, neither <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, nor any other virtue is required, though in the just they may either attend or follow as a result of justification. (Cf. Solid. Declar, sec. 23: "Indeed, neither contrition nor <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> nor any other virtue, but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone is the means by which we can reach forth and obtain the grace of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the merit of Christ and the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.") It is well known that <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> in his German translation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> falsified <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#vrs28">Romans 3:28</a>, by interpolating the word "alone" (by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <em>alone</em>), and to his critics gave the famous answer: "Dr. Martin Luther wants it that way, and says, 'Papist and ass are the same thing: sic volo, sic jubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas'."

<p>Since neither charity nor <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> contribute anything towards justification &#151; inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone justifies &#151; their absence subsequently cannot deprive the just man of anything whatever. There is only one thing that might possibly divest him of justification, namely, the loss of fiduciary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in general. From this point of view we get a <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> explanation of numerous objectionable passages in <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> writings, against which even <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> with deep moral sense, such as Hugo Grotius and George <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, earnestly protested. Thus we find in one of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> letters, written to <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melancthon</a> in 1521, the following sentence: "Be a sinner and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> boldly, but believe and rejoice in Christ more strongly, who triumphed over <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, death, and the world; as long as we live here, we must <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." Could anyone do more to degrade <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> concept of justification than <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> did in the following <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>: "If <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> could be committed in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it would not be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>"? (Cf. M&ouml;hler, "Symbolik", sec. 16). The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of justification by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone was considered by <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and his followers as an incontrovertible <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, as the foundation rock of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, as an "article by which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must stand or fall" (<em>articulus stantis et cadentis ecclesia</em>), and which of itself would have been a sufficient cause for beginning the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, as the Smalkaldic Articles emphatically declare. Thus we need not wonder when later on we see <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> declaring that the <em>Sola-Fides</em> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, as the <em>principium materiale</em> of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, deserves to be placed side by side with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <em>Sola-Scriptura</em> ("Bible alone", with the exclusion of Tradition) as its <em>principium formale</em> &#151; two maxims in which the contrast between <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> reaches its highest point. Since, however, neither maxim can be found in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, every <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> is forced to conclude that <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> from its very beginning and foundation is based on self-deception. We assert this of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in general; for the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of justification as defended by the reformed Churches differs only in non-essentials from <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. The most important of these differences is to be found in <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> system, which taught that only such as are <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> infallibly to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> obtain justification, whilst in those not <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> produces a mere appearance of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and righteousness, and this in order to punish them the more severely in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> (Cf. M&ouml;hler, "Symbolik", sec.12).

<p>From what has been said it is obvious that justification as understood by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, presents the following qualities: its absolute <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> (<em>certitudo</em>), its equality in all (<em>aequalitas</em>), and finally the impossibility of ever losing it (<em>inamissibilitas</em>). For if it be essential to fiduciary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that it infallibly assures the sinner of his own justification, it cannot mean anything but a firm conviction of the actual possession of grace. If, moreover, the sinner be justified, not by an interior righteousness capable of increase or decrease, but through <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> the same, it is evident that all the just from the common mortal to the Apostles and the Blessed Virgin Mary possess one and the same degree of righteousness and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. Finally if, as <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> maintains, only the loss of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (according to <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, not even that) can deprive us of justification, it follows that justification once obtained can never be lost.

<p>Incidentally, we may here call attention to another significant fact, namely that it was <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> who laid the foundation for the separation of religion and morality. For, by stating that fiduciary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone suffices for obtaining both justification and eternal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, he minimized our moral faculties to such an extent that charity and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> no longer affect our relations with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. By this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> opened a fundamental breach between religion and morality, between <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and law, and assigned to each its own distinct sphere of action in which each can attain its end independent of the other. Prof. Paulsen of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> was therefore justified in eulogizing <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, who followed <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> in this matter, as the Philosopher of Protestantism". (Cf. M&ouml;hler, "Symbolik", sec. 25.)

<p>The harshness, want of harmony, intrinsic improbability, and contradiction of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> contained in the system soon brought about a reaction in the very midst of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. Osiander (d. 1552), at once an enthusiastic admirer of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and an independent thinker, emphatically stated (in opposition to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>) that the justifying power of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> consists in a real, instrinsic union of Christ with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, an opinion for which, as <em>being <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a></em>, he was censured freely. <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Butzer</a> (d. 1551) likewise admits, in addition to an "imputed exterior righteousness", the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of an "inherent righteousness" as a partial factor in justification, thus meeting <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> half way. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> most dangerous adversary, however, was his friend <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melancthon</a>, who, in his praiseworthy endeavour to smooth over by conciliatory modifications the interior difficulties of this discordant system, laid the foundation for the famous <em>Synergisten-Streit</em> (Synergist Dispute), which was so soon to become embittered. In general it was precisely the denial of man's <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> in the moral order, and of the impossibility of his full cooperation with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> that repelled so many followers of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. No sooner had Pfeffinger in his book, "De libero arbitrio" (Leipzig, 1555) taken up defence of man's <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> than many <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of Jena (e.g. Strigel) boldly attacked the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <em>Klotz-Stock-und-Steintheorie</em> (log-stick-and-stone theory), and tried to force from their adversaries the concession that man can cooperate with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> grace. The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> quarrel soon <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> very annoying to both parties and the desire for peace became universal. "The Half-Melanchtonians" had succeeded in smuggling Synergism into the "Book of Torgau" (1576); but before the "Formulary of Concord" was printed in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/16009b.htm">Bergen</a> (near <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, 1557), the article in question was eliminated as heterodox and the harsh <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> substituted in the symbols of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran Church</a>. The new breach in the system by the Synergisten-Streit was enlarged by a counter movement that originated among the <a href="../cathen/12080c.htm">Pietists</a> and <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodists</a>, who were willing to admit the fallible assurance of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> &#151; given by fiduciary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> &#151; only in case that that assurance was confirmed by internal experience. But what probably contributed most of all to the crumbling of the system was the rapid growth of <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinianism</a> and <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> which during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries gained so many adherents among the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>. Fiduciary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was no longer considered a spiritual means to assist man in reaching out for the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but was identified with a disposition which is upright and pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Latterly, A. <a href="../cathen/13086a.htm">Ritschl</a> defined justification as the change in the consciousness of our relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and amplified this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> by the statement that the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is further determined by the consciousness of our union with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community. Schleiermacher and Hengstenberg deviated still further from the old <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. For they declared contrition and penance as also <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for justification, thus "coming dangerously near the Catholic system", as Derner expresses it ("Geschichte der protest. Theologie", <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1867, p. 583). Finally the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> Church of Scandinavia has in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> experienced a "quiet reformation", inasmuch as it now, without being fully conscious of the fact, defends the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> on justification (cf. Krogh-Tonning, "Die Gnadenlehre und die stille Reformation", Christiania, 1894). The strict <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of the Old Lutherans, e.g. in the Kingdom of Saxony and the <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">State of Missouri</a>, alone continues to cling tenaciously to a system, which otherwise would have slowly fallen into oblivion.
<h2 id="section1">The Catholic doctrine on justification</h2>

<p>We have an authentic explanation of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> in the famous "Decretum de justificatione" of the Sixth Session (13 Jan., 1547) of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, which in sixteen chapters (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, "Enchir.", nn.793-810) and thirty-three canons (l.c., 811-43) gives in the clearest manner all <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> information about the process, causes, effects, and qualities of justification.
<h3 id="A">The process of justification (<em>processus justificationis</em>)</h3>

<p>Since justification as an application of the Redemption to the individual presupposes the fall of the entire <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">human race</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> quite <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> begins with the fundamental statement that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> has weakened and deflected, but not entirely destroyed or extinguished the freedom of the human will (Trent, sess. VI, cap. i: "Liberum arbitrium minime extinctum, viribus licet attenuatum et inclinatum"). Nevertheless, as the children of Adam were really corrupted by <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, they could not of themselves arise from their fall nor shake off the bonds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, death, and <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. Neither the natural faculties left in man, nor the observance of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish Law</a> could achieve this. Since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone was able to free us from this great misery, He sent in His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> His only begotten Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, Who by His bitter passion and death on the cross redeemed fallen man and thus became the Mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man. But if the grace of Redemption merited by Christ is to be appropriated by the individual, he must be "regenerated by God", that is he must be justified. What then is meant by justification? Justification denotes that change or transformation in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by which man is transferred from the state of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, in which as a child of Adam he was born, to that of grace and Divine sonship through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the second Adam, our Redeemer (l.c., cap.iv: "Justificatio impii. . . translatio ab eo statu, in quo homo nascitur filius primi Adae, in statum gratiae et adoptionis filiorum Dei per secundum Adam, Jesum Christum, Salvatorem nostrum"). In the New Law this justification cannot, according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> precept, be effected except at the fountain of regeneration, that is, by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of water. While in Baptism infants are forthwith cleansed of the stain of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> without any preparation on their part, the adult must pass through a moral preparation, which consists essentially in turning from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This entire process receives its first impulse from the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> grace of vocation (absolutely independent of man's merits), and requires an intrinsic union of the Divine and human action, of grace and moral freedom of election, in such a manner, however, that the will can resist, and with full liberty reject the influence of grace (Trent, l.c., can.iv: "If any one should say that <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, moved and set in action by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, cannot cooperate by assenting to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> call, nor dissent if it wish. . . let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>"). By this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> the Council not only condemned the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> view that the will in the reception of grace remains merely passive, but also forestalled the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic heresy</a> regarding the impossibility of resisting <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual grace</a>. With what little right <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in defence of their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> appeal to St. Augustine, may be seen from the following brief extract from his writings: "He who made you without your doing does not without your action justify you. Without your knowing He made you, with your willing He justifies you, but it is He who justifies, that the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> be not your own" (Serm. clxix, c. xi, n.13). Regarding St. Augustine's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> cf. J. Jausbach, "Die Ethik des hl. Augustinus", II, Freiburg, 1909, pp. 208-58.

<p>We now come to the different states in the process of justification. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> assigns the first and most important place to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is styled "the beginning, foundation and root of all justification" (Trent, l.c., cap.viii). Cardinal Pallavicini* (Hist. Conc. Trid., VIII, iv, 18) tells us that all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present at the council fully realized how important it was to explain <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> saying that man is justified through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Comparing Bible and Tradition they could not experience any serious difficulty in showing that fiduciary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was an absolutely new invention and that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of justification was identical with a firm <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> and promises of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a> (l. c.: "illumque [Deum] tanquam omnis justitiae fontem diligere incipiunt"). The next step is a genuine sorrow for all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with the resolution to begin a new life by receiving <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and by observing the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The process of justification is then brought to a close by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of water, inasmuch as by the grace of this sacrament the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> is freed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (original and personal) and its punishments, and is made a child of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The same process of justification is repeated in those who by mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> have lost their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> innocence; with this modification, however, that the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a> replaces <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Considering merely the <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> analysis of the conversion of sinners, as given by the council, it is at once evident that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, whether fiduciary or dogmatic, cannot justify man (Trent, l. c., can. xii: "Si quis dixerit, fidem justificantem nihil aliud esse quam fiduciam divinae misericordiae, peccata remittentis propter Christum, vel eam fiduciam solam esse, qua justificamur, a.s."). Since our Divine adoption and friendship with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is based on perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or charity (cf. <a href="../bible/gal005.htm#vrs6">Galatians 5:6</a>; <a href="../bible/1co013.htm">1 Corinthians 13</a>; <a href="../bible/jam002.htm#vrs17">James 2:17 sqq.</a>), dead <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> devoid of charity (<em>fides informis</em>) cannot possess any justifying power. Only such <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as is active in charity and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> (<em>fides caritate formata</em>) can justify man, and this even before the actual reception of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> or penance, although not without a desire of the sacrament (cf. Trent, Sess. VI, cap. iv, xiv). But, not to close the gates of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> against <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and those non-Catholics, who without their fault do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> or do not recognize the Sacraments of Baptism and Penance, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> unanimously hold that the desire to receive these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is implicitly contained in the serious resolve to do all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has commanded, even if His holy will should not become known in every detail.
<h3 id="B">The formal cause of justification</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> decreed that the essence of active justification comprises not only forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also "sanctification and renovation of the interior man by means of the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> acceptation of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> and other <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">supernatural gifts</a>" (Trent, l. c., cap. vii: "Non est sola peccatorum remissio, sed et sanctificatio et renovatio interioris hominis per voluntariam susceptionem gratiae et donorum"). In order to exclude the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a merely forensic <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> and exterior declaration of righteousness, special stress is laid on the fact that we are justified by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, not that whereby He himself is just but that whereby He makes us just, in so far as He bestows on us the gift of His grace which renovates the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> interiorly and adheres to it as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> own <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> (Trent, l. c., cap. vii: "Unica formalis causa [justificationis] est justitia Dei, non qua ipse justus est, sed qua nos justos facit, qua videlicet ab eo donati, renovamur spiritu mentis nostrae: et non modo reputamur, sed vere justi nominamur et sumus, justitiam in nobis recipientes unusquisque suam"). This inner quality of righteousness and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> is universally termed "sanctifying (or habitual) grace", and stands in marked contrast to an exterior, imputed <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, as well as to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of merely covering and concealing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. By this, however, we do not assert that the "justitia Dei extra nos" is of no importance in the process of justification. For, even if it is not the formal cause of justification (<em>causa formalis</em>), it is nevertheless its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> exemplar (<em>causa exemplaris</em>), inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> receives a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> in imitation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> own <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (l. c. cap. vii), moreover, did not neglect to enumerate in detail the other causes of justification: the glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of Christ as the final cause (<em>causa finalis</em>), the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the efficient cause (<em>causa efficiens</em>), the Passion of Christ as the meritorious cause (<em>causa meritoria</em>), the reception of the Sacraments as the instrumental cause (<em>causa instrumentalis</em>). Thus each and every factor receives its full share and is assigned its proper place. Hence the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> on justification, in welcome contrast to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> teaching, stands out as a reasonable, consistent, harmonious system. For further explanation of the nature of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, see <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">SUPERNATURAL GRACE</a>. Regarding the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">Hermes</a>, cf. <a href="../cathen/08667a.htm">Kleutgen</a>, "Theologie der Vorzeit", II (2nd ed., Munster, 1872), 254-343.

<p>According to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is not merely <em>a</em> formal cause, but "<em>the only</em> formal cause" (<em>unica causa formalis</em>) of our justification. By this important decision the Council excluded the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Butzer</a> and some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> (<a href="../cathen/07036b.htm">Gropper</a>, Scripando, and <a href="../cathen/12082a.htm">Albert Pighius</a>) who maintained that an additional "external favour of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<em>favor Dei externus</em>) belonged to the essence of justification. The same <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> also effectually set aside the opinion of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, that the formal cause of justification (i.e. <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>) is nothing less than the <em>Person</em> of the Holy Ghost, Who is the hypostatic <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and charity, or the uncreated grace (<em>gratia increata</em>). Since justification consists in an interior <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and renovation of spirit, its formal cause evidently must be a created grace (<em>gratia creata</em>), a permanent quality, a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> modification or accident (<em>accidens</em>) of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Quite distinct from this is the question whether the personal indwelling of the Holy Ghost, although not required for justification (inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> alone suffices), be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as a prerequisite for Divine adoption. Several great <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> have answered in the affirmative, as for instance <a href="../cathen/09192a.htm">Lessius</a> ("De summo bono", II, i; "De perfect. moribusque divin.", XII, ii); <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a> ("De Trinit.", viii, 4 sqq.); <a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassin</a> ("De Trinit.", viii, 9 sqq.), and <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a> ("Compend. theol. dogmat.", III, 6th ed., pp. 162 sqq.). The solution of the lively controversy on this point between <a href="../cathen/06725a.htm">Fr. Granderath</a> ("Zeitschrift fur katholische Theologie", 1881, pp. 283 sqq.; 1883, 491 sqq., 593 sqq.; 1884, 545 sqq.) and <a href="../cathen/13525b.htm">Professor Scheeben</a> ("Dogmatik", II, sec. 169; "Katholik", 1883, I, 142 sqq.; II, 561 sqq.; 1884, I, 18 sqq.; II, 465 sqq., 610 sqq.) seems to lie in the following distinction: the Divine adoption, inseparably connected with <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, is not constituted by the personal indwelling of the Holy Ghost, but receives therefrom its full development and perfection.
<h3 id="C">The effects of justification</h3>

<p>The two elements of active justification, forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and sanctification, furnish at the same time the elements of habitual justification, freedom from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. According to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, however, this freedom from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> are effected, not by two distinct and successive Divine acts, but by a single act of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For, just as light dispels darkness, so the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> <em>eo ipso</em> dispels from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> original and mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. (Cf. Trent, sess. VI, can. xi: "Si quis dixerit, homines justificari vel sola imputatione justitiae Christi, vel sola peccatorum remissione, exclusa gratia et caritate, quae in cordibus eorum per Spiritum Sanctum diffundatur atque illis inhaereat. . ., a.s.") In considering the effects of justification it will be useful to compare the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> of real forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> theory that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is merely "covered" and not imputed. By declaring the grace of justification, or <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, to be the only formal cause of justification, the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> intended to emphasize the fact that in possessing <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> we possess the whole essence of the state of justification with all its formal effects; that is, we possess freedom from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, and indeed freedom from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <em>by means</em> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. Such a remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> could not consist in a mere covering or non-imputation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which continue their existence out of view; it must necessarily consist in the real obliteration and annihilation of the guilt. This genuinely Biblical concept of justification forms such an essential element of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, that even <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Antonio Rosmini's</a> theory, standing half way between <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, is quite irreconcilable with it. According to <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a>, there are two categories of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: <ul> <li>such as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> merely covers and does not impute (cf. <a href="../bible/psa031.htm#vrs1">Psalm 31:1</a>); <li>such as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> really forgives and blots out. </ul> By the latter <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a> understood deliberate <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of commission (<em>culpae actuales et liberae</em>), by the former indeliberate <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (<em>peccata non libera</em>), which "do no harm to those who are of the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". This opinion was censured by the Holy Office (14 Dec., 1887), not only because without any reason it defended a twofold remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also because it stamped indeliberate acts as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, "Enchir.", n.1925).

<p>Although it is a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> that <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (original and mortal) do never exist simultaneously in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, there may be, nevertheless a diversity of opinion regarding the extent of this incompatibility, according as it is considered as either moral, physical, or metaphysical in character. According to the now universally rejected opinion of the <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a> (Occam, Gabriel Biel) and the <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotists</a> (<a href="../cathen/10040a.htm">Mastrius</a>, Henno) the contrast between grace and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is based on a free <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> and acceptation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or in other words, the contrast is merely moral. This would <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> imply in contradiction to the "unica causa formalis" of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, a twofold formal cause of justification (cf. Pohle, "Dogmatik", II, 4th ed., Paderborn, 1909, p. 512). Francisco Su&aacute;rez (De gratia, VII, 20) and some of his followers in defending a physical contrast come nearer the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. In their explanation grace and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> exclude each other with the same necessity as do fire and water, although in both cases <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of his <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>, could suspend the general law and force the two hostile elements to exist peacefully side by side. This opinion might be safely accepted were <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> only a physical ornament of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But since in reality it is an <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> form of sanctification by which even an infant in receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is necessarily made just and pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there must be between the concepts of grace and of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> a metaphysical and absolute contradiction, which not even Divine <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a> can alter and destroy. For this last opinion, defended by the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> and the majority of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, there is also a solid foundation in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. For the contrast between grace and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is as great as between light and darkness (<a href="../bible/2co006.htm#vrs14">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>; <a href="../bible/eph005.htm#vrs8">Ephesians 5:8</a>), between life and death (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs21">Romans 5:21</a>; <a href="../bible/col002.htm#vrs13">Colossians 2:13</a>; <a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#vrs14">1 John 3:14</a>), between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and idols, Christ and <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a> (<a href="../bible/2co006.htm#vrs15">2 Corinthians 6:15 sqq.</a>), etc. Thus it follows from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> that by the infusion of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is destroyed and blotted out of absolute necessity, and that the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> theory of "covering and not imputing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" is both a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> impossibility. Besides the principal effect of justification, i.e. real obliteration of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by means of sanctification, there is a whole series of other effects: beauty of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, friendship with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Divine adoption. In the article on <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">GRACE</a> these are described as formal effects of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. In the same article is given an explanation of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> accompaniments &#151; the three <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> virtues, the moral virtues, the seven gifts, and the personal indwelling of the Holy Ghost. These, as freely bestowed gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, cannot be regarded as formal effects of justification.
<h3 id="D">The qualities of justification</h3>

<p>We have seen that <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> claim the following three qualities for justification: <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, equality, the impossibility of ever losing it. Diametrically opposed to these qualities are those defended by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (sess. VI, cap. 9-11): uncertainty (<em>incertitudo</em>), inequality (<em>inaequalitas</em>), amissibility (<em>ammisibilitas</em>). Since these qualities of justification are also qualities of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, see <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">GRACE</a>.
