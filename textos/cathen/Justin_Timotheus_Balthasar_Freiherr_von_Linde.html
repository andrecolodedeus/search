<h1>Justin Timotheus Balthasar, Freiherr von Linde</h1>  

<p>Hessian jurist and stateman, b. in the village of Brilon, <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, 7 Aug., 1797; d. at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a> during the night of 8-9 June, 1870. His father, who was barrister, died when Justin was only three years old; this occurrence, and the fact that the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> had to support four children in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> times, darkened in a measure the youth of the unusually talented boy. After he had completed his gymnasium studies at Arnsber (1816), he devoted himself with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and success to the study of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of Munster, Gottingen, and Bonn. In the last-mentioned he received the doctorate (1820), and qualified in 1821 as <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> tutor. Two years later he was called to Giessen, where, as extraordinary (1823), and subsequently as ordinary professor of law (1824-9) attracted numbers of students, and became distinguished through his learned publications. In 1829 he was called to Darmstadt, as ministerial counsel (<em>Ministerialrat</em>), and was later (1832) named director of Board of Education. The year 1833 found him Chancellor of the University of Giessen. Soon after (1836) he was named privy councillor, and 1839 brought a patent of nobility. After repeated requests, he was permitted to retire with a pension in 1847. In 1848 he was a member of the Frankfort Parliament and in 1850 of the Parliament of Erfurt, and from the latter year he acted as Prince Lichtenstein's ambassador to German Diet &mdash; from 1863 he also represented the elder line of <a href="../cathen/12799b.htm">Reuss</a> and Hesse-Homburg &mdash; until its dissolution in 1866. The wreck of his political ideals, espoused by him with great warmth, was not without effect upon Linde's mind and temper. His former most inexhaustible capacity for work was broken, as well as his wonderful <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">cheerfulness</a>. He withdrew most entirely to his country seat, Dreys, and during a visit to one of his sons at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a> he was carried away by a stroke of apoplexy in 1870.

<p>In his younger days he was, in politics, friendly to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> (cf. his "Rede uber den Geburtstag des Konigs von Preussen", Soest, 1816), and in religion somewhat Josephinistic. Gradually, however, he developed into a strong particularist, as well as a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> champion of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and claims of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, although he did not succeed in winning the entire confidence of the strict <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party. To Linde is due the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty in the University of Giessen, in which many excellent men laboured &mdash; among others the well-known <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical historian</a> <a href="../cathen/13054c.htm">Riffel</a>, who later quarrelled with Linde. For the erection of a church in the same place especial thanks are due to him. His <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> is unquestionable. Linde's numerous official reports have still to be collected from the archives; most of his pamphlets are forgotten, although many are of permanent value. The best collection of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> productions is given by Schulte in the "Allgemeine deutsche Biographie", s.v. "Linde" (XVIII, 671). The most important and extensive of these works are: "Abhandlungen aus dem Civilprozess" (2 vols., Bonn, 1823-9); "Lehrbuch des deutschen gemeinen Civilprozesses" (7th ed., Bonn, 1850); "Archiv fur das &ouml;ffentliche Recht des deutschen Bundes" (4 vols., Giessen, 1850-63).
