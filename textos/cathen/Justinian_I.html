<h1>Justinian I</h1>  

<p>Roman Emperor (527-65)</p>

<p>Flavius Anicius Julianus Justinianus was born about 483 at Tauresium (Taor) in Illyricum (near Uskup); d. 565. The theory that he was a <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> by race is now abandoned (Krumbacher, "Byz. Litt.", 237). He was the nephew of Justin I (518-27), being the son of Justin's sister Vigilantia and a certain Sabatius. Already during his uncle's reign he became the chief power in the state. Justin was an old man, weak in body and mind; he gradually handed over all power to his nephew. In 521 Justinian was proclaimed consul, then general-in-chief, and in April, 527, Augustus; in August of the same year Justin died, and Justinian was left sole ruler.

<p>The thirty-eight years of Justinian's reign are the most brilliant period of the later empire. Full of enthusiasm for the memories of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he set himself, and achieved, the task of reviving their glory. The many-sided activity of this wonderful man may be summed up under the headings: military triumphs, legal work, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> polity, and <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> activity. Dominating all is the policy of restoring the empire, great, powerful, and united. Of these many features of his reign &#151; each of them epoch-making &#151; it is impossible to give more than the merest outline here.
<h2 id="section1">Military triumphs</h2>

<p>Justinian carried on the unending <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> with mixed success. His general Belisarius lost a battle at first in 528, then completely routed the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> at Daras, near Nisibis (June, 530); but on 19 April, 531, the Romans were defeated near Callinicum on the Euphrates; in September a peace was arranged on fairly equal terms. The emperor then conceived the plan of reconquering Africa and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, lost to the empire by the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandal</a> and <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Gothic</a> invasions. In 533 a fleet of five hundred ships set sail for Africa under Belisarius. In two battles the Romans annihilated the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandal kingdom</a>, took the king, Gelimer, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to Constantinople, and re-estabished the authority of Caesar in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. In 535 Belisarius sailed for <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. The island was conquered at once. After a reverse in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> that province was also subdued. Belisarius in 536 took Rhegium and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in triumph, seized <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, sustained a siege in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> till 538, when the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> retired. A second general, Narses, then arrived with reinforcements from Constantinople; <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and all Liguria were taken in 539, and in 540 all <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> up to the frontier of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Kingdom was reunited to the empire. In 542 the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> revolted under their king, Totila; by 553 they were again crushed. Narses became the first Exarch of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> and Brixia (Brescia), the last Gothic strongholds, fell in 562. The Roman armies then marched on <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and conquered its south-eastern provinces (lost again in 623, after Justinian's death.) Meanwhile the Crimean <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> and all the Bosporus, even the Southern <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, were forced to acknowledge the rule of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. A second <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> (540-45) pushed the Roman frontier beyond <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>. From 549 to 556 a long in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> and Colchis (the Lazic War) again established the empire without a rival on the shores of the Black Sea. So Justinian ruled once more over a colossal world empire, whose extent rivaled that of the great days before <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>. Meanwhile the emperor was no less successful at home. In 532 a very dangerous revolt (the Nika revolution), that arose from the factions of the Circus (the Blues and Greens), was put down severely. Bury says that the result of the suppression was "an imperial victory which established the form of absolutism by which Byzantine history is generally characterized". (Later Roman Empire, I, 345).
<h2 id="section2">Legal work</h2>

<p>The most enduring work of Justinian was his codification of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. This, too, was an important part of his general scheme. The great empire he was reconquering must have the strength of organized unity. He says in the edict of <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that a state rests on arms and law ("De Justin. Cod. Confirmando", printed in front of the codex). The scattered decrees of his predecessors must then be collected in a well-ordered and complete codex, <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> arranged, so that every Roman citizen could learn at once the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the empire on any subject. This codification was Justinian's great work. He made many new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> himself, but his enduring merit is rather the classification of scattered older <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. The legislation that the world owes to Justinian is in outline this:

<ul> <li>First, a commission of ten lawyers (including the famous Tribonianus and Theophilus) reduced the bulky and rambling Theodosian Code (published in 438) to an orderly compendium, inserting into it the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> made since it was written. So the "Codex" was produced in 529. <li>Second, a mass of answers given by authorities (the <em>responsa prudentum</em> that formed acknowledged precedents) were arranged (omitting all superfluities) in fifty books, whereby a law <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of a hundred and six volumes was reduced to about one-fifth. This is the "Digest", or <a href="../cathen/11439a.htm">"Pandects"</a>, published in 530. <li>Third, a manual of law for students was compiled from the commentaries of Gaius (second century). This, the "Institutes", was published in the same year, 530. <li>In 534, finally, the whole work was revised, and a fourth part, the "Authentic", or "Novels", was added, containing later decisions made by Justinian's own courts. </ul>

<p>So the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> "Corpus Juris Civilis" was produced, consisting of four parts: (a) <em>Digestae seu Pondecta</em>, (b) <em>Institutiones</em>, (c) <em>Codex</em>, (d) <em>Authenticum seu Novellae</em> (an excellent account of its composition is found in Bury's Gibbon, ed. Cit., IV 461-510). It would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of this "Corpus". It is the basis of all canon law (<em>ecclesia vivit lege romana</em>), and the basis of <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> in every civilized country.
<h2 id="section3">Ecclesiastical polity</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cannot applaud the great emperor's <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> polity, though in this, too, we recognize the statesman's effort to promote peace and union within the empire. It was a matter of course that this union was to be that of the "most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>" (5 c., De s. tr., I, 1). The Corpus Juris is full of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> (apostasy was punished by death, 10 c., "De pag.", I, 11), <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> (who began a dangerous revolt in 529), <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. The decrees of the four <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a> were incorporated in the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. There was no toleration of dissent. True to the ideal of Constantinople, the emperor conceived himself as "priest and king", supreme head on earth in matters <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> as well as in the State. He filled his codex with canon law and assumed the most outspoken <a href="../cathen/05514a.htm">Erastianism</a> as the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the empire. And all through his reign he fell foul of the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by his attempts to conciliate the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>. Ever since Chalcedon (451) these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> filled <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and were a constant source of disunion and trouble to the empire. Justinian was one of the many emperors who tried to reconcile them by concessions. His wife Theodora was a secret <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>; influenced by her, the emperor, while maintaining Chalcedon, tried to satisfy the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> by various compromises. First came the Theopaschite question. Peter Fullo of Antioch had introduced into the Trisagion the clause: "Who didst suffer for us". Pope Hormisdas (514-23) refused to admit it, as savoring of <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>. But Justinian approved it and promoted a <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>, Anthimus I (536), to the See of Constantinople. Then followed the great quarrel of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, the lamentable attitude of <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a> (540-55), and the <a href="../cathen/04308b.htm">Second Council of Constantinople</a> (553). In all thus story Justinian appears as a persecutor of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and takes his place, unhappily, among the semi-Monophysite tyrants who caused the long series of quarrels and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a> that were the after-effect of <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>. His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tyranny is the one regrettable side of the character of so great a man.
<h2 id="section4">Architectural activity</h2>

<p>Justinian also acquired <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> fame by the impetus he gave to the arts. If any style can ever be ascribed to one man, what we call <a href="../cathen/03094a.htm">Byzantine architecture</a>, at least in its perfect form, owes its origin to Justinian and the architects he employed. His activity in building was prodigious. He covered his empire from <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> to Damascus with superb monuments. All later building in East and West was derived from his models; two most famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, our <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> (Gothic) and the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> styles, are the lineal descendants of Justinian's architecture. Of his many buildings may be mentioned the two most famous, the church of Our Lady (now the El-Aqsa mosque) at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and, by far the most splendid of all, the great church of the Holy Wisdom (Hagia Sophia) at Constantinople. This church especially, built by Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of <a href="../cathen/10303c.htm">Miletus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 27 December, 537, remains always one of the chief monuments of architecture in the world.

<p>Naturally these great enterprises demanded great expense. Justinian's subjects frequently complained of the heavy taxes; many people in the lands he conquered back thought that the glory of being once more Roman citizens was bought too dearly when they realized how much they had to pay to the Roman exchequer. On the other hand, Justinian spent magnificently. In times of calamity, earthquake and famine, the imperial purse was opened to the sufferers with unlimited generosity.

<p>The emperor's private life is somewhat clouded by the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a> told of his wife, Theodora. She had been a dancing-girl; there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that she had led an immoral life before her marriage in 523. She was also a <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>. But most scholars now reject the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> account of her married life given by Procopius in his "Secret History". And in January, 532, at the time of the Circus revolution that nearly wrecked the state, it was Theodora's <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and presence of mind that saved the situation. For the rest she had a hand in all her husband's policy; administration, diplomacy, church affairs, etc., felt her influence for twenty-one years. If she did not dishonor Justinian by infidelity she certainly led him into semi-Monophysitism (see Diehl, Theodora, imperatrice de Byzance," <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1904).

<p>Justinian died in November, 565 (succeeded by his nephew, Justin II, 565-78). He was undoubtedly the greatest emperor after Constantine, perhaps the greatest of all the long line of Roman Caesars. Indeed one may question whether any state can show in its history so magnificent a ruler. His glorious memory lasted through all the ages after him (see <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, "Paradiso", vi,) and his portrait gleams still from the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> in S. Vitale at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, where he stands in his toga and diadem, surrounded by his court, with a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at his side the very type of the majesty of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the Bosporus.
