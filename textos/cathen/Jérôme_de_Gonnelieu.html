<h1>J&eacute;r&ocirc;me de Gonnelieu</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a>, <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> writer, and preacher; born at <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, 8 Sept., 1640; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 28 Feb., 1715. At the age of seventeen he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> (4 Oct, 1657). Till the year 1674, when he pronounced his final <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, his services were requisitioned in various capacities, his work as a teacher being particularly efficient and valuable. From this date his abilities were long and actively directed toward the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, and many, attracted by the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of learning of his discourse, looked to him as spiritual consoler and adviser. He attained to considerable repute as a sacred orator, the qualifications which he possessed in this way being altogether exceptional and peculiar; he had particularly, in a marked degree, the faculty of conveying spiritual thoughts of the loftiest and noblest import in a form that was readily assimilable by the people. His <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, of whatever order, were discharged with thoroughness and a laudable spirit of self-sacrifice; the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and earnestness which he always displayed in the cause of religion entitle Gonnelieu to a very high place among the evangelical workers of that time who laboured most to advancement of men. Toward the latter end of his life he gave himself up almost exclusively to literary activity; and the renown which he acquired in this department was no less deserved than the celebrity with which his preaching was attended. The following is a list of his works: "Exercise de la vie spirituelle" (Paris, 1701); "De la Pr&eacute;sence de Dieu qui renferme tous les principes de la vie int&eacute;rieure" (partis, 1703, 1709; Marseilles, 1827); "M&eacute;thode de bien prier" (Paris, 1710, 1769); "Pratique de la vie int&eacute;rieure", etc. (Paris, 1710); "Instruction sur la Confession et la Communion" (Paris, 1710; printed with preceding work in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> edition of 1713): "Sermon de Norte Seigneur &agrave; ses ap&ocirc;tres apr&eacute;s la C&eacute;ne, avec des r&eacute;flections" (Paris, 1712); "Nouvelle retaite de huit jours &agrave; l'usage des personnes de monde et du clo&icirc;tre" (Paris, 1736).

<p>To the above, almost all the biographies add another work, of which the full title is "L'Imitation de Jesus-Christ, Traduction nouvelle: Avec une Pratique et une Pi&eacute;re &agrave; la fin de chaque Chapitre" (Par. le R. P. de Gonnelieu, de la Compagnie de J&eacute;sus, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Nancy, 1712); but a great majority of the bibliographies too, of somewhat arbitrarily, deny that <em>Traduction</em> (translation), as distinct from the <em>secours</em> (helps) at the end of each chapter, is by de Gonnelieu. the opinion of the negative critics seems to be based mainly on the statement of <a href="../cathen/03189a.htm">Calmet</a> (op. cit. below), that "the translation is by John-Baptiste Cusson [printer at <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>], and the rest by P. Gonnelieu". the most approved form of this theory is that which attributes the rendering, as made originally, to Jean Cusson, printer at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and clerk to the Parliament, who, in his version published in 1673, had availed himself largely of the celebrated translation by Sacy. John-Baptiste Cusson, a man of culture and fine literary sense, after thoroughly revising and improving his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> work, had issued the amended version at <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a> in 1712. Gence, author of a notice on the principle French translations of "Imitation" (Journal des cur&eacute;s, Sept. 1810), substantially maintained this view; see also Barbier and Brunet (op cit, below). The "Journal des S&ccedil;avans" on the other hand, in a review written within one year after the publication of the work, whilst praising the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the translator, says expressly that the version is by P. Gonnelieu; and adds that "Sieur Cusson (one time printer of the Journal) has enriched this first edition by many copper-plates". The testimony of the "M&eacute;moirs de Tr&eacute;voux" (see below) for August, 1713, is almost identical with the preceding; and in the same notice it is stated that "the name of P. de Gonnelieu was a 'pr&eacute;jug&eacute; infallible' in favour of the excellence of the work". Finally, if it be argued, with those who deny the Gonnelieu authorship of the rendering that the title of the "Traduction" is misleading, is it not more natural to assume that the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Senones, in his "Historie des hommes illustres", written almost fifty years after the appearance of the version, was deceived by the ambiguity, than to assert such <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> on the part of those who were on terms of intimate relationship with Cusson, the printer, and Gonnelieu, the presumptive author?
