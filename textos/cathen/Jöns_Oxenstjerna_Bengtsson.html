<h1>J&ouml;ns Oxenstjerna Bengtsson</h1>  

<p>(JOANNES BENEDICTI).

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15207a.htm">Upsala</a>, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, b. 1417; d. in 1467. He was a member of the illustrious Oxenstjerna <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, various representatives of which had already become prominent in the public life of <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>. At the time of his appointment to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishopric</a> (1448) Bengtsson was <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> of the chapter of Upsala. He asked the Council of Basle for a confirmation of his election, and he had himself <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> (30 June, 1448) by his suffragans, the day after they had <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Karl Knutsson Bonde as King. On 1 July, Archbishop Bengtsson <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> the queen. The confirmation of his appointment by <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Pope Nicholas V</a> did not reach him until the ensuing year.

<p>The importance of Archbishop Bengtsson is political rather than <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, though his pastoral visitations show that he was not unmindful of the spiritual welfare of those under his care. In 1457, as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15207a.htm">Upsala</a>, he received from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the title of <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Sweden; the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Lund</a>, however, were permitted to retain their title of <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Sweden. The life of Archbishop Bengtsson fell in Sweden's most troublous days. By the Union of Calmar (1397) the three kingdoms of <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, while preserving their individual independence, were to be ruled by one king, and the foreign affairs of all three were to be regulated as those of a united country. The advantages of this union were lost sight of on the death of its promoter, Queen Margaret (1412). Her successor Erik of <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a>, by a change of policy, aroused in Sweden a spirit of discontent, which, after successive revolutions and the election of Karl Knutsson as viceroy (1438), resulted in the deposing of Erik. His successor, Christopher of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, died in 1448. In Sweden, which was torn by the strife between the partisans of a national kingdom and those of a government in union with <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, the national party elected Karl Knutsson king. A few months later Christian I became King of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, and two years afterwards also King of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>. Meanwhile, dissensions increased in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>. As King Karl Knutsson, to escape from money troubles, increased taxes and confiscated <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, dissatisfaction spread among <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people, and Archbishop Bengtsson placed himself at the head of the opposition (1457). Entering his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, he laid aside his pontifical insignia, took up helmet, breastplate, and sword, and announced his intention not to resume his pontifical robes until Karl Knutsson should be banished from the country. Knutsson was forced to yield and fled to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Thereupon Christian I came from <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and was formally recognized King of Sweden, and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> at <a href="../cathen/14297a.htm">Stockholm</a> by Archbishop Bengtsson.

<p>General discontent soon followed, especially when Christian I, on becoming heir to his uncle, Duke Adolph of Holstein, found himself in great financial straits. To meet his <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>, he levied enormous taxes, even in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, without exempting <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, religious foundations, or the moneys collected by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> mandate to defray the expenses of a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. During a temporary absence of Christian I in <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> held the regency of <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>; seeing the people in revolt against him and the heavy imposts, he took up their cause and suspended the collection of taxes. The king showed his displeasure by arresting the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and sending him to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. A revolution broke out afresh in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, Karl Knutsson was recalled to the throne, and Christian I, to recover the country, became reconciled with his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. Bengtsson went at once to <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, where he roused the people against King Karl Knutsson, whom he <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> succeeded finally in bringing about Knutsson's abdication, and the recognition of Christian I once more as King of Sweden. In reality however, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> held the reins of power and administered affairs as though he were the actual sovereign. He was unable to sustain this r&ocirc;le. Discontented factions combined against him and, in 1466, elected Erik Axelsson Thott as regent, whereupon Archbishop Bengtsson was compelled to retire. Dissensions continued, and the king of the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> party, Knutsson, once more took the place of the king who represented the union of the three countries. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> found an asylum with his friend Magnus Gren, on the island of &OElig;land, where he died 15 December, 1467, "poor and exiled, regretted by no one, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by many, and feared by all".

<p>The key to the political activity of Bengtsson is to be found in the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> that was a part of his character &mdash; <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> for his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and his country. There was a strong antagonism between the great Oxenstjerna <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, to which the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> belonged, and the Bonde <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, of which the king, supported by the national party, was member. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was aware that the nobility and the leading men of Sweden, before the Union of Calmar, had in general failed to respect the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>. In a union of <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> with <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, he foresaw a limitation of the power of the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> nobles; in his character of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, it was clear to him that such curtailment would be a safeguard to the temporalities of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
