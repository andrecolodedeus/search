<h1>J&ouml;rgen Zoega</h1>  

<p>(GEORGE).

<p>Archaeologist and <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatist</a>, born at Daler near T&ouml;nder, near the west coast of northern Schleswig, 20 December, 1755; died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 10 February, 1809. His father, whose <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> came originally from Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, was Christian Zoega, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Vilhad; his mother was Henriette Clausen. When a boy J&ouml;rgen was taught at home, and then attended the gymnasium at Altona. He went in 1773 to the University of G&ouml;ttingen and later to <a href="../cathen/09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, studying <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and the Classics. Repeated journeys to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> developed the interest for archaeology which had awakened early in him. In 1782, by the good offices of the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> minister Guldberg, he received for two years a pension from the State. From <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where he studied under the celebrated <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatist</a> <a href="../cathen/05274b.htm">Eckhel</a>, Zoega went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> early in 1783. Through introductions he received here a kindly welcome from <a href="../cathen/02685a.htm">Stefano Borgia</a>, then a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> and later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. On his way home Zoega heard at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> of the political overthrow of his patron Guldberg. He, therefore, returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and took up his permanent abode in the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>, which a man, as he said, should never see or else never leave. He had before this catalogued and exhaustively described Borgia's fine collection of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> now gave him hearty support and <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> granted him a pension of 400 <em>scudi.</em> With the aid of influential friends Zoega also received permanent assistance from <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, and in 1790 was made an honorary member of the Academy of Art at <a href="../cathen/04352a.htm">Copenhagen</a>. When his patron, <a href="../cathen/02685a.htm">Cardinal Borgia</a>, was exiled from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1798, Zoega, grateful for the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hospitality to Danes who had gone to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, obtained a pension for Borgia from the state revenues of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. From 1798 Zoega was <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> consul at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and a member of the Academy of Sciences at <a href="../cathen/04352a.htm">Copenhagen</a>. His labours in <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatics</a> led him to take up Egyptological and Coptic studies, which he carried on with success. By his power of penetration and sound judgment he pointed out to later investigators the path to be followed in the interpretation of hieroglyphics. He is regarded as the associate of <a href="../cathen/15650a.htm">Winckelmann</a> and Visconti in establishing scientific archaeology. His services to learning were also acknowledged in foreign countries by his election in 1806 to membership in the Academies of Science at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>.

<p>Zoega's most important works are: "Nummi aegyptii imperatorii" (Rome, 1787); "De origine et usu obeliscorum" (Rome, 1797); "Bassirilievi antichi di <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>" (2 vols., Rome, 1808), translated into German by Welcker (1811); "Catalogus codicum copticorum manuscriptorum, qui in musco Borgiano Velitris adservantu" (Rome, 1810), a posthumous work. He also wrote several treatises on classical archaeology, translated into German by Welcker, "Georg Zoegas Abhandlungen" (Gottingen, 1817). A work on the topography of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was left unfinished in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>.
