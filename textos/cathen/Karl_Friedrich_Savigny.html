<h1>Karl Friedrich Savigny</h1>  

<p>Diplomatist, born at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 19 Sept., 1814; died at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort-on-the-Main</a>, 11 Feb., 1875. He was the son of the great jurist Friedrich Karl von Savigny, who was then privy councillor of the court of appeals, member of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> council of State, and professor at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, and of his wife, Kunigunde Brentano, sister of the poet Klemens Brentano. The father was a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, but the mother was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and the children were allowed to follow the religion of the mother. Karl Friedrich was first taught at home, then attended the French <em>Gymnasium</em> at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, the Collegium Romanum at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and the Collegium Sebastianum at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. He studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In 1836 he became an <em>auscultator</em> at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>; in 1837 he was a <em>referendar</em> in the court at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, in 1840 secretary of legation at <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and Dresden, in 1842 at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, in 1848 at <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. In 1849 he was councillor of legations and member of the ministry of foreign affairs, and in 1850 ambassador at Karlsruhe. While here he was able to win over the Government of Baden for the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> policy, and, as Bismarck testified, "by cautious and tactful bearing to win a commanding position at Karlsruhe for the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> government."

<p>From 1859 Karl Friedrich was <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> ambassador at <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>, from 1862 at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, and from 1864 he was minister with full powers at the Diet of the German Confederation at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>. In 1866 he offered at the Diet the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> motion for the reform of the German Confederation, and when it was rejected on 14 June, 1866, he declared the withdrawal of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, upon which the Austro-Prussian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> began. Later in connection with Bismarck he was plenipotentiary in making a treaty of peace with the states of southern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and Saxony. He was the presiding officer of the government conferences for the drafting of a constitution for the North German Confederation, and was a plenipotentiary at the Reichstag which decided the constitution. Thus he performed important services in national affairs. In 1868 he retired partially, and in 1871 entirely, from government positions in order to become one of the parliamentary leaders of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. From 1867 he was a member of the Lower House of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Diet, from 1868 a member of the Lower House of the Diet of the North German Confederation, and later of the German Reichstag, or Parliament of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. In 1871 he took part in the founding of the <a href="../cathen/16020b.htm">Centre Party</a>. He was not particularly distinguished as a speaker, but his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, distinguished <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, and connections were of much benefit to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause.
