<h1>Karl Johann Greith</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> and church historian, b. at Rapperswyl, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, 25 May, 1897; d. at St. Gall, 17 May, 1882. He received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at St. Gall, then went to the lyceum at <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a> and the University of Munich; at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> he studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and history, and was fortunate enough to meet with the fatherly protection of the famous Joseph von G&ouml;rres. In 1829 he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to perfect himself in <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> work; while there he decided to enter the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and completed his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies in the Sulpician <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of that city. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1831, and was made sub-librarian of St. Gall, also sub-regent and professor of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a>. During the ecclesiastico-political troubles which soon after distracted his fatherland, Greith was prominent with pen and voice in defence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He was, consequently, deprived of his offices, wherefore he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, at the instance of the English Government, for the purpose of collecting documents in the Roman <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> and archives relating to English history. After the restoration of peace he devoted himself to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> work in St. Gall, was made dean of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in 1847, professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in 1853, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Gall in 1862. From early youth he had been an intimate friend of <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, and at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> he held, in regard to the question of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">Papal Infallibility</a>, that a dogmatic decision was unadvisable under existing circumstances. However, he accepted loyally the decision of the Council and used all his influence to induce <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> to do the same. Greith was a strong champion of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> interests and continually defended the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the encroachments of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>. He could not prevent the suppression of his <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys nor hinder the civil prohibition of missions and retreats; nevertheless he renewed the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and called into being an <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. He devoted himself with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to the study of history and corresponded with numerous scholars, among others Lasaberg, Pertz, B&ouml;hmer, Franz Pfeiffer, Schosser, <a href="../cathen/10478b.htm">Mone</a>, <a href="../cathen/10564d.htm">Gall Morel</a>, and others. His numerous ecclesiastico-political writings were only of transient importance, though they bear witness to his thoroughly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sentiments. As an orator he was not infrequently called the <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. In his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> and pastoral letters he laid great stress on the greatness and majesty of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as exhibited in the Redemption and in the founding and continuous activity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He published: "Katholische Apologetik in Kanzelreden" in three volumes (Schaffhausen, 1847-52); he also wrote, in collaboration with the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Georg Ulber, "Handbuch der Philosophie fur die Schule und das Leben" (Frieburg, 1853-57). Greith had no sympathy with <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a> and esteemed too highly <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a> and Leibnitz. His best and most lasting work was done in history. Among his historical publications were: "Spicilegium Vaticanum, Beitr&auml;ge zur n&auml;heren Kenntniss der vatikanischen Bibliothek f&uuml;r deutsche Poesie des Mittelalters" (Frauenfeld, 1838); "Die deutsche Mystik im Predigerorden" (Freiburg, 1861); "Der heilge Gallus (St. Gall, 1864); "Die heiligen Glauensboten Columban und Gall (St. Gall, 1865); "Geschichte der altirischen Kirche und ihrer Verbindung mit Rom, Gallien und Alemannien, 430-630 (Freiburg, 1867). This last work is his chief literary monument and still retains its value as an exhaustive study of the foreign relations of the early <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church, especially its relations with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and its missionary work.
