<h1>Karl M&uuml;ller</h1>  

<p>Professor at D&uuml;sseldorf, b. at Darmstadt, 29 Oct., 1818; d. at Neuenahr, 15 Aug., 1893, belongs to the more recent members of a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of German <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">religious painters</a> known as the "Nazarenes", who succeeded felicitously in popular but beautiful representation of religious devotion, and gave new renown to the D&uuml;sseldorf <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> even in foreign lands. His style, delicate even to softness, exhibits, however, as much naturalness, fresh, simple <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and spiritual peace as the subjects demand. <a href="../cathen/13518a.htm">Schadow</a>, director of the D&uuml;sseldorf academy, had selected in 1837 the nineteen year old student, along with his brother Andreas, and <a href="../cathen/04677b.htm">Deger</a> (who were later joined by <a href="../cathen/08256a.htm">Ittenbach</a>), for the contemplated fresco <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> in the F&uuml;rstenburg church on the Apollinarisberg at Remagen. They had first to study carefully in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the technique of fresco <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, then little known. Karl M&uuml;ller arrived in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the end of 1839. The study and imitation of the art treasures of the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>, as later of those of Florence, <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, and other places, brought to maturity his great natural talent. His taste for landscape, which he brought with him from D&uuml;sseldorf, now found the greatest encouragement; he regarded moreover the study of models as indispensable in the practical exercise of his art. A large circle of German and Italian friends mutually helped each other by artistic excursions. His evenings he spent in composition and the like. At the end of four years the master brought home his characteristic German religious style, lightly mingled with some southern elements. In his principal <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of the "Crowning" and the "Birth of Mary" (entirely finished in 1850) he showed himself, according to the judgment of connoisseurs, the equal of the elder <a href="../cathen/04677b.htm">Deger</a>. The former <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> unfortunately is in a bad light the greater part of the year. The lower part, the Apostles by the grave, out of which spring lilies and roses, is widely known. The leading scene in the upper part presents the Virgin Mother bowed before the Saviour in a Raphaelite beauty of colour. The <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> worked so long over the "Birth of Mary" that he hoped to succeed in some degree in satisfying the spirit at once of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05209c.htm">D&uuml;rer</a>. In this work the eight typical <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> especially deserve to be noticed. Besides these there belong to M&uuml;ller in the same church the "Annunciation", the "Visitation", the "Wedding of the Virgin", and the "Lamb of God", adored by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the midst of the symbols of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> on the triumphant arch. In 1859 a contract was made with the authorities of the church of Notre-Dame de La Garde at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> in regard to the great pictorial scheme, unfortunately never carried out. The upper part of the cartoon of a new "Coronation of Mary" wonderful in execution, is in the Berlin National Gallery. For the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a>, undertaken in 1866, eighteen <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> were contemplated. The objections of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> also caused this monumental work, to the master's unutterable sorrow, to fail. His easel pictures, however, are all the better known: "The Magnificat", "Wonder of Roses", "Immaculate Conception", "Joseph with the Boy Jesus", "The Disciples in Emmaus"; the popular round pictures; "Mary and Elizabeth", the "Holy Family at Work", also "The Holy Family", "The Holy Night", and so on. Of the highest value in art are the alter <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, "Christ with the Disciples at <a href="../cathen/05405a.htm">Emmaus</a>," which he undertook for the church of <a href="../cathen/12763b.htm">St. Remigius</a> at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a>, and his last cartoon for the same church, completed by his nephew Franz M&uuml;ller.
