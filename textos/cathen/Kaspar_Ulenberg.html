<h1>Kaspar Ulenberg</h1>  

<p>Convert, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writer and translator of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, born at Lippstadt on the Lippe, <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, in 1549; died at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, 16 Feb., 1617. He was the son of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and was intended for the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> ministry. He received his grammar-school <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in Lippstadt, Soest, and Brunswick, and from 1569 studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>. While studying <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> writings there his first <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> doctrines were awakened, and were then increased by hearing the disputes between the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and by the appearance of <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> in <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>. After completing his studies he taught for a short time in the Latin <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Lunden in Dithmarschen; he was then sent by his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to Cologne to bring back to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> a kinsman who had become <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. After accomplishing this task he remained in <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, where, through his friendship with Johann Nopelius and Gerwin Calenius (<a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countrymen of his), he had an opportunity of becoming acquainted with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life and teaching. In 1572 he <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and soon afterwards, upon obtaining degrees in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04120a.htm">University of Cologne</a>, became professor at the Gymnasium Laurentianum at Cologne. In 1575 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and became <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Kaiserswerth. In 1583 he was made <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of St. Cunibert's in <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, where he laboured <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> by preaching and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> exercises, and made many conversions. In 1593 he became regent of the Laurentian gymnasium, retaining this position for twenty-two years. From 1600 to 1606 he directed the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of princes Wilhelm and Hermann of Baden, sons of Margrave Edward Fortunatus of Baden-Baden. In 1605 he became <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of St. Columba's in <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and from 1610 to 1612 was also <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>.

<p>Ulenberg began his literary career at Kaiserwerth with the work, "Die Psalmen David's in allerlei deutsche Gesangreime gebracht" (Cologne, 1582), an excellent <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> book for the common people, which was widely circulated and often reprinted; the last and revised edition was by M. Kaufmann (Augsburg, 1835). To the first edition was appended a "Katechismus oder kurzer Bericht der ganzen christl. kathol. Religion sammt Warnung wider allerlei unserer Zeit Irrthumb". He completed at Cologne (1589) his chief <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> work, "Erhebliche und wichtige Ursachen, warumb die altgl&auml;ubige Catholische Christen bei dem alten wahren Christenthumb bis in ihren Tod best&auml;ndiglich verharren", of which he also issued a Latin edition entitled: "Causae graves et justae, cur Catholicis in communione veteris ejusque veri Christianismi constanter usque ad finem vitae permanendum, cur item omnibus, qui se Evangelicos vocant, relictis erroribus ad ejusdem Christianismi consortium vel postliminio redeundum sit". This is one of the best controversial treatises of the sixteenth century and is still instructive reading. A new and revised edition was prepared by M.W. Kerp entitled: "Zweiundzwanzig Beweggr&uuml;nde. Ein buch f&uuml;r Katholische und Evangelische" (Mainz, 1827, 1833, and 1840). Other works worthy of mention are: <ul><li>"Trostbuch f&uuml;r die Kranken und Sterbenden" (Cologne, 1590), often reprinted; <li>"Historia de vita, moribus, rebus gestis, studiis ac denique morte Praedicantium Lutheranorum, D. Martini Lutheri, Philippi Melanchthonis, Matthiae Flacii Illyrici, Georgii Maioris, et Andraea Osiandri", which was edited after Ulenberg's death by Arnold Meshovius (1622), a German edition being issued at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (2 vols., 1836-37). <li>Ulenberg also wrote various shorter polemical and <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> treatises. His last and most important literary work (Sacra Biblia, das ist, die gantze Heilige Schrifft, Alten und Neuen Testaments, nach der letzten R&ouml;misch Sixtiner Edition mit fleiss &uuml;bergesetxt), the German translation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, he began (1614) at the request of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> and Elector of Cologne, Ferdinand Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and finished shortly before his death. The first edition appeared at Cologne in 1630; eleven other editions were published at Cologne up to 1747, and eleven more at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. <li>The German Bible which was published (Mainz, 1662) at the command of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> and Elector of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, Johann Philip Count of Sch&ouml;nborn, was a revision of Ulenberg's translation. This revision, entitled "Die catholische Mainzer Bibel", is still frequently printed and until <a href="../cathen/11325a.htm">Allioli's</a> translation appeared was the most popular German translation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>.</ul>
