<h1>Kenosis</h1>  

<p>A term derived from the discussion as to the real meaning of Phil. 2:6 sqq.: "Who being in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: But emptied [<em>ekenosen</em>] himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and in habit found as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>."
<h2>Protestant opinions</h2>

<p>The early <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, not satisfied with the teaching of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> on this point, professed to a deeper meaning in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> words, but <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and a <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchton</a> failed in their speculations. John Brenz (d. 10 September, 1570), of T&uuml;bingen, maintained that as the Word assumed <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, so His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> not only possessed the Divinity, but also had the power to make use of the Divinity, though it freely abstained from such a use. Chemnitz differed from this view. He denied that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> possessed the Divinity in such a way as to have a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to its use. The kenosis, or the exinanition, of His <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a> was, therefore, a <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to Brenz; it was the connatural consequence of the Incarnation, according to Chemnitz.

<p>Among modern <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> the following opinons have been the most prevalent:

<ul><li>Thomasius, Delitzcsh, and Kahnis regard the Incarnation as a self-emptying of the Divine manner of existence, as a self-limitation of the Word's omniscience, omnipresence, etc. <li>Gess, <a href="../cathen/12799b.htm">Reuss</a>, and Godet contend that the Incarnation implies a real depotentiation of the Word; the Word became, rather than assumed, the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <li>Ebrard holds that the Divine properties in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appeared under the <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantian</a> time-form appropriate to man; his kenosis consists in an exchange of the eternal for a time-form of existence. <li>Martensen and perhaps Hutton distinguish a double life of the Word: In the Man-Christ they see a kenosis and a real depotentiation of the Word; in the world the purely Divine Word carries the work of mediator and revealer. According to Godet, and probably also Gore, the Word in His kenosis strips Himself even of His immutable <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and His personal consciousness, so as to enter into a human development similar to ours.</ul>
<h2>Catholic teaching</h2>

<p>According to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, the abasement of the Word consists in the assumption of humanity and the simultaneous occultation of the Divinity. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> abasement is seen first in His subjecting Himself to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of human birth and growth and to the lowliness of fallen <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. His likeness, in His abasement, to the fallen nature does not compromise the actual loss of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, but only the pains and penalties attached to the loss. These fall partly on the body, partly on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and consist in liability to suffering from internal and external causes.

<p>As to the body, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> dignity excludes some bodily pains and states. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> all-preserving power inhabiting the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> did not allow any corruption; it also prevented disease or the beginning of corruption. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> was not compatible with decomposition after death, which is the image of the destroying power of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. In fact, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to be free from all bodily pain, and His human will had the power to remove or suspend the action of the causes of pain. But He freely subjected Himself to most of the pains resulting from bodily exertion and adverse external influences, e.g. fatigue, hunger, wounds, etc. As these pains had their sufficient reason in the nature of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, they were natural to Him.

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> retained in Him also the weaknesses of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the passions of His rational and sensitive <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetites</a>, but with the following restrictions: (a) Inordinate and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> motions are incompatible with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Only morally blameless passions and affections, e.g. fear, sadness, the share of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the sufferings of the body, were compatible with His Divinity and His spiritual perfection. (b) The origin, intensity, and duration of even these emotions were subject to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> free choice. Besides, He could prevent their disturbing the actions of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and His peace of mind.

<p>To complete His abasement, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was subject to His Mother and St. Joseph, to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the State and the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">positive laws of God</a>; He shared the hardships and privations of the <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poor</a> and the lowly.
