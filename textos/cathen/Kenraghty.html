<p><a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, d. 30 April, 1585, at Clonmel, Co. Tipperary. He was the son of a silversmith at Kilmallock, embraced the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>, studied abroad, and graduated bachelor in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Returning to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, he became <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Gerald, sixteenth Earl of Desmond, and shared the fortunes of his patron's struggle against Queen Elizabeth. In September, 1583, a fugitive with the earl, he was surprised on Sliabh Luachra by Lord Roche's gallowglasses, and handed over to the Earl of Ormond. By Ormond's command he was chained to one Patrick Grant, and sent to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> at Clonmel. Here he lay in irons, exhorting, instructing, and hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a> at his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> grate until April, 1585. His jailer was then bribed by Victor White, a leading townsman, to release the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for one night to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> and administer the Paschal Communion in White's house on <a href="../cathen/11535a.htm">Passion Sunday</a>. The jailer secretly warned the President of Munster to take this opportunity of apprehending most of the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">recusants</a> at Mass. In the morning an armed force surrounded the house, arrested White and others seized the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a>, and sought the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> everywhere. He had been hidden under straw at the first alarm, and, though wounded when the heap was probed, ultimately escaped to the woods. Learning, however, that White's life could not be saved but by his own surrender, he gave himself up, and was at once tried by martial law. Pardon and preferment were offered him for conforming, but he resolutely maintained the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> authorlty, and was executed as a traitor. His head was set up in the market-place, and his body, purchased from the soldiers, was buried behind the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. He is one of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> whose cause of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> is now in progress.
