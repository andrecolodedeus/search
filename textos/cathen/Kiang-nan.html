<h1>Kiang-nan</h1>  

<p>(Vicariate Apostolic)

<p>The present Vicariate comprises the two provinces of Kiang-su and Ngan-hwei. Its alluvial lands make it, especially Kiang-su, one of the richest and most populous countries of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. The number of inhabitants of both provinces exceeds 60,000,000. <a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Father Matteo Ricci, S.J.</a>, was its first missionary, introducing the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion into this country at the end of the sixteenth century. He found a powerful aid in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the emperor's minister, the famous academician Paul Siu Kwang-k'i, whom he met first at Kwang-tung and later at Peking. Baptized in 1603 at Nan-king, Paul Siu returned to Shang-hai, his native place, and there converted many <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>. In 1607 he took with him from Peking Father Lazzaro Cattaneo, who built a residence and a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> still to be seen at Shanghai. Returning to Peking, he first followed the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit fathers</a> in their disgrace, was restored to favour in 1628, and died there in 1633. In 1641 his remains were transferred to Zi-ka-wei, where they still rest, and the principal establishment of the new mission is in the vicinity his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> <a href="../cathen/02737b.htm">Franciso Brancati</a> and Geronimo de Gravina were at this period building the churches of Sun-kiang, Su-chou, Tsong-ming; Father Sambriani, those of Nan-king, Shanking, Yang-chou, Hwai-ngan. The mission of Kiang-nan enjoyed peace from 1644 to 1661, but the missionaries were too few for the work. In 1660 the Vicariate Apostolic of Kiang-nan was created and confided to Bishop Ignazio Cotolendi of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> <a href="../cathen/14079a.htm">Society of Foreign Missions</a>. During the persecutions from 1664 to 1671 twenty <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were exiled to <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a>, <a href="../cathen/15346a.htm">Father Verbiest</a> in Peking obtaining their release in the latter year. After the death of K'ang-hi, Yung Chen exiled all the missionaries of the provinces; a few, however, succeeded in hiding themselves, and, helped by twelve or fifteen <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, attended to the wants of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. In 1690 <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Alexander VIII</a> created the Diocese of Nan-king, placing it under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> and with authority over the provinces of Kiang-nan and Ho-nan. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Nan-king was Allessandro Ciceri of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a> on 2 Feb., 1696. His last successor was Gaietano Pires-Pireira, a Portuguese <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> (d. at Peking, 1846). After 18336 the Diocese of Nan-king was governed by Apostolic administrators until 1856, when the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> was abandoned.

<p>In 1736 the mandarins commenced a bloody <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which lasted a whole century. At Kiang-nan Fr. Tristan of Athemis was the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> arrested. The superior of the mission, Father Anthony Joseph Henriquez, was pursued and surrendered on 21 Dec., 1747. Both missionaries were strangled as Su-chou 17 Sept., 1748. The process of their <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> is not yet finished. Three <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries followed in Kiang-nan, viz., Fathers Ignatius Perez, Martin Correa, and Godefroy of Lambeckhoven, named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nan-king on 15 May, 1752, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a> on 22 July, 1756. He remained thirty years at Kiang-nan with two <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, Mark Kwan and John Yau. It is related that in 1784 Bishop Godefroy entered Su-chou as a chair-dealer to ordain some new <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. He died on 22 May, 1787, but not before sorrowfully proclaiming, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the dissolution of his own <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. Before his death he obtained the favour of re-entering the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, yet surviving in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. For the next fifty years only <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> conducted the Kiang-nan mission. In 1830, two Portuguese <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, Fathers Maranda and Henriquez, arrived in Kiang-nan. From 1835 to 1840 Father Ferdinand Faivre and Peter Lavaissi&egrave;re made temporary sojourns in the mission. In reality, from 1787 to the return of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1840, Kiang-nan was governed by native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who kept alive the Faith.

<p>In 1833 Gaietano Peres-Pereira was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kiang-nan, and resided at Peking, relegating his powers to Father Henriquez, a <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> like himself residing at <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a>. On 1 Oct., 1838, Mgr Peres, last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nan-king, conferred the powers of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to Father Louis de Besi, named in 1841 Vicar-Apostolic of Shan-tung and administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Nan-king and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03297b.htm">Canopus</a>. He arrived at Kiang-nan in 1842, and obtained some <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> from <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, and from Father Roothan, then General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. Fathers Gotteland, Benjamin Brueye, and Fran&ccedil;ois left <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> on 28 April, 1840. In 1842 a treaty between <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> resulted in the opening of five Chinese ports, among them Shanghai. Five new fathers and one brother left <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in 1842. They made the voyage with M. de Lagren&eacute;, ambassador of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to Peking, who in 1844 obtained permission for the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. Bishop de Besi appointed Fr. Brueye to found the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which was opened on 3 Feb., 1843, with twenty-three students. In 1853 it was established at Song-kia-tu. In 1849 all the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> settlements were confided to the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; they contained four thousand seven hundred and fifty <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. The rebels invaded in 1853 a great part of the province and remained there eleven years. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> established themselves in 1847 at Za-ka-wei, near the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Paul Siu, at which period of the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> of the mission were commenced. An asylum for girls was a founded in 1855 near Wang-tan. In 1853 the Chang-mau rebels (Tai-ping) took possession of Nan-king, then of Shanghai, but abandoned the latter in 1854.

<p>Bishop de Besi left for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1847, leaving the government of the mission to his co-adjutor, Bishop Maresca. In 1849 the latter was named administrator of the Diocese of Nan-king, but returned to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, owing to ill-health, on 8 April, 1855. On 13 Nov. of the same year he died at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. The Diocese of Nan-king was then suppressed, and the Vicariate Apostolic of Kiang-nan the entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Father Pierre Andr&eacute; Borgniet became administrator Apostolic in 1856. During the eight years of his administratorship the rebels laid waste all the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missions of Kiang-nan except that of Shanghai. Then followed the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the French and English against <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, beginning in 1857. A treaty was signed in 1858, but the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was renewed in 1860, at the end of which entrance into <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> was obtained. In 1859 the rebels held only Nan-king, but suddenly became stronger. Father Massa was arrested by them but made his escape; his brother Louis, however, was killed by defending the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> of Tsai-kia-wan. The <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> was pillaged and burned, and many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were massacred. A few <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> natives of <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a> were able to defend Tung-kia-tu and Za-ka-wei. In 1862 Admirals Hope and Protet opened a campaign, but the latter as killed at Nan-kiau. Major Gordon, who commanded some four to five thousand men, gained some advantage, but was dismissed in 1866 by the Chinese. At the end of the same year the rebels were driven out of every place they had held. The missions, however, suffered much in the meantime. Father Vuillaume was killed on 4 March, 1862; between 1856 and 1864 twenty-four missionaries died, and before the close of 1865 six or seven were victims of typhus. Bishop Borgniet died of cholera on 31 July, 1862. Mgr Hippolyte Adrien Languillat, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sergioplois and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Chi-li since Sept., 1856, was named <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Kiang-nan on 2 Feb., 1865, and at once undertook to restore the ruins occasioned by the rebels. He went in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1867 and brought back with him religious Helpers of the Souls in Purgatory and some <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>. He founded the observatory about the same period, and took part in the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> in 1870, but in 1874 a stroke of apoplexy almost disabled him for any active service. The following are the statistics for the years 1865 and 1878. In 1865, 42 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 12 <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 184 missions, 71,184 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and 5038 pupils in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; in 1878, 56 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> and 26 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 585 missions, 93,310 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, 9135 pupils in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.

<p>Father Carr&eacute;re suffered much at Nan-king. Driven out of this city by Li Hung Chang, he was recalled by the consul of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> from Shanghai; he died on 17 Aug., 1868. A <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for aged men was established at Shanghai in 1867, and the <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> School was opened. A severe <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> broke out in 1876. In March some residences were pillaged, and a catechist massacred. On 13 July a <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was massacred with some of his students and a boy from the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was set afire, and the bodies of the victims were consumed. The girls of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and their teachers were taken into captivity. Everywhere the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were pillaged, and their <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> burned. Bishop Languillat died during this <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, at Zi-ka-wei, on 29 Nov., 1878. Bishop Valentine Garnier, already chosen coadjutor, was named his successor; he was fifty-four years old, and governed the mission nineteen years. The accounts of his administration from 1879 to 1878 are as follows: in 1879, 50 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> and 29 <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 580 missions, 345 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys with 6222 pupils, 213 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls with 2791 pupils, 91,175 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; in 1898, 116 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> and 40 <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 896 missions, 390 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys with 10,663 pupils, 449 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls with 5208 pupils, 155,177 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.

<p>The fathers succeeded in establishing themselves finally in the centre of Ngan-hwei. In 1882, Bishop Garnier sent missionaries to Su-chou-fu, the most northern prefecture of the province of Kiang-su. The fathers bought a house in the city, and then commenced their difficulties, which lasted fourteen years. On 5 Feb., 1889, the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> concession of Chin-kiang was attacked by the Chinese, the consulate of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was pillaged and burned, but the church and residence of the mission was spared. On 2 May, 1891, some of the rabble besieged the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> of the mission, but soldiers rescued the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. On 12 May, 1891, Wu-hu and then Ngan-king were attacked, but the presence of a French vessel saved them. However, five or six <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> were pillaged and burned in the interior of the province. Tranquility was restored, thanks to the presence of Admiral Besnard. Bishop Garnier died on 14 July, 1898. Bishop Simon was named Vicar Apostolic in Jan., 1899, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 25 June; he died on 25 Aug. of the same year at Wu-hu. At the end of 1900, Bishop <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, superior of the mission, was named Vicar Apostolic and <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Silanda. The following was the condition of the mission in 1907: 1 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; 142 <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of whom 26 are Chinese; 35 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; 696 churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; one grand <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Zi-ka-wei with 29 students; one little <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> with 15 students; 558 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys with 14,175 pupils; 604 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls with 9360 pupils; two colleges for boys with 408 students; 2 colleges for <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> girls with 766 students (in Shanghai); 1 English <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> with 543 pupils; 1 French <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 336 pupils; 6 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> with 3898 patients; 6 asylums for old men with 198 inmates; 37 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> with 6584 children; 29 <a href="../cathen/09749c.htm">Little Brothers of Mary</a>; 32 <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, 20 of whom are natives; 91 Helpers of the Souls in Purgatory, 33 of whom are natives; 31 Sisters of Charity; 9 <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>; 173 Chinese religious; 145,219 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and 92,018 <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>.
