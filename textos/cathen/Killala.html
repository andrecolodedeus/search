<h1>Killala</h1>  

<p>(ALLADENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a>. It is one of the five suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Province of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, and comprises the north-western part of the County Mayo with the Barony of Tireragh in the County Sligo. In all there are 22 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, some of which, bordering on the Atlantic Ocean, consist mostly of wild moorland, sparsely inhabited. Lewis's Topographical Dictionary sets down the length of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> as 45 miles, the breadth 21 miles, and the estimated superficies as 314,300 acres &mdash; of which 43,100 are in the County Sligo, and 271,200 in the County Mayo. In the census returns for the year 1901 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is given as 61,876, and the non-Catholic as 3576. The foundation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> dates from the time of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, who placed his disciple St. Muredach over the church called in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Cell Alaid. In a well that still flows close to the town, beside the sea, <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in a single day 12,000 converts, and on the same occasion, in presence of the crowds, raised to life a dead <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whom he also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Muredach is described as an old man of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick's</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and was appointed to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Killala as early as 442 or 443. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast-day</a> is 12 August. It is probable that he resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> after a few years, and retired to end his life in the lonely island in Donegal Bay which has ever since borne his name, Innismurray. It was at Killala that <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the two maidens whom he met in childhood at Focluth Wood by the western sea, and whose voices in visions of the night had often pathetically called him to come once more and dwell amongst them. He did come, and he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> them, and built them a church where they spent the rest of their days as <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Little or nothing is known of the successors of Muredach in Killala down to the twelfth century. Of the sainted Bishop Cellach, for example, we learn merely that he came of royal blood, flourished in the sixth century, and was foully <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> at the instigation of his foster-brother. His name is mentioned in all the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a>. Beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, however, the most illustrious of them all belongs to modern times. With pardonable <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> the people of Killala still, and will ever, recall the fact that John McHale, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, was a child of their diocese, and, if we may so speak, served his apprenticeship as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> amongst them. He was born at Tubbernavine, at the foot of Mount Nephin, 6 March, 1791; became Coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Killala in 1825, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1834, and later in the same year was transferred to <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, where for nearly half a century he exercised a more potent influence on the civil and <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> than perhaps any of his contemporaries, with the single exception of O'Connell. He died 7 November, 1881, and is buried in the sanctuary of the Tuam <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. After him came Doctor Finan, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of remarkable <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and attainments, but rather unfit, owning to his continental training, to direct the affairs of an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> diocese. On his resignation in the year 1838, a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Archdiocese of Tuam</a>, Rev. Thomas Feeney, who had formerly been professor and president of <a href="../cathen/08323c.htm">St. Jarlath's</a> College, <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, was chosen for the task of repairing the injury that <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> had suffered during his reign. Feeney is said to have been a most <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> selection under the circumstances. Thirty-five years of his firm and resolute rule obliterated practically all traces of the wretched controversies that distracted the diocese under his predecessor.

<p>The town of Killala is remarkable in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> history as the place where the French under General Humbert landed in 1798. The exact spot is by the rocky ledge in the outer estuary of the Moy known as "St. Patrick's Rocks", from which it is said that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> set sail when making his escape as a poor young slave from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The French officers occupied the palace of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> where they lived for a short time with his lordship and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Stock) has written a most interesting and authentic account of the "Invasion", and of the sayings and doings of these gentlemen which he himself saw and heard. Along the left bank of the river are the ruins of several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Rosserk, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> house of strict observance, was founded in 1460. The beautiful Abbey of Moyne still stands nearly perfect on a most picturesque site just over the river, and further on, north of Killala, was the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Abbey of Rathfran, also delightfully situated. On the promontory of Errew running into Lough Conn there was another <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which existed as such till comparatively recent times. A fine round tower in Killala itself, still in perfect preservation, indicated the ancient celebrity of the place as an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> centre. Indeed it may be safely stated that in no other portion of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> of equal extent were the labours of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> and the holy founders of religious institutions who came after him so arduous and full of interest as in this beautiful district of Tirawley.

<p>Tireragh and Tirawley need not rely entirely for their fame on the traditions of the past, near or remote. Under the present occupant of the See of Killala religion has made quiet but very gratifying progress. One may judge of the learning and ability of Dr. Conmy from the fact that in <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth</a> he held a distinguished place in the class that produced such men as the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and Archbishop Carr of <a href="../cathen/10155a.htm">Melbourne</a>. After several years of fruitful labours as professor and missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> he was called in 1892 from the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Crossmolina to wield the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> of Muredach. His rule has been characterized by <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that is well tempered with mercy. Amongst his most conspicuous services to the twin cause of religion and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> must be reckoned the building and equipping, from funds raised almost exclusively from his own faithful <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and people, of the splendid <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> that now <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> the town of Ballina, and bids fair to revive the olden name of the School of Killala founded by <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> lives in a plain but commodious dwelling in Ballina, hard by the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which since its opening has been the dearest object of his episcopal <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>.
