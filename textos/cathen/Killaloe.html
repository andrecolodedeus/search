<h1>Killaloe</h1>  

<p>(LAONIA)

<p>A suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>; it comprises the greater part of County Clare, a large portion of Tipperary, and parts of King's and Queen's Counties, <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>. Its <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> name is Cill-da-Lua, so named from St. Lua, an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> who lived about the end of the sixth century, and whose oratory can still be seen in Friar's Island, near the town of Killaloe. Though St. Lua gave his name to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, St. Flannan is its <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a>. He was of royal lineage, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> being the saintly Theodoric, King of Thomond, who towards the close of his life received the monastic habit from St. Colman at <a href="../cathen/09283a.htm">Lismore</a>. St. Flannan was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Killaloe, and is said to have been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/08422b.htm">John IV</a> about 640. In the time of St. Flannan, the Diocese of Killaloe was not so extensive as it is at present. It did not then include the old <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Roscrea and Inniscathy. It was only when these were suppressed at the Synod of Rathbresail in the first quarter of the twelfth century, that Killaloe assumed its present shape, which is almost coterminous with the boundaries of the ancient Kingdom of Thomond. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Seir Kieran in King's County, though in Thomond, was allowed to remain subject to the <a href="../cathen/11342b.htm">Diocese of Ossory</a>, out of respect to the memory of St. Kieran.

<p>The old See of Roscrea grew around a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> founded there by <a href="../cathen/04514d.htm">St. Cronan</a> about the middle of the sixth century. This <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> became a famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and it was within its walls that the scribe Dimma wrote for <a href="../cathen/04514d.htm">St. Cronan</a> the copy of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a> now in the Library of Trinity College, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, for which Tatheus O'Carroll, chieftain of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, made a costly shrine in the twelfth century. The Diocese of Roscrea was coextensive with the territory of the O'Carrolls, added to that of the O'Kennedys. Ware holds that <a href="../cathen/04514d.htm">St. Cronan</a> was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Roscrea, but <a href="../cathen/16051a.htm">Lanigan</a> thinks that Ware has been misled by the fact that Roscrea became an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. Like the Diocese of Roscrea, the Diocese of Inniscathy grew around the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Inniscathy, founded by <a href="../cathen/13713a.htm">St. Senan</a> in the early portion of the sixth century. There is no question about <a href="../cathen/13713a.htm">St. Senan</a> being the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Diocese of Inniscathy, which comprised the Baronies of Moyarta, Clonderlaw, and Ibricken, in Clare; the Barony of Connello, in Limerick; and in Kerry, the ancient region of the Hy-Fidgente. The last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Inniscathy was Hugh O'Beachain, who died in 1188. Nevertheless, there were <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> up to the close of the fourteenth century. The remains of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of Inniscathy and a round tower now mark the ancient see of <a href="../cathen/13713a.htm">St. Senan</a>. The Clog-oir, too, still in existence in County Clare, is a highly-prized relic of Inniscathy. St. Brecan's churches of Carntemple, Doora, and Clooney, St. Tola's church at Dysert O'Dea, <a href="../cathen/13713a.htm">St. Senan's</a> hermitage at Bishop's Island, near Kilkee, St. Caimin's church and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Iniscaltra, <a href="../cathen/02758c.htm">St. Brendan's</a> and <a href="../cathen/04514d.htm">St. Cronan's</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> at Birr and Roscrea may be named amongst hundreds of churches, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and hermitages, which covered Killaloe like a network and which in their decay attest to the devotion to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> of the far-famed Dalgais.

<p>Some of these foundations deserve mention. Iniscaltra, a green little island in Lough Derg, was celebrated nursery of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and learning in Thomond. It is associated principally with St. Caimin, who made Iniscaltra the seat of a very famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which attracted pupils even from foreign countries. A fragment of the commentary on the Psalms collated with the Hebrew text, written by St. Caimin (640), is preserved in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, Merchant's Quay, Dublin. Birr also was a celebrated seat of learning in Thomond, founded by <a href="../cathen/02758c.htm">St. Brendan</a> (550). The Gospels of McRegol, now in the Bodleian Library, were written by McRegol, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Birr, in 820. Terryglass also was a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of great repute founded by St. Columba (552). It was here that <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> is said to have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the Dalgais from Northern Thomond, who crossed Lough Derg in their coracles to meet him. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Lorrha, founded by <a href="../cathen/13214a.htm">St. Ruadhan</a> (550), can claim that it was within its walls that the famous Stowe <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, now in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of Lord Ashburnham, was written; but the desertion of Tara owing to the alleged cursing of <a href="../cathen/13214a.htm">St. Ruadhan</a>, is without historical foundation. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> at Ennis and Quin are striking illustrations of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and munificence of the foremost chieftains of the Dalgais.

<p>About 1240 Donogh Cairbreach O'Brien built the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventual Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>. It was considered one of the finest houses of the order in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and ultimately it became the occasion of Ennis being made the capital of County Clare. Even in ruin it is beautiful; the east window especially is much admired for its size, grace, and symmetry. Here are buried some of the Kings of Thomond and their chieftains. The Abbey of Quin is one of the noblest remains of monastic antiquity in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and is in so perfect a state of preservation that little more than a roof is required to make it fit to house the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and have their chant daily re-echo within its walls. It was founded by Sheda McNamara in 1402. In 1641 a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was opened at the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, which soon had eight hundred students. But the most interesting historical remains are to be found at the picturesque little town of Killaloe, the ancient seat of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, which is built on a ridge commanding a fine view of Lough Derg. For here we have the oratory of St. Lua in Friar's Island, the very perfect stone-roofed oratory of St. Flannan, and St. Flannan's <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, built in 1160 by Donald O'Brien, King of <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, near the site of Brian Boroimhe's royal palace of Kincora. St. Flannan's <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was, till the early years of Elizabeth's reign, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the Diocese of Killaloe. Since then it has been in <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> hands. Owing to the cruel <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion and its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in Clare at the opening of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> fell into decay and ruin, the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a> being offered up on some rock on a mountain-side, or some lowly "Mass house." It is only since the time of Catholic Emancipation, a glorious era in the annals of Killaloe when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Clare gave powerful aid to O'Connell to win the Clare election, that a "second spring" has come, and that Thomond has been again covered with handsome and commodious churches.

<p>The first successor of St. Flannan in the Diocese of Killaloe whose name has come down to us, is Cormacan O'Mulcaishel, who died in 1019; and from the death of St. Flannan to the time of the learned O'Lonergain in 1150, the names of only five <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> have been recorded. But from this period the succession becomes regular and complete. In 1179, Constantine O'Brien, fifth in descent from Brian Boroimhe, was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Killaloe; he attended the Council of Lateran. Conor O'Heney, another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Killaloe, also attended the Council of Lateran in 1215. Cornelius Ryan, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friar</a>, and brother of a chieftain, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Killaloe in 1576. He had a remarkable career. From the time of his appointment he used his marked ability and great organizing power in aid of the Earl of Desmond, who championed the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause, and succeeded in obtaining for him the support of <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> and Philip of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. For years he shared in all the perils of the insurrection, and he was regarded by Elizabeth and her minions as a most formidable opponent. When the Desmond insurrection ended in disaster, he escaped to the Continent and died at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> in 1617.

<p>John O'Moloney was another eminent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Killaloe. He was born in Kiltanon, County Clare, in 1617, was a doctor of the Sorbonne and, before his appointment to Killaloe, had been canon of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He was named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> in 1671, at the urgent request of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, his qualifications for the exalted office being set forth in various testimonials from the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, and several <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. In 1673 he was deputed by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to visit <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and endeavour to induce the French king and his minister to found an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> college in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He succeeded in his mission, and a few years later the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> college, of which he is regarded as the founder, was opened. In 1689 he was named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, retaining Killaloe in administration, but he was soon forced to flee to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he died in 1702 at the Sulpician house at Issy, near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is the Most Reverend Dr. Fogarty, born in 1859 near Nenagh, County Tipperary. Before his elevation to the episcopate he was vice-president of <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth College</a>, where he had been for fifteen years previously a distinguished professor of dogmatic and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>. His <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place in 1904, at the procathedral at Ennis, the seat of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and also of a well-equipped <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> college.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> chapter, including dean, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, and canons, was re-established by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on 11 February, 1903. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, 137,574, according to census of 1901; non-Catholic population, 8329; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 57; <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, 142; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> and district churches, 143; houses of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, 2, viz. <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at Ennis, <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> at Roscrea; <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, 12; Convent of Sacred Heart, 1; number in community, 198; <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">monastic houses</a>, 6; number in community, 63.
