<h1>Kimberley in Orange</h1>  

<p>(KYMBERLEYENSIS IN ORANGIA).

<p>The portion of South Africa which at the present day forms the <a href="../cathen/08645a.htm">Vicariate of Kimberley</a> in Orange became in the division of the Vicariate of Good Hope part of the Eastern District, and later on part of the <a href="../cathen/10707a.htm">Vicariate of Natal</a>. In 1886 it became a separate vicariate comprising Basutoland, Griqualand-West, Bechuanaland, and the Orange River Colony (then Free State). On 8 May, 1894, Basutoland was separated and made an independent prefecture. At the present day the vicariate includes the Orange River Colony, Griqualand-West, and Bechuanaland, and since the late Anglo-Boer <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> all this territory is under British rule. The whole vicariate lies between the Tropic of Capricorn and the southernmost point of the Orange River Colony, and between 22 deg. and 30 deg. East Longitude. Before the discovery of diamonds the white population was practically composed of Boers. The number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was insignificant. The towns now in existence were then mere small villages or had no existence at all. But in 1870 Kimberley began to attract attention; diamonds had been first discovered about three years previously by John O'Reilly, and immigration brought to South Africa and especially to Kimberley multitudes of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a>, most of them <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and English. By the time Kimberley was leaping into existence there was already a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in Bloemfontein, Father Hoendervangers of the Order of Saint Norbert, who had followed the troops as military <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> during a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between the British and Boers in 1854. He built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> which was replaced by a new one in 1880. When Father Hoendervangers left Bloemfontein he was replaced by Father Victor Bompart, sent by Dr. Jolivet to minister to the scanty <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population. For some time the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> remained limited to eight or ten. All of them were poor and consequently unable to support the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who very often saw himself on the verge of starvation. However, Father Bompart never swerved from his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>; he was always ready to face sacrifice. His greatest trial was neither starvation nor physical sufferings, but the fruitlessness of the soil he had to cultivate. Being <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to live in the midst of an element prejudiced against anything which might remind them of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and hating the very name of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, his labours were to remain apparently fruitless for several years. The Boers were at that time, as they are now, unwilling to hear of another creed than their own. Their <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> never wearied of railing at and abusing <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Owing to such a spirit conversions have been always few; many prejudices, however, have been overcome by <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> conducted by <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of various orders.

<p>When Kimberley started into existence the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the locality necessitated the frequent visit of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and very soon the establishment of a permanent mission. Fathers Bompart, Lebihan, and Hidien used to visit them occasionally. Father Hidien finally established a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Society and began the erection of a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. A poor and small <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was first erected, but owing to the increase of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregation, a larger and more substantial one was planned and built. Its erection is due to the indefatigable Father Hilary Lenoir, O.M.I. The whole vicariate is greatly indebted to him for all the missions he has founded or helped to found; Kimberley, Mafeking, and Harrismith have, thanks to him, their churches and presbyteries. When, in 1886, a separate vicariate was erected, the Right Reverend Anthony Gaughren, O.M.I., was appointed the first Vicar Apostolic; he was elected in May, 1886, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 10 August, 1886, and died in Kimberley on 15 January, 1901. On 29 January, 1902, his brother, the Right Rev. Matthew Gaughren, O.M.I., was elected to replace him, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tentyra on 16 March, 1902. Under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of these two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the <a href="../cathen/08645a.htm">Vicariate of Kimberley</a> has seen its <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> multiplied. In 1910 the vicariate possesses: 16 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; 19 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (of whom 16 belong to the Order of the <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>); one college under the management of the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, where over 300 boys receive a thorough <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The Sisters of the Holy Family conduct 6 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and 3 boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> have two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, a boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in Mafeking and a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in Vryburg. The Sisters of St. Jacut conduct at Taungs a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for natives. Taungs has been up to the present day the only native mission. It was founded in May, 1898, by Father Porte, O.M.I., and counts over 400 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The total number of children frequenting <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> is at present over 1200. Besides the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, there is in the <a href="../cathen/08645a.htm">Vicariate of Kimberley</a> an establishment for <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and the aged; it is managed by the Sisters of Nazareth. The devotedness and self-sacrifice of these Sisters have not a little contributed to overcome the prejudices of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> who help them generously in the upkeep of their establishment, where over one hundred and fifty children and aged <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are cared for; it may be mentioned that all the primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are in part supported by the Government. Besides the 16 Oblates and the 3 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, 11 <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Christian Brothers (Irish)</a>, 42 Sisters of the Holy Family of Bordeaux, 14 Sisters of Nazareth, 5 Sisters of Saint Jacut, and 12 <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> are carrying out the work of regeneration in the vicariate.

<p>One of the great obstacles to evangelization in this vicariate is caused by the fact of the population being scattered and unsettled. This prevents the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> from being in continual touch with his flock. The small number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> has not permitted an increase of mission work amongst the natives, who far outnumber the white population. At present the mining industry seems to be the only source of material wealth, and its duration is uncertain. In the farming districts, though communication has been facilitated by the construction of railways, the future seems precarious owing to droughts, cattle diseases, locusts, etc. As a consequence the population is unsettled and shifting, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> vocations within the vicariate are hardly to be expected for the present. Catechisms and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> books in the native language have, however, been compiled by Father Porte who made an expedition into Bechuanaland, in 1898, and discovered that the natives, while akin in race and speech to the Basutos, are more rooted in <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">fetishism</a>.
