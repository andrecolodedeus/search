<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Kingdom of W&uuml;rtemberg</h1>  

<p>In area the third and in population the fourth of the states of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. It is situated between <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and Baden. Its area is 7534 sq. miles; in 1910 it had 2,437,574 inhabitants. In 1905 there were 695,808 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 1,583,745 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, 11,107 other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and 12,053 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The capital is Stuttgart. The kingdom is divided into four circles: Neckar (in which 11 per cent of the inhabitants are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>); Black Forest (26 per cent); Jagst (32 per cent); and Danube (62 per cent). The southern part of the country is largely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, as is also the majority of the higher nobility, the members of which were formerly immediate princes of the empire.

<p>The territory includes a part of the old tribal duchy of Alamannia or Swabia (Suevia). The original nucleus of the present kingdom was a Countship of W&uuml;rtemberg, at the junction of the small rivers Rems and Fils with the Neckar. The name <em>W&uuml;rttemberg</em>, originally <em>Wirtenberc</em>, is derived from a castle of the same name on the Roten Berg (red mountain) south of Stuttgart. The first known ancestor of the present ruling <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> is Count Konrad (1081-92); the unbroken succession of rulers began with Count Ulrich I (1241-65). The possessions of the Counts of W&uuml;rtemberg grew steadily larger. Contrary to the custom in other German states, the principle of primogeniture was established at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. Count Eberhard the Bearded (1450-96) was made a duke in 1495 by the Emperor Maximilian I. In 1803 W&uuml;rtemberg received the electoral dignity, and in 1805 <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> raised it to a kingdom. Like the other states of southern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, W&uuml;rtemberg became a member of the Confederation of the Rhine, and until after the battle of Leipzig (1813) it was an ally of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1815 it entered the German Confederation, in 1866 it supported <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. At the close of the Austro-Prussian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> it was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a>, like the other states of South <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, to form an offensive and defensive alliance with <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> was founded in 1871, W&uuml;rtemberg became a member of the confederation, and was granted, like <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, certain special privileges. The present ruler is King William I (b. 1848), who is childless. Since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the royal family has been <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. Duke Charles Alexander (1733-37) had become a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in 1712, when a general in the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> army, before he ascended the throne; he was succeeded in the government successively by his sons, also <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>: Duke Charles Eugene (1737-93), a despot, spendthrift, and profligate, Duke Louis Eugene (1793-95), and Duke Frederick Eugene (1795-97). The last-named duke married a <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> princess, and, through the influence of Frederick the Great of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, permitted his children to be brought up as <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The succession of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> rulers began with Duke <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> (1797-1816), who was made King of W&uuml;rtemberg in 1805 and after that was called Frederick I. On the death of the present king the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> line becomes extinct. The succession to the throne is in a collateral branch descended from Duke Alexander (d. 1833), a brother of the first King of W&uuml;rtemberg. The son of this Alexander, also named Alexander (d. 1881), married a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princess of the Orl&eacute;ans <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and allowed his children to be brought up as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The heir to the throne is a grandson of this latter Alexander, Duke Albert (b. 1865), or, in case of his death, his son Duke Philip Albert (b. 1893). In 1898 a law bearing upon the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> succession to the throne was enacted, which regulated the relations of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> king to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> State Church.

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> spread rapidly in the territory of the present Kingdom of W&uuml;rtemberg in the seventh and eighth centuries. As early as the Roman era it had found a foothold at scattered spots in the second and third centuries, but was not permanently established until the reign of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> (d. 814). The care both of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> and of the entire <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life was exercised by the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, especially by those of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>. Probably the most celebrated <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was that of Hirsau, which was founded about 850 and reorganized to conform to the Rule of Cluny by the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> Blessed Wilhelm (d. 1091). After the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> institution, and in 1692 it was destroyed by the French. Other important <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> were: that at Alpirsbach, in the Kinzigtal, founded in 1095 and existed until 1648; its fine Romanesque <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church is now used by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a>, founded in 764, from 1460 a house of secular <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a> which was directly dependent on the Empire, and which was suppressed in 1803; its fine <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church is in the Romanesque style; the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Murrhardt, founded by the Emperor Louis the Pious, suppressed during the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>; a part of it was the celebrated late Romanesque <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, now used by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, called Walderichskapelle; the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at <a href="../cathen/15576b.htm">Weingarten</a> (1052-1802), the richest <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in Swabia; the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Wiblingen (1093-1806); that at Sweifalten (1089-1803), etc. Two noted <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> which have preserved almost entirely their typical <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> form are: the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Maulbron, founded in 1146, became a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in 1556, and the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Bebenhausen, founded in 1185, made a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in 1560, and since 1807 a royal hunting castle. Among the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life in the cities during the era before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> are some of the celebrated monuments of <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic architecture</a>, as: the minster at Ulm, now used by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, which next to Cologne <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is the largest church building in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and has an area of about 75,778 sq. feet; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Holy Cross and of Our Lady, at Schw&auml;bisch-Gmund, without a tower; and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Our lady at Reutlingen, now used by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Among the noted <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> of a later date special mention should be made of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/13207b.htm">Rottenburg</a> (seventeenth century), and the church at <a href="../cathen/15576b.htm">Weingarten</a>, a structure of the eighteenth century in the <a href="../cathen/02303b.htm">baroque style</a>. This latter church is distinguished for a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the Holy Blood, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of which a large equestrian procession, called the <em>Blutritt</em>, is held annually on the Friday after <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension Day</a>.



<p>As early as the years 1520-30 the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> found entrance into W&uuml;rtemberg. The extravagance and cruelty of a number of the rulers and the harsh oppression of the people had led to several fierce <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with the cities and revolts of the peasantry; all this prepared the way for the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Duke Ulrich (1498-1550), who had been driven from the country on account of his acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and had been put under the ban of the empire in 1519 for <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, became a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. With the aid of Landgrave Philip of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, who is well known on account of his two <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, Ulrich acquired possession of his territories once more, and introduced the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> throughout them, while at the same time he confiscated all the lands of the churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The work of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was completed by Ulrich's son Duke Christopher (1550-1568). W&uuml;rtemberg suffered terribly in the great religious struggle known as the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>. At the beginning of the nineteenth century it had an area of 2093 sq. miles and 650,000 inhabitants. Owing to the great changes brought about in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, W&uuml;rtemberg obtained during the years 1802-1810 an increase of population that doubled the number of its inhabitants and an increase of territory that gave the country its present extent. This increase added <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> districts once more to the state, which up to then had been entirely <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. The additions were, mainly, a large part of the Austrian possessions in Swabia, the lands of the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a>, which up till then had been held immediately from the empire, the lands belonging to the provostship of <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a>, the lands of various <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which had held their territories directly from the empire, etc. A state board called the spiritual council was at once appointed to protect the sovereign <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the State as against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; since 1816 this board has been called the church council. The newly acquired <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> districts, however, belonged to different <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, Wurzburg, and Speyer, consequently a vicar-generalate was created which was provided with a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty at <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a>. In 1817, however, the office of the vicariate general and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were transferred to <a href="../cathen/13207b.htm">Rottenburg</a>, where they were established in the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of that place, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty was united with the <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">University of T&uuml;bingen</a>.

<p>On 16 Aug., 1821, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> "Provida sollersque" erected the new <a href="../cathen/13207b.htm">Diocese of Rottenburg</a> for the entire territory of W&uuml;rtemberg; it was united with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> province of the Upper Rhine and was made suffragan to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ad dominici gregis custodiam", of 11 April, 1827, regulated the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the appointment of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canons, and in 1828 <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> von-Keller was <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The list of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is: Johann Baptist von Keller (d. 1845), Joseph von Lipp (d. 1869), Karl Joseph von Hefele (d. 1893), William von Reiser (d. 1898), Franz Xaver von Linsenmann (d. 1898); since 18 Jan., 1899, Paul Wilhelm von Kepler (b. 1852; <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 1875). During the decade of 1840 a dispute arose between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the State concerning the limits of the State's <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of sovereignty and supervision. In 1854 the Government made an agreement with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> which, however, was not recognized by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. A concordat between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the kingdom, which was made in 1857, was not accepted by the Diet. After this the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 30 Jan., 1862, made a one-sided adjustment of the relations between State and Church. In most particulars this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> repeated the contents of the Concordat, so that up to now actual conflict has been avoided. W&uuml;rtemberg was spared the violent conflict between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, known as the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em>, which raged in almost all of the German countries of the empire during the years directly following 1870. This peace was due to the kindliness of the king, the good sense of the Government, and the moderate position taken by the Diet. It is only of late years that religious differences have become more evident in political life. Much is said in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> of W&uuml;rtemberg of the <a href="../cathen/13207b.htm">Rottenburg</a> dispute. This was a quarrel between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, and the director of the Wilhelm School at <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a> on the one side, and the heads of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and a large body of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> on the other side, as to the religious, scholarly, and moral training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The matter was settled by the intervention of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>The relations between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> are regulated by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 30 Jan., 1862. Both the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> appointed by him received the rank of nobles. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is elected from among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, which consists of a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> dean and six canons; the list of candidates is first handed to the ruler, who strikes off the names of the most distasteful to him. The members of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter are selected alternately by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or chapter, the ruler having the same <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as in the election of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The governmental right of supervision (<em>jus circa sacra</em>) is exercised by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> council, a board subordinate to the ministry of worship and consisting of secular and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> members, which is appointed by the Government. General ordinances issued by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> that are not purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> in character, and <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a>, Briefs, etc., which touch upon governmental or civil affairs, are subject to the approval of the State. Episcopal or <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decrees in regard to purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters need only to be submitted to the State authorities for inspection at the time of their <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a>. For admission to an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> office the candidate must have the civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of a citizen of W&uuml;rtemberg, must have attended a gymnasium, have studied at the <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">University of T&uuml;bingen</a>, and have passed the final examination of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty there. For the training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> there are <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> for boys connected with the gymnasium at Ehingen and Rottweil, and the Wilhelm School at <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a> for the students of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">University of T&uuml;bingen</a>. These three <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are supported by the State. In these institutions the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> directs the religious training under the supervision of the State; in other respects they are under the direct control of the Government, which is exercised through the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> council. In particular, the council controls the reception and dismissal of the pupils. The director and his assistants, called <em>repetents</em>, are appointed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. After passing the final <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> examination at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, which comes at the close of a four-years course in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, the candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> are sent to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at <a href="../cathen/13207b.htm">Rottenburg</a>, which is controlled by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> alone. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> also has charge of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religious instruction in all <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.

<p>The consent of the State, which can be recalled at any moment, is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the admission of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and congregations and for every new house of an order or congregation. The State treats the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of the members of the orders as revocable. Up to the present time only <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> orders have been permitted in W&uuml;rtemberg. The largest number of houses (about 130) belong to the <a href="../cathen/03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a>, the mother-house being at Untermarchtal; the Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis has over 100 houses, the mother-house being at Reute. Up to now the Government has not granted the repeated requests of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> portion of the population for the admission of male orders. The State granted the diocese an endowment from the former <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>, e.g. in houses, lands, and revenues in money; this <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> is administered by the episcopal court under the supervision of the Government. The sustentation fund established in 1808 received definite sums from the revenues of vacant <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> positions; these amount serve to supplement the salaries of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, to pension retired <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, etc. The fund is administered by the Government and Church together. The administration of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the local churches is also regulated by the State (laws of 14 June, 1887, and of 27 July, 1906). A definite allowance is added from the state treasury to the incomes of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from their <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>; in 1911 the total amount of state aid was fixed at 225,000 marks annually. Measures are being taken for the reorganization of the financial relations between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. In 1910 the number of churches, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and stations was 1031, of these 698 were <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; there were 1179 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 29 deaneries. The primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are denominational. When the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in a commune falls below 60 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> must support a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> out of their own means. The spiritual supervision of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> was greatly limited in 1903 and 1909. Of the higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> 4 classical gymnasia and 1 gymnasium with scientific instead of Classical courses are entirely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. All <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are under a special government board, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> higher <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> council. There are a number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> for poor, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphaned</a>, and sick <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children; these institutions are generally conducted by members of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> orders, as is also a government institution, the royal <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> at Oxenhausen. Religious fraternities and <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> are numerous.
