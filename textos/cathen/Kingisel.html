<h1>Kingisel</h1>  

<p>The name of two <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> who ruled Glastonbury in the seventh and eighth centuries respectively.
<h2>Kingisel I</h2>

<p>Kingisel I, whose name also appears as Hemgisel, Hengislus, and Hanigestus, became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> in A.D. 678. According to <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a> it was during his first year of office that King Kentwine granted six hides to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> upon condition that the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> should always have the right of freely electing their <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> according to the Rule of Saint Benedict. In 681 King Baldred granted to him and his successors the manor of Pennard near Glastonbury. In this charter, which is given by Dugdale from the Ashmolean <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> name is spelled differently in two sentences, a slip which has led Bishop Tanner (Notitia Monastica) and <a href="../cathen/05736b.htm">Mr. Eyston</a> (Little Monument) to suppose that two different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were referred to. It was during the reign of this <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> that King Ina began his series of munificent benefactions to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Kingisel I died in the year 705 and was succeeded by Berwald.
<h2>Kingisel II</h2>

<p>Kingisel II, whose name is also found as Cingislus, Cengillus, and Hengissingus, was apparently fourth <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> after his namesake; he succeeded to the position in the year 729 and died in 744. <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a> states that Ina's successor, Edelard, made him grants of land, and the Ashmolean <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> gives a charter of Cudred, or Cuthred, King of the West Saxons, which confirms to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> all the previous grants made to it. In this charter the name is spelled Hengisilus. His successor was Cumbertus. Almost the only record of these <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> consists in the various charters in which they are named. The question as to the genuineness of these early charters is a difficult one, but it may be safely said that at the present day the general trend of opinion is more favourable to them than was the case in 1826, at which date, however, Warner, in his "History of the Abbey of Glaston," wrote concerning Ina's charter, "The reasons for questioning its genuineness do not appear to be serious." (See also <a href="../cathen/06579a.htm">GLASTONBURY ABBEY</a>).
