<p>(KINGSTONIENSIS or REGIOPOLITANA)

<p>The Archdiocese of Kingston comprises the territory from the eastern line of Dundas County to the western boundary of Hastings County in the <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Province of Ontario</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and includes the Counties of Addington, Dundas, Frontenac, Grenville, Hastings, Lanark, <a href="../cathen/09112a.htm">Leeds</a>, Lennox, and Prince Edward. The territory of the present archdiocese was a portion of the old Diocese of Quebec. In 1817 the Diocese of Quebec was erected into an archdiocese, the western portion, Upper <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, now the <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Province of Ontario</a>, being made a vicariate, and the Rev. Alexander Macdonell, Pastor at St. Raphael, Glengarry, since 1804, was nominated first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the district. His <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place on 31 December, 1820, in the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at Quebec. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> continued to reside for some years at St. Raphael which thus became the first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> in the new province and the second established in all <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. It was to Glengarry that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> brought, in 1803 and 1804, the members of the famous Highland <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> regiment of Glengarry Fencibles, disbanded in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> in 1802. In 1804, to minister to the scattered <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlers and Indians in the vast Province of Upper <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, there were but two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the Rev. Alexander Macdonell (afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>) and an assistant. About 1816 the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had increased to six, two at St. Raphael, one at Perth, one at Kingston, and two at Sandwich. The vicariate was created a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Pope Leo XII</a> in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 27 January, 1826, and Kingston was named the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. It was the first diocese established in a British colony since the so-called <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. In this year Bishop Macdonell applied for a coadjutor, and the Rev. Thomas Weld, an <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Amycla and coadjutor of Upper <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> on 6 August, 1826. The state of his health did not permit Bishop Weld to come to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. He remained some years in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and, going to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a> in 1830.

<p>The beginning of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was made at St. Raphael, where Bishop Macdonell established the College of <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a>, under the direction of Rev. William P. Macdonald, afterwards <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> for twenty years. He was also the editor of "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>," the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journal published in the English language in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. It was a vigorous polemical weekly, and was issued at Kingston in 1830-31, and at <a href="../cathen/07123a.htm">Hamilton</a> from 1841 to 1844.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had resided at <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, now Toronto, for some years, and came to Kingston in 1836. One of his earliest acts was to obtain from the Legislature an Act of Incorporation for the Regiopolis College at Kingston. The cornerstone of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was laid on 11 June, 1838. This building is now used as a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> by the Sisters of the H&ocirc;tel Dieu. The college became a famous seat of learning, and continued its usefulness till 1869, when it was temporarily closed. On another site in the city, Regiopolis College was reestablished by the late Archbishop Cleary, and is now in a flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> under the presidency of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, the Most Reverend Dr. Gauthier. A new coadjutor was appointed in 1833 in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Rev. Remigius Gaulin, who became the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Kingston on the death of Bishop Macdonell in 1840. At this date (1840) there were 48 churches in the diocese. The western region was erected into the <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Diocese of Toronto</a> in 1841, and the eastern territory, the Diocese of Ottawa (Bytown), was formed in 1848. Bishop Gaulin died on 8 May, 1857, and the Right Rev. Patrick Phelan, who had been his administrator since 1852, was placed in charge of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Bishop Phelan's episcopate lasted but one month, as he died on 6 June following, and the Rt. Rev. Edward J. Horan succeeded him. Under Bishop Horan the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was enriched with many valuable charitable and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>, but sickness and growing infirmities compelled him to resign his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> shortly before his death (15 Feb., 1875), to make way for the Rt. Rev. John O'Brien, whose episcopate lasted till 1 Aug., 1879. The rapidly increasing numbers of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> inhabitants necessitated another division of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and in 1874 the Vicariate Apostolic of Northern <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> was erected, to become, in its turn, the <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Diocese of Peterborough</a>, in 1882. The Right Rev. J.V. Cleary, at one time president of St. John's College, Waterford, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 21 Nov., 1880, to succeed Bishop O'Brien, and when the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was made an archdiocese by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 28 July, 1889, he became the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. With the formation of the archdiocese the Counties of Glengarry, Stormont, and Cornwall were separated from the Diocese of Kingston, erected into the separate <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Diocese of Alexandria</a>, which, with the <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Diocese of Peterborough</a>, became suffragan of Kingston. In the incumbency of the present <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, the Most Rev. Charles H. Gauthier, the suffragan Diocese of Sault Ste. Marie has been added (16 Sept., 1904).

<p>The capital city of the archdiocese is Kingston. A gathering ground of old for the neighboring <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indian tribes</a>, it was made the seat of Government in 1841 on the union of the two Canadas, and remained such for four years. The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception is located there, as is Regiopolis College, also two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls, with an attendance of 314, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys, with 250 pupils, a mother-house of the Sisters of Charity of Providence, with 140 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, which cares for 300 old and infirm, as well as an annexed <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>. The H&ocirc;tel Dieu and Orphan Asylum, in charge of the Hospital <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, has charge of 45 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> girls, and there is a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Sisters of Notre Dame with 139 pupils. Schools are also maintained by the Sisters of Charity of Providence at <a href="../cathen/02414c.htm">Belleville</a>, 400 pupils; Brockville, 250 pupils; Chesterville, 70 pupils; Perth, 230 pupils; Prescott, 300 pupils; and Trenton, 180 pupils. These sisters have also established <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> at Brockville and Smith's Falls. The Sisters of Notre Dame are in charge of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at Brockville, 170 pupils, and Westport, 147 pupils. The Archdiocese of Kingston now has 38 churches with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 22 missions with churches; 61 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 54 secular and 7 of the Fathers of the Congregation of Mary; 1 college for boys, with 100 students; 3 academies for young ladies, with 295 pupils; 46 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with 6500 pupils; 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, with 85 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>; 3 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the archdiocese approximates 43,000. (See <a href="../cathen/09489b.htm">ALEXANDER MACDONELL</a>.)
