<h1>Knights of the Cross</h1>  

<p>(Ordo Militaris Crucigerorum cum Rubea Stella.)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order famous in the history of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, and accustomed from the beginning to the use of arms, a custom which was confirmed in 1292 by an ambassador of <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Pope Nicholas IV</a>. The grand master is still invested with a sword at his induction into office, and the congregation has been recognized as a <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military order</a> by Popes <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a> and <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a>, as well as by several emperors.

<p>There is much discussion as to the real beginnings of this order, some authorities, among others the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, tracing it back to Palestine, where the first members were supposed to have borne arms against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. On the other hand, however, is the contemporary custom of establishing a religious congregation at the time of the foundation of a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, as well as the fact that in no document is there any trace of the Palestinian Cruciferi having gone to <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. Moreover, in a parchment <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> of the order <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1356 the account of foundation contains no allusion to such a lineage. The order is first found in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> as a fraternity attached to a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at Prague under a community of Clarisses, established by Princess Agnes, daughter of Przemysl Ottokar I and Queen Constantia, in 1233. In 1235 the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> was richly endowed by the queen with <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> formerly belonging to the German order, a gift confirmed by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Pope Gregory IX</a> (18 May, 1236), who stipulated that the revenues should be divided with the Clarisse <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. After three years, during which the head of the congregation had gone to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as the accredited representative of <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> Agnes, and the congregation had been formally constituted an order under the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a> by Gregory IX (1238), the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> (1239) resigned all <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and its possessions into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Twelve days later the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> formally assigned these to the recently confirmed Knights of the Cross, who were to hold them forever in fief to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, on condition of the yearly payment of a nominal sum. Blessed Agnes for the order a new <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at the Prague Bridge, which was taken as the mother-house, and to the title of the order was added <em>in latere (pede) pontis (Pragenis)</em> [at the foot of the (Prague) bridge]. She also petitioned the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for some mark to distinguish these <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> from other Cruciferi, with whom they bore in common the red <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusader</a>. To this was added by Bishop Nicholas of Prague, on the authorization of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, a red six-pointed star (10 Oct., 1250), probably from the arms of the first general, Albrecht von Sternberg.

<p>The order, which by 1253 had extensive possessions in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, soon spread to neighbouring lands. The Breslau house in particular was the centre of many other foundations. It is <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, in an especial manner, to which the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> have rendered incalculable services. Their success in <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> work is evidenced by the rapidity with which their houses multiplied, and the frequent testimony borne to it in documents of kings and emperors. Within two decades after their foundation the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> had become as important as their <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> work, so quickly had the majority of <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> been replaced by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Numberless churches were entrusted to them in all parts of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, particularly the West, where they formed a bulwark of the Faith during the ravages of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in that region; the Taborites <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Stephen's at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> destroyed the mother-house and brought the order almost to the point of dissolution, but it recovered sufficiently to the offer strenuous resistance to the advance of the Reformed teachings. In the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Sweden the members of the order justified their claim to the title of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> during the siege of Eger, fighting side by side with the townspeople, and sharing with them their last crust. Their <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at Prague was also the first refuge of other orders who came to work for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, among others the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (1555) and <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> (1599). For almost a hundred and fifty years the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Prague held the post of grand master and were supported almost entirely by the revenues of the order. Only on the restoration of the possessions of the archdiocese at the end of the seventeenth century was the grand master again elected from among the members, and a general reform instituted. George Ignatius Paspichal (1694-99), the first grand master under the new regime, showed great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the restoration of the primitive ideals, especially that of charity. Even to the present day the Prague <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> supports twelve pensioners and distributes the so-called "hospital portion" to forty poor.

<p>Many <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> have won enviable reputations in the world of learning, among others Nicholas Kozarz Kozarowa (d. 1592), celebrated mathematician and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>: John Francis Bekowsk (d. 1725), who established at Prague an herbarium which is still in existence, and Zimmermann, the historian.

<p>At the present time, besides the mother-house at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, there are about 26 incorporated <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 85 professed members, several of whom are engaged in gymnasia and the <a href="../cathen/12342a.htm">University of Prague</a>. There are <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> at Hadrisk, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where the order has been established since the thirteenth century, Eger, Br&uuml;x, and Schaab.
