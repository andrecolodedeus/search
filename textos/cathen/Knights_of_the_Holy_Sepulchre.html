<h1>Knights of the Holy Sepulchre</h1>  

<p>Neither the name of a founder nor a date of foundation can be assigned to the so-called Order of the Holy Sepulchre if we reject the legendary traditions which trace its origin back to the time of <a href="../cathen/06624b.htm">Godfrey of Bouillon</a>, or <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, or indeed even to the days of St. James the Apostle, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. It is in reality a secular confraternity which gradually grew up around the most august of the Holy Places. It was for the deliverance of the Holy Sepulchre that the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a> were organized; it was for its defence that <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a> were instituted. During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> this memorable <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> life on earth was looked upon as the mystical sovereign of the new Latin state. <a href="../cathen/06624b.htm">Godfrey of Bouillon</a> desired no other title than that of Defender of the Holy Sepulchre, and different Latin princes, Bohemond of Antioch, and Tancred, acknowledged themselves its vassals. It was natural that the Holy Sepulchre also had its special <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>. In the broad acceptation of the word, every <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusader</a> who had taken the sword in its defence might assume the title from the very moment of being dubbed a <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a>. Those who were not knighted had the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of being decorated <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, preferably in this sanctuary, and of being thus enabled to style themselves Knights of the Holy Sepulchre <em>par excellence</em>. The fall of the <a href="../cathen/08361a.htm">Kingdom of Jerusalem</a> did not suspend <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to the Tomb of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or the custom of receiving knighthood there, and, when the custody of the Holy Land was entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, they continued this <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> custom and gave the order its first grand masters.

<p>The official arrival of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> dates from the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> addressed by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Pope Gregory IX</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Palestine in 1230, charging them to welcome the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>, and to allow them to preach to the faithful and hold <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> and cemeteries of their own. Thanks to the ten years' truce concluded during the preceding year between <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and the sultan, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> were enabled to enter <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, but they were also the first victims of the violent invasion of the Khorasmians in 1244, thus opening the long <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> of the Holy Land. Nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> province of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> continued to exist with Acco as its seat. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> quickly resumed possession of their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Mount Sion at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, to which they have demonstrated their claim with the blood of their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and where they have obstinately retained their foothold in spite of numberless molestations and outrages for five hundred years. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, notwithstanding their fierce fanaticism, tolerated the veneration paid to the Tomb of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because of the revenue they derived from the taxes levied upon <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. In 1342, in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Gratiam agimus", <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Pope Clement VI</a> officially committed the care of the Holy Land to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who fulfilled this trust until the restoration of the Latin Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. Consequently, after 1342, to be enrolled among the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to apply to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and from this period the itineraries of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> mention frequent receptions into this confraternity &mdash; improperly called an order, since it had no monastic rule, regular organization, or community of goods. Where mention is made of the possessions of the Holy Sepulchre, the allusion is to the Canons of the Holy Sepulchre, who had <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in various lands, and not to the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, as some writers believe.

<p>Pilgrims were received into this lay confraternity with all the external ceremonial of ancient <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">chivalry</a>, although the fundamental rules of the institution were not always observed. It was objected that many on whom knighthood was conferred were not of the nobility. The formal question, "if he were of noble birth", was always put to the applicant, but in event of his being a merchant or a plebeian he was not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to answer. In point of fact all classes were represented in these <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a>, and it is easy to understand why those who had accomplished this trying devotion, then so fraught with danger, should desire to carry away from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> some such lasting souvenir as the insignia of knighthood, and that refusal was difficult, especially since the sanctuary was practically dependent on the offerings of these merchants, and consequently these contributions were far more deserving of recognition than the platonic <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to exert oneself as far as possible in the defence of the Holy Land. In the ceremonial of reception, the r&ocirc;le of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was limited to the <em>benedictio militis</em>, the final act of dubbing with the sword being reserved to a professional <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a>. It has been ascertained that, in the fifteenth century from 1480 to 1495, there was in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> a German, John of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, who acted as steward for the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and who, in his character of gentleman and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, regularly discharged this act reserved to knighthood. It was also of frequent occurrence that a foreign <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a>, present among the crowds of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, would assist at this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. However, in default of other assistance, it was the superior who had to act instead of a <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a>, although such a course was esteemed irregular, since the carrying of the sword was incompatible with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> character. It was since then also that the superior of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> assumed the title of grand master, a title which has been acknowledged by various pontifical diplomas, and finally by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1746. When <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> re-established the Latin Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in 1847, he transferred to it the office of grand master of the order. At the same time he drew up and in 1868 published the new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the order, which created the three ranks &mdash; that of the grand cross, that of commander, and that of simple <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> &mdash; ordained that the costume be a "white cloak with the cross of Jerusalem in red enamel", and regulated the chancellor's fees. By his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 30 May, 1907, <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> effected the latest change by reserving to himself the grand-mastership of the order, but delegating his powers to the present Latin patriarch.
