<h1>Knowledge of Jesus Christ</h1>  

<p>"Knowledge of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>," as used in this article, does not mean a summary of what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> about <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, but a survey of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> endowment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> possessing two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, and therefore two <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellects</a>, the human and the Divine, the question as to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> found in His Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is identical with the question concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, held that the Word Himself was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of many things, for instance, of the day of <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment</a>; in this they were consistent with their denial that the Word was <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">consubstantial</a> with the Omniscient <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01215b.htm">Agnoetae</a>, too, attributed <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> not merely to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but to the Eternal Word. Suicer, s.v. <em>Agnoetai</em>, I, p. 65, says: "Hi docebant divinam Christi naturam . . .quaedam ignorasse, ut horam extremi judicii". But then, the <a href="../cathen/01215b.htm">Agnoetae</a> were a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, and imagined a confusion of natures in Christ, after the <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">Eutychian</a> pattern, so as to attribute <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to that Divine nature into which His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (as they held) was absorbed. An honest profession of the Divinity of Christ necessitates the admission of omniscience in His Divine <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Kinds of knowledge in Christ's human intellect</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Man-God</a> possessed, not merely a Divine, but also a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and therefore a human <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> possessed by this <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> we are here mainly concerned. The integrity of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> implies <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> cognition by acts of its human <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> might be wise by the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; yet the humanity of Christ knows by its own <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> act. If we except <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a>, all <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> teach that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Christ is elevated to participation in the Divine wisdom by an infusion of Divine light. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Christ enjoyed from the very beginning the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>; it was endowed with infused <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and it acquired in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> experimental <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.
<h3 id="A">The beatific vision</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a> (De Incarnatione, I, xii, c. 4) maintains that there is no controversy among <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologians</a>, or even among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, as to the fact that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was endowed with the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> (see <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">H<font size=-2>EAVEN</font></a>) from the beginning of its existence. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately in His essence, or, in other words, beheld Him face to face as the blessed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. The great <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> freely grant that this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is not stated in so many words in the books of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>, nor even in the writing of the early Fathers; but recent masters in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> do not hesitate to consider the contrary opinion as rash, though it was upheld by the pretended <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of G&uuml;nther. The basis for the privilege of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> enjoyed by the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Christ is its <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">Hypostatic Union</a> with the Word. This union implies a plenitude of grace and of gifts in both <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and will. Such a fullness does not exist without the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>. Again, by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">Hypostatic Union</a> the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Christ is assumed into a unity of Divine <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; it does not appear how such a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> could at the same time remain, like ordinary <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human beings</a>, destitute of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a> to which they hope to attain only after their stay on earth is over. Once more, by virtue of the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">Hypostatic Union</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, even as man, was the natural son of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not a merely adoptive child; now, it would not be right to debar a deserving son from seeing the face of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, an incongruity that would have taken place in the case of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, if His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had been bereft of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>. And all these reasons show that the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Christ must have seen <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> face to face from the very first moment of its creation.

<p>Though Scripture does not state in explicit terms that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was favoured with the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>, still it contains passages that imply this privilege: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> speaks as an eyewitness of things Divine (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs11">John 3:11, sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs18">1:18</a>; <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs31">1:31 sq.</a>); any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> inferior to immediate vision is imperfect and unworthy of Christ (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#vrs9">1 Corinthians 13:9-12</a>); <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> repeatedly asserts that He knows the Father and is known by Him, that He knows what the Father knows. There is a difficulty in reconciling <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's sufferings</a> and surpassing great sorrow with the beatitude implied in His <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>. But if the Word could be united with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Christ without allowing Its glory to overflow into His sacred body, the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> too might be in the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of our Lord without overflowing into and absorbing His lower faculties, so that He might feel the pangs of sorrow and suffering. The same faculty may be simultaneously affected by sorrow and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, resulting from the perception of different objects (cf. St. Thomas, III, Q. xiii, a. 5, ad 3; St. Bonav., in III, dist. xvi, a. 2, q. 2); the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> have often testified to the ecstatic <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> filled their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, at the very time that their bodies were suffering the extremity of torment.

<h3 id="B">Christ's infused knowledge</h3>

<p>The existence of an infused <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> in the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> may perhaps be less certain, from a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> point of view, than His continual and original fruition of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>; still, it is almost universally admitted that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> infused into <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> human <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> similar in kind to that of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. This is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is not acquired gradually by experience, but is poured into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in one flood. This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> rests on <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> grounds: the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Man-God</a> must have possessed all perfections except such as would be incompatible with His <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or hope; or with His sinlessness, as penance; or again, with His office of Redeemer, which would be incompatible with the consummation of His glory. Now, infused <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not incompatible with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>, not with His sinlessness, not again with His office of Redeemer. Besides, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Christ is the first and most perfect of all created spirits, and cannot be deprived of a privilege granted to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Moreover, a created <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is simply perfect only when, besides the vision of things in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it has a vision of things in themselves; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only sees all things comprehensively in Himself. The <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">God-Man</a>, besides seeing them in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, would also perceive and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them by His human <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. Finally, <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> favours the existence of such infused <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the human <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of Christ: <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> speaks of all the treasures of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> wisdom and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> hidden in Christ (<a href="../bible/col002.htm#vrs3">Colossians 2:3</a>); Isaias speaks of the spirit of wisdom and counsel, of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and understanding, resting on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> (<a href="../bible/isa011.htm#vrs2">Isaiah 11:2</a>); St. John intimates that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not given His Spirit by measure to His Divine envoy (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs34">John 3:34</a>); St. Matthew represents Christ as our sovereign teacher (<a href="../bible/mat023.htm#vrs10">Matthew 23:10</a>). Beside the Divine and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, most <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> admit in the human <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> infused <em>per accidens</em>, i.e., an extraordinary comprehension of things which might be learned in the ordinary way, similar to that granted to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> (cf. St. Thomas, III., Q. i, a. 2; QQ. viii-xii; Q. xv, a. 2).
<h3 id="C">Christ's acquired knowedge</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> had, no doubt, also an experimental <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> acquired by the natural use of His faculties, through His senses and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, just as happens in the case of common <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. To say that his human faculties were wholly inactive would resemble a profession of either <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a> or of <a href="../cathen/05070c.htm">Docetism</a>. This <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> naturally grew in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in the process of time, according to the words of <a href="../bible/luk002.htm">Luke 2:52</a>: "And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> advanced in wisdom, and age, and grace with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>". Understood in this way, the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> speaks not merely of a successively greater manifestation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Divine and infused <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, nor merely of an increase in His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as far as outward effects were concerned, but of a real advance in His acquired <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Not that this kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> implies an enlarged object of His <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>; but it signified that He gradually came to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, after a merely human way, some of the things which he had known from the beginning by His Divine and infused <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Extent of the knowledge of Jesus Christ</h2>

<p>It has already been stated that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Divine nature is co-extensive with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Omniscience. As to the experimental <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> acquired by Christ, it must have been at least equal to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the most gifted of men; it appears to us wholly unworthy of the dignity of Christ that His powers of observation and natural insight should have been less than those of other naturally perfect men. But the main difficulty arises from the question as to the extent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> flowing from His <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>, and of His infused amount of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p>(1) The <a href="../cathen/02334b.htm">Council of Basle</a> (Sess. XXII) condemned the proposition of a certain Augustinus de Roma: "Anima Christi videt Deum tam clare. Et intense quam clare et intense Deus videt seipsum" (The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Christ sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as clearly and intimately as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> perceives Himself). It is quite clear that, however perfect the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Christ is, it always remains finite and limited; hence its <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> cannot be unlimited and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>.

<p>(2) Though the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Christ was not <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, it was most perfect and embraced the widest range, extending to the Divine <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> already realized, or still to be realized. Nescience of any of these matters would amount to positive <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in Christ, as the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of law in a judge. For Christ is not merely our <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> teacher, but also the universal mediator, the supreme judge, the sovereign king of all creation.

<p>(3) Two important texts are urged against this perfection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: <a href="../bible/luk002.htm">Luke 2:52</a> demands an advancement in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the case of Christ; this text has already been considered in the last paragraph. The other text is <a href="../bible/mar013.htm#vrs32">Mark 13:32</a>: "Of that day or hour no man knoweth, neither the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, nor the Son, but the Father." After all that has been written on this question in recent years, we see no need to add anything to the traditional explanations: the Son has no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the judgment day which He may communicate; or, the Son has no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this event, which spring from His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as such, or again, the Son has no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the day and the hour, that has not been communicated to Him by the Father. (See Mangenot in Vigouroux, "Dict. de la Bible", II, Paris, 1899, 2268 sqq.)

<p>Since the time of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> controversies, <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a> has been practically unanimous as to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Christ (cf. Leporius, "Libellus Emendationis", n. 40; Eulogius Alex., "in Phot.", cod. 230, n. 10; S. Gregorius Magnus, lib. X, ep. xxxv, xxxix; Sophron., "Ep. Syn. ad Sergium"; Damascenus, "De Haer., " n. 85; Nat. Alex., "Hist. Eccl. in saec. sext.", n. 85). As to the Fathers preceding the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> controversy, <a href="../cathen/09180a.htm">Leontius Byzantinus</a> simply surrenders their authority to the opponents of our <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Christ; <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a> represents it as partly undecided; but the early Fathers may be excused from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, because they wrote mostly against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian heresy</a>, so that they endeavoured to establish <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Divinity by removing all <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> from His Divine nature, while they did not care to enter upon an <em>ex professo</em> investigation of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> possessed by His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. At that time there was no call for any such study. After the patristic period, Fulgentius (Resp. ad quaest. tert. Ferrandi) and <a href="../cathen/07521c.htm">Hugh of St. Victor</a> exaggerated the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so that the early <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> asked the question, why <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Omniscience was incommunicable (Lomb., "Liber Sent.", III, d. 14). But even at this period, at least a modal difference was admitted to exist between the Omniscience of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Christ (cf. Bonav. in III., dist. 13, a. 2). Soon, however, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> began to limit the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Christ to the range of the <em>scientia visionis</em> or of all that actually has been, is, or will be, while <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Omniscience embraces also the range of the possibilities.
