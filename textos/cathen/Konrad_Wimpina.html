<h1>Konrad Wimpina</h1>  

<p>(WIMINAE, WIMINESIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a>, b. at Buchen in <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, about 1465; d. at <a href="../cathen/01433a.htm">Amorbach</a> in Lower Franconia, 17 May, 1531. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, whose name was Koch, came from Wimpfen on the Neckar, hence he was called Wimpina. He matriculated at the <a href="../cathen/09140a.htm">University of Leipzig</a> (1479-80) and remained there until 1505; in 1481 he obtained the baccalaureate degree, and in 1485 was made <em>magister.</em> He was a pupil of Martin Polich of Mellerstadt and an adherent of <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> philosophy. In 1491 he was made a member of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculty, in 1494 <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, and in 1494-95 dean. Having taken the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course, he was made cursor in 1491 and <em>sententiarius</em> in 1494; in 1502 he received the degree of licentiate. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at Wurzburg, in 1495, as <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, about 1500 as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He received the degree of Doctor of Theology from Cardinal-Legate Perandi at <a href="../cathen/09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, 1503. In 1505 Elector Joachim I of Brandenburg called Wimpina to Frankfort-on-the-Oder to organize the new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and to be its first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>; he was several times dean of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty. He received <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonries</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of Brandenburg and Havelberg, and in 1530 took part in the Diet of Augsburg as <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the Elector Joachim, whom he accompanied to Cologne for the election of King Ferdinand. He then retired to his native land.

<p>His first publication, "Ars epistolandi" (1486), and a poem in praise of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and city of Leipzig (1488) are of little importance. In 1493 Wimpina showed in the "Tractatus de erroribus philosophorum" that <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> was wrong in various propositions which disagreed with <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. As <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> he delivered several orations that show wide reading. From 1500-04, in a dispute with his former instructor Polich, Wimpina defended <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and Polich poetry, each attaching the other with exaggerated and personal abuse. Wimpina was one of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> first opponents. In 1518 he defended the legend that <a href="../cathen/01538a.htm">St. Anne</a> had three husbands in succession and had a child Mary, by each one of them (De d. Annae trinubio), against Sylvius Egranus, in whose defence <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> took part. In the dispute over <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> Wimpina composed the theses which Johann <a href="../cathen/14539a.htm">Tetzel</a> debated at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, 20 January, 1518. These theses contained the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but on the question of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> for the dead maintained merely a <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> opinion, preached by <a href="../cathen/14539a.htm">Tetzel</a>. He also wrote a series of treatises and held disputations against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. His polemics are combined in the "Anacephalaeosis" (1528), one of the most complete refutations of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. In that age of pamphlets the work did not receive the attention it deserved. At the Diet of Augsburg Wimina, Mensing, Redorfer, and Elgersma drew up, against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> seventeen Swabian articles, the "Christlichen Unterricht gegen die Bekanntnus M. Luthers". Wimpina was commissioned to confute the "Confessio Augustana", and took part in the disputation about reunion. He was conservative, quiet, of unimpeachable character, immovable in his convictions, but somewhat petty by nature.
