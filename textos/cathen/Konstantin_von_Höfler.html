<h1>Konstantin von H&ouml;fler</h1>  

<p>An historian; born at Memmingen, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, 26 March, 1811; died at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, 29 December, 1898. After finishing his studies in the gymnasia at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> and Landshut, he studied first <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> and then history at the University of Munich under G&ouml;rres, <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, and especially Schelling, and received his degree in 1831 on presenting the dissertation "Ueber die Anf&auml;nge der griechischen Geschichte". Aided by a pension from the government, he studied two more years at G&ouml;ttingen, where he published a "Geschichte der englischen Civilliste". He then went to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, residing chiefly at Florence and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and worked there industriously in the examination of original sources. Returning to <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> he accepted the editorship of the official "M&uuml;nchener Zeitung" in order to earn a subsistence, but while thus engaged he had by 1838 qualified himself as <em>Privatdozent</em> in history at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The following year he became extraordinary, in 1841 ordinary, professor of history; in 1842 he became a member of the Academy of Sciences. In 1839 he published "Die deutschen P&auml;pste" in two volumes. After this he devoted himself to his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as professor until 1846, when he fell into disfavour with King Ludwig I on account of the position he took, along with several other professors, in the popular agitation against the relations of the king with the dancer Lola Montez. He expressed his views on the subject in "Concordat und Constitutionseid der Katholiken in Bayern", and for this was removed from his <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> position, 26 March 1847. Although the king after some months took H&ouml;fler again into the government service, he was, nevertheless, transferred to Bamberg (Upper Franconia), as keeper of the district archives. With his accustomed <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he began the study of Franconian history and published in 1849-52 as the fruit of his investigations: "Quellensammlung f&uuml;r fr&auml;nkische Geschichte", in four volumes, and in 1852-53 "Fr&auml;nkische Studien", parts I-V. During the same period he issued "Bayern, sein Recht und seine Geschichte" (1850), also in the last mentioned year "Ueber die politische Reformbewegung in Deutschland im Mittelalter und den Anteil Bayerns an derselben (1850). Further, in the midst of these labours, he began the preparation of his "Lehrbuch der Geschichte" which appeared in 1856.

<p>In 1851 when the Austrian school-system was reorganized, Count Thun called H&ouml;fler as professor of history to <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, where he taught with great success until he retired on a pension in 1882. In 1865 he became a member of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> Diet, in 1872 a life member of the Austrian House of Lords. In this latter year he was raised to the hereditary nobility and received the order of the Iron Crown. In politics he was one of the leaders of the German-Bohemian party, a branch of the constitutional party of that period, and was one of the chief opponents of the Czechs. From 1872, however, he almost practically retired from politics, partly from the increasing opposition which grew up in the German parties in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> against "Catholicism", partly because the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> party was drawing closer to the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>. Conflicts were unavoidable; on the one hand he was a thorough German, absolutely convinced of the great mission of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, on the other he was one of the most faithful sons of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Consequently he gradually withdrew from party politics, without losing, however, his strong interest in the struggles of the mostly anticlerical German-Bohemiaus against the Czechs, and devoted himself entirely to the cultivation of German sentiment and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life. By his activity, both as teacher and author, he became the founder of the modern <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of German-Bohemian historical research, which received enthusiastic support from the Society founded by him, in 1862, for the study of the history of the German element in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, and in consequence ranks as one of the most deservedly respected historians of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>.

<p>H&ouml;fler gave special attention to the history of the Hussite movement and reached the conclusion that it was directed less against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> than against the German power in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and against the cities. He characterized the movement as "an unsympathetic historical phenomenon, a movement foredoomed to failure, which soon became a burden to itself". He saw in <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Hus</a> only an antagonist of Germanism, the destroyer of the <a href="../cathen/12342a.htm">University of Prague</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. His works on Hussitism are: "Geschichtsschreiber der husitischen Bewegung" (1856-66), in three volumes; "Magister Johannes Hus und der Abzug der deutschen Professoren und Studenten aus Prag 1409" (1864); "Concilia Pragensia, 1353-1413" (1862). These historical investigations involved H&ouml;fler in a violent literary feud with Franti&scaron;ek Palack&yacute;, the official historiographer of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, an enthusiastic representative of Czech interests, and the indefatigable champion of <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> supremacy in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. But as the scientific <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> produced by H&ouml;fler were indisputable he was victorious in this controversy and broke down Palack&yacute;'s hitherto unquestioned authority as a historian. These exhaustive studies in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> history led H&ouml;fler to deeper research into the history of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> races. In his "Abhandlungen aus dem Gebiete der slawischen Geschichte" (1879-82), five volumes, he showed how the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> element had always warred against the German element; in the same work he emphasized strongly the importance of the German element in the development of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>.

<p>In other works H&ouml;fler treated the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform movements among the Romanic peoples. The most important of this class of his writings is: "Die romanische Welt und ihr Verh&auml;ltnis zu den Reformideen des Mittelalters" (1878). Others are: "Der Aufstand der kastillianischen St&auml;dte gegen Karl V" (1876); "Zur Kritik und Quellenkunde der ersten Regierungsjahre Kaiser Karls V" (1876-83), in three parts; "Der deutsche Kaiser und der letzte deutsche Papst, Karl V und Adrian VI" (1876); "Papst Adrian VI" (1880) in which he proves that this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was the author of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reform in the sixteenth century. We are also indebted to him for the two volumes of "Monumenta Hispanica" (1881-82). H&ouml;fler's contributions to the history of the Hohenzollern <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> are to be found in: "Denkw&uuml;rdigkeiten des Ritters Ludwig von Eyb" (1849), and in the monograph "Barbara, Markgr&auml;fin von Brandenburg" (1867). Other works worthy of notice are: two volumes of "Abhandlungen zur Geschichte Oesterreichs" (1871-72); "Kritische Untersuchungen &uuml;ber die Quellen der Geschichte K&ouml;nig Phiipps des Sch&ouml;nen" (1883); "Bonifatius, der Apostel der Deutschen und die Slawenapostel Konstantinos (Cyrillus) und Methodius" (1887). He also published many papers in the "Denkschriften der k.k. Akademie der Wissenschaften", in the "Fontes rerum Austriacarum", and in the "Zeitschrift des Vereins f&uuml;r die Gesch. der Deutschen in B&ouml;hmen".

<p>H&ouml;fler also wrote a number of historical dramas in verse, as well as elegant and thoughtful epigrams; his poetical works, however, met with but moderate success. H&ouml;fler was an eminent man. Endowed with a keen mind, and profound observation, as well as with many physical advantages, strong health and manly beauty, he succeeded, by hard work and "indefatigable self-discipline" says his successor Bachmann, "in surmounting many initial difficulties and later obstacles and in reaching the high position of a generally respected savant and teacher: he attained the broad views and experience of a statesman, and the sure and harmonious bearing of a sage. Himself the embodiment of kindliness and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, to such a degree that he strove to lend assistance where assistance was neither possible nor timely, he anxiously sought to respect the individuality of others and to be a model of courtesy and fairness, not merely to appear such".
