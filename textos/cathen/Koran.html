<h1>Koran</h1>  

<p>The sacred book of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Muslims</a>, by whom it is regarded as the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation of God</a>. Supplemented by the so-called <em>Hadith</em>, or traditions, it is the foundation of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> and the final authority in <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>, worship, <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethics</a>, and in social, <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> conduct.

<p>The name <em>Koran</em>, or better <em>Qur'an</em>, from the Arabic stem <em>Qara'a</em>, "to read", "to recite", means the "Reading", the "Recitation", i.e. the "Book", <em>par excellence</em>. It is also called &#151; to select a few of many titles &#151; "Alkitab" (The Book), "Furquan" ("liberation", "deliverance", of the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>), "Kitab-ul-lah" (Book of God), "Al-tanzil" (The Revelation). It consists of one hundred and fourteen <em>suras</em> or chapters, some being almost as long as the <a href="../bible/gen000.htm">Book of Genesis</a>, others consisting of but two or three sentences. It is smaller than the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, and in its present form has no chronological order or <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> sequence.
<h2>Contents and analysis</h2>

<p>The Koran contains <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, legends, history, fiction, religion and <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, social and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, threats, <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a>, fanciful descriptions of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">judgment day</a>, <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, etc. &#151; a combination of fact and fancy often devoid of force and originality. The most creditable portions are those in which <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> influences are clearly discernible. The following <a href="../cathen/01450a.htm">analysis</a> is based on Sir William Muir's chronological arrangement (op. cit. <em>infra</em>).
<h3>First period</h3>

<p>Suras 103, 91, 106, 101, 95, 102,104, 82, 92, 105 &mdash; rhapsodies, which may have been composed before <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a Divine mission, or of a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> direct from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.
<h3>Second period (the opening of Mohammed's ministry)</h3>

<p>Sura 96, the command to "recite in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>"; sura 113, on the unity and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">Deity</a>; sura 74, the command to preach, the denunciation of one of the chiefs of <a href="../cathen/10099a.htm">Mecca</a> who scoffed at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, unbelievers threatened with <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>; sura 111, Abu Lahab (the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Prophet's</a> uncle) and his wife are <a href="../cathen/04573d.htm">cursed</a>.
<h3>Third period (from the beginning of Mohammed's public ministry to the Abyssinian emigration)</h3>

<p>Suras 87, 97, 88, 80, 81, 84, 86, 90, 85, 83, 78, 77, 76, 75, 70, 109, 107, 55, 56, descriptions of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, with references to the growing opposition of the Koreish tribe.
<h3>Fourth period (from the sixth to the tenth year of Mohammed's ministry)</h3>

<p>Suras 67, 53, 32, 39, 73, 79, 54, 34, 31, 69, 68, 41, 71, 52, 50, 45, 44, 37, 30, 26, 15, 51, narratives from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Jewish Scriptures</a> and from <a href="../cathen/12617b.htm">rabbinical</a> and <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> legends; the temporary compromise with <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is connected with sura 53.
<h3>Fifth period (from the tenth year of Mohammed's ministry to the Flight from Mecca)</h3>

<p>Suras 46, 72, 35, 36, 19, 18, 27, 42, 40, 38, 25, 20, 43, 12, 11, 10, 14, 6, 64, 28, 22, 21, 17, 16, 13, 29, 7, 113, 114. The suras of this period contain some narratives from the Gospel, enjoin the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, refute the cavillings of the Koreish, and contain vivid descriptions of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, judgment, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, with <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> unity, power, and <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. Gradually the suras become longer, some of them filling many pages. In the later suras of the fifth period Medina passages are often interpolated.
<h3>Last period (suras revealed at Medina)</h3>

<p>This period includes the following suras: <ul>
<li>Sura 98: on <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.
<li>Sura 2, the longest in the Koran, is called the "Sura of the Cow" from the red heifer described in verse 67 as having been <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> at the direction of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. It is a collection of passages on various subjects, delivered during the first two or three years after the Flight. The greater portion relates to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who are sometimes exhorted and sometimes reprobated. <a href="../bible/index.html">Biblical</a> and <a href="../cathen/12617b.htm">rabbinical</a> stories abound. This sura contains the order to change the Qibla (or direction at <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>) a denunciation of the disaffected citizens of Medina, injunctions to fight, permission to bear arms in the sacred months and much matter of a legislative character promulgated on first reaching Medina, with passages of a later <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> interpolated.
<li>Sura 3 belongs partly to the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> immediately after the Battle of Bedr. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are referred to in terms of hostility. The interview with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> deputation from Najran (verses 57-63) is of a later <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. Passages pertaining to the farewell <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> are introduced with other (probably) earlier texts on the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>.
<li>Sura 8 contains instructions on the division of spoil at Bedr. Some parts are in the old Meccan style and the Koreish are frequently referred to. In sura 47 <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and slaughter are enjoined, and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolaters</a> of <a href="../cathen/10099a.htm">Mecca</a> threatened. In sura 62 the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are denounced for their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; the Friday service is to take precedence of secular engagements. In sura 5 the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are reviled; the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrines of the Christians</a> are controverted; it contains also civil ordinances and miscellaneous instructions.
<li>Sura 59, on the siege and expulsion of the Banu Nadhir.
<li>Sura 4 entitled "women", from the large portion devoted to the treatment of wives and relation of sexes. There are also ordinances on the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of inheritance and general <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>, social and political. <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">Idolatrous</a> Meccans are to be shunned, and there are animadversions against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The "disaffected" are blamed for taking the part of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.
<li>Sura 65: on <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> and kindred subjects, with some religious observations.
<li>Sura 63: menances against 'Abdallah ibn Obey for his treasonable language on the expedition against the Banu Mustaliq.
<li>Sura 24: vindication of 'Ayisha, with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of evidence for <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">conjugal unfaithfulness</a>, and miscellaneous <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>.
<li>Sura 33, composed of portions covering the year A.H. 5. The marriage of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Prophet</a> with Zeinab, wife of his adopted son, is sanctioned. There are various passages on the conjugal relations of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>, the siege of Medina, and the fall of the Banu Qoreitza.
<li>Sura 57: injunctions to fight and contribute towards the expenses of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The disaffected are warned. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are mentioned in kindly terms.
<li>Sura 61: on <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; speedy victory is promised. &#151; The remaining suras belong exclusively to the last five years of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Prophet's</a> life.
<li>Sura 48 refers to the truce of Hodeibia, and the prospect of victory and spoil to be obtained elsewhere.
<li>Sura 60: on the treatment of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who, after the truce, came over from <a href="../cathen/10099a.htm">Mecca</a>; <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolaters</a> of <a href="../cathen/10099a.htm">Mecca</a> to be shunned.
<li>Sura 66: on the affair of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> and the Coptic maid.
<li>Sura 49: blaming the profession of the Bedouin <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> as insincere, chiding the deputation which called out rudely at <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> door, and exhorting believers against distrust and uncharitableness among themselves.
<li>Sura 9 treats of the campaign to Tebuk (A. H. 9). It opens with the "release" <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of the same year and declares the antagonism of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> to all other <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>. All but <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Muslims</a> are excluded from <a href="../cathen/10099a.htm">Mecca</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>. <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">Idolaters</a> are threatened with slaughter and <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slavery</a>. <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">War</a> is declared against <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> until they are humbled and pay tribute. This sura is called "the crusade chapter", and in the early campaigns was often read on the field before battle. </ul>
<h2>Doctrine</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Koran will be fully discussed in the article on the religion of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. It is sufficient to note here that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> may be classified under four categories: <ul><li><a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or what to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; <li>practice or worship; <li>ethics, or what to do and what to avoid; <li>moral, historical, and legendary lessons taken from the canonical, but mostly <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Jewish Scriptures</a>, and from contemporary and ancient <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a>.</ul>


<h2>Chronological order and distinctive features of the suras</h2>

<p>Various efforts have been made by <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Muslim</a> writers and <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> scholars to arrange the suras chronologically, but Noldeke's arrangement is generally considered the most plausible. He divides the suras into Meccan and Medinian, namely those delivered at <a href="../cathen/10099a.htm">Mecca</a> before the Flight or Hegira, and those delivered at Medina after the Flight. The Meccan suras are divided into three periods. To the first (from the first to the fifth year of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> mission) belong the following suras &mdash; 96, 74, 111,106, 108, 104, 107, 102, 105, 92, 90, 94, 93, 97, 86, 91, 80, 68, 87, 95, 103, 85, '73, 101, 99, 82, 81, 53, 84,100, 79, 77, 78, 88, 89, 75, 83, 69, 51, 52, 56, 55, 112, 109, ll3, 114, and 1. To the second period (the fifth and sixth year of his mission) are assigned suras 54, 37, 71, 76, 44, 50, 20, 26, 15, 19, 38, 36, 43, 72, 67, 23, 21, 25, 17, 27, and 18. To the third period (from the seventh year to the Flight) belong the following suras: 32, 41 45, 16, 30, 11, 14,12, 40, 28, 39, 29, 31, 42, 10, 34, 35, 7, 46, 6, and 13. The Medina suras are those which remain, in the following order: 2, 98, 64, 62, 8, 47, 3, 61, 57, 4, 65, 59, 33, 63, 24, 58, 22, 48, 66, 60,110, 9, and 5.

<p>The characteristic features of the various suras and of the periods in which they were delivered is described by Mr. Palmer as follows:

<blockquote><p>In the Meccan Suras <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> one and steady purpose is to bring his hearers to a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the one only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; this he does by powerful rhetorical displays rather than <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> arguments, by appealing to their feelings rather than their <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>; by setting forth the manifestation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His works; by calling <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to witness to His presence; and by proclaiming His vengeance against those who associate other gods with Him, or attribute <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">offsprings</a> to Him. The appeal was strengthened by glowing pictures of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in store for those who should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and by frightful descriptions of the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting torments</a> prepared for the unbelievers. In the earlier chapters, too, the prophetic inspiration, the earnest conviction of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of his mission, and the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> emotion which his sense of responsibility <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him are plainly shown. The style is curt, grand, and often almost sublime; the expressions are full of poetical feeling, and the thoughts are earnest and passionate, though sometimes dim and confused, indicating the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> excitement and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> through which they struggled to light.

<p>In the second period of the Meccan Suras, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> appears to have conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of still further severing himself from the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> of his compatriots, and of giving to the supreme <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deity</a> <a href="../cathen/01316a.htm">Allah</a> another title, Ar-Rahman, "the merciful one". The Meccans, however, seem to have taken these for the names of separate <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a>, and the name is abandoned in the later chapters.

<p>In the Suras of the second Meccan period we first find the long stories of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of olden times, especial stress being laid upon the punishment which fell upon their contemporaries for disbelief, the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> is always the same, namely, that <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> came under precisely similar circumstances, and that a denial of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of his mission would bring on his fellow-citizens the self-same retribution. They also show the transition stage between the intense and poetical enthusiasm of the early Meccan chapters and the calm teaching of the later Medinah ones. This change is gradual, and even in the later and most prosaic we find occasionally passages in which the old prophetic fire flashes out once more. The three periods are again marked by the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> which occur throughout the Koran. In the first period they are all frequent and often long, the whole powers of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> being invoked to bear witness to the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the mission of His Apostle; in the second period they are shorter and of rarer occurrence; in the last period they are absent altogether.

<p>To understand the Medinah Suras we must bear in mind <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> position with respect to the various parties in that city. In <a href="../cathen/10099a.htm">Mecca</a> he had been a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> with little <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in his own country, looked on by some as a <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madman</a>, and by others as an <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a>, both equally grievous to him, while his following consisted of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poorest</a> and meanest of his fellow townsmen. His own clansmen, for the reason that they were his clansmen and for no other, resented the affronts against him. In Medinah he appears as a military leader and a prince, though as yet possessing far from absolute authority. Around in the city were, first, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> believers who had fled with him El Muhagerin; next, the inhabitants of Yathrib, who had joined him and who were called El Ansar, "the helpers"; and lastly, a large class who are spoken of by the uncomplimentary name of Munafiqun or <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">"hypocrites"</a>, consisting of those who went over to his side from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> or compulsion, and lastly those "in whose heart is sickness", who, though <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in him, were prevented by tribal or <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> ties from going over to him openly.

<h2>Sources</h2>

<p>The sources of the Koran be reduced to six: <ul><li>The <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> (canonical and <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>) and the hybrid <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> of the late <a href="../cathen/12617b.htm">rabbinical</a> schools. During <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were numerous in many parts of <a href="../cathen/01674a.htm">Arabia</a>, especially around Medina. Familiarity with them is undoubtly responsible for many <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> stories alluded to in Koran. Later <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> and <a href="../cathen/12617b.htm">Rabbinism</a> are equally well represented (Geiger, "Was hat Mohammed aus dem Judenthum aufgenommen?", Wiesbaden, 1833; tr. "Judaism and Islam", Madras, 1898). <li>The <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> (canonical and <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>) and various <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> doctrines. On his journeys between <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Hijaz, and Yemen, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> had every opportunity to come in close touch with Yemenite, <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a>, Ghassanite, and <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Syrian Christians</a>, especially <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. Hence, while the influence of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> upon the Koran has been slight, <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> legends, on the other hand, are one of the original sources of Koranic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. (See Muir, op. cit. infra, 66-239; Tisdall, "The Original Sources of the Qur'an", London, 1905, 55-211.) <li>Sabaism, a combination of <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manicheism</a>, and old disfigured <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a>. <li>Zoroastrianism. On account of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia's</a> political influence in the north-eastern part of <a href="../cathen/01674a.htm">Arabia</a>, it is natural to find <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrian</a> elements in the Koran. <li>Hanifism, the adherents of which, called Hanifs, must have been considerable in number and influence, as it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from contemporary <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> sources that twelve of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> followers were members of this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. <li>Native ancient and contemporary <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and practices. Wellhausen has collected in his "Reste des arabischen Heidentums" (Berlin, 1897) all that is known of pre-Islamic <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, traditions, customs, and <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a>, many of which are either alluded to or accepted and incorporated in the Koran. From the various <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> and creeds, and Abul-Fida, the well-known historian and <a href="../cathen/06447a.htm">geographer</a> of the twelfth century, it is clear that religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and practices of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> day form one of the many sources of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. From this <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> source <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> derived the practices of <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slavery</a>, which <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a> sanctioned by adopting them.</ul>
<h2>Authorship, compilation</h2>

<p>It is generally admitted that the Koran is substantially the work of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed</a>. According to the traditionalists, it contains the pure <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> he could neither read nor write, but that immediately afterwards he could do both; others <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that even before the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> he could read and write; while others, again, deny that he could ever do so. Thus it is uncertain whether any of the suras were written down by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Prophet</a> himself or all delivered by him orally and afterwards writen down by others from <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a>.

<p>The Koran is written in Arabic, in rhymed prose, the style differing considerably in the various suras, according to the various periods of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophet's</a> life. The language is universally acknowledged to be the most perfect form of <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> speech, and soon became the standard by which other Arabic literary compositions had to be judged &mdash; grammarians, lexirographers, and rhetoricians presuming that the Koran, being the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">word of God</a>, could not be wrong or imperfect.

<p><a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> hearers began by trusting their <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memories</a> to retain the words of the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> they had received from him. Later, those who could write traced them in ancient characters on palm leaves, tanned hides, or dry bones. After the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Prophet's</a> death all these fragments were collected. Zaid ibn Thabit, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammed's</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, was charged by Abu Bekr, the caliph, to collect all that could be discovered of the sacred text in one volume. The chapters were then arranged according to their length and without regard to historical sequence. The revision made twenty years later affected details of language of the text.

<p>The best and most accessible edition of the Koran is that of Flugel, "Al-Qoran: Corani textus Arabicus" (Leipzig, 1834 and since). Maracci's famous Latin translation of the Koran, with a refutation and commentary, is still unique and useful: "Alcorani textus universus" (Padua, 1698). The standard English versions are those of Sale (London, 1734) with a still useful introductory essay; Rodwel (London, 1861), arranged in chronological order; and Palmer in "Sacred Books of the East" (Oxford, 1880).
