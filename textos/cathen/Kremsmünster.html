<h1>Kremsm&uuml;nster</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, on the little river Krems, about twenty miles south of <a href="../cathen/09273a.htm">Linz</a>, founded A.D. 777 by Tassilo II Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, who richly endowed it, as did subsequently <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and his successors. The first colony of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> came from Lower <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and Fatericus was the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. The position and reputation of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> soon became such that its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, in the absence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (Passau), exercised the episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. In the tenth certury the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was destroyed in an incursion of the Hungarians, and its possessions divided among the Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and other nobles and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; but it was restored, and recovered its <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, under the emperor Henry II, when the holy and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> Gothard became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. In the following century Kremsm&uuml;nster shared the general decadence of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, and fell into decay, which was fortunately arrested by the action of the excellent Bishop Altmann of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a>, who brought a community from Gottesau, and introduced the reformed observance of Cluny into the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. After this it became known as one of the most flourishing houses in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, "excelling all other <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>" says an anonymous chronicler, "in observance and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, also in respect to its lands, buildings, books, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, and other possessions, and in the number of its members prominent in learning and in art". The monastic <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was famous, and drew eminent scholars to study at Kremsm&uuml;nster, where several important historical works were written, including histories of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a> and of the dukes of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and the chronicles of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> itself. Schrodl (Kirchenlex., VII, 1053) gives a list of writers connected with Kremsm&uuml;nster from the eleventh to the sixteenth centuries, and of their literary labours. One of the most distinguished <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> was Ulrich Schoppenzaun (1454-1484), and it was owing to his attainments and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and those of his disciple and successor Johann Schreiner (1505-1524), that at the critical time when the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> were beginning to spread in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Kremsm&uuml;nster held firmly to the old <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and doctrines.

<p>From the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> period onwards nearly every <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> who ruled the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> proved himself <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and learned, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and patriots ready to make all needful <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for his country and his emperor. Abbot Lechner, towards the middle of the sixteenth century, constituted the hitherto private <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> into a public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and did much to preserve <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in the district, where the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> doctrines had become widely prevalent. Abbot Weiner (1558-1565) unfortunately favoured the new teaching, thus introducing into the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> dissension which nearly developed into disruption. This was, however, prevented by the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of succeeding <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>; and Abbot Wolfradt especially (1613-1639) brought the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> into so highly flourishing a condition that he was known as its third founder; while its reputation as a house of studies and learning was even increased under his successor, Placid Buchauer (1644-1669). Among the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of the eighteenth century the most prominent and distinguished was <a href="../cathen/06088a.htm">Alexander Fixlmillner</a> (1731-1759), who built the great observatory, constructed many roads on the monastic estate, and was a man of most edifying life and unbounded charity to the poor. Towards tne end of this century the drastic and innovating policy of the <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a>, especially with regard to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of his dominions, brought Kremsm&uuml;nster, like other great foundations, to the verge of supression; but it happily escaped this fate. The house suffered much during the long Napoleonic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and was slow in recovering its position. It was not until the abbacy of Thomas Mitterndorfer (1840-1860) that, with its material position reinforced, and learning and discipline again flourishing within its walls, it regained all its former prestige. One of the most illustrious <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> in recent times was Dom Celestine Ganglbauer, who celebrated in 1877 the eleven-hundredth anniversary of the foundation, became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1881 and was raised to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> in 1884 (d. 1889). The present <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> is Dom Leander Czerny, who succeeded Abbot Achleutner in 1905.

<p>The community of Kremsm&uuml;nster Abbey numbers about a hundred members. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> has the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> of twenty six <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (population over 42,000) and within the precincts are a Gymnasium, or boys <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (300 pupils), of high reputation, and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. The imposing pile of buildings, as they now stand, are mostly of the eighteenth century. The valuable <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> contains some 70,000 volumes, 1700 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and nearly 2000 incunabula. There is an interesting collection of objects of natural history in the lower part of the observatory, which is eight stories high; and a curious feature is the series of fish-tanks decorated with <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">Colonnade</a>.
