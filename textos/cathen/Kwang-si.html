<h1>Kwang-si</h1>  

<p>(Prefecture Apostolic)

<p>The mission of Kwang-si comprises the entire province of that name. As a country, it is very mountainous and extremely poor. The province has a population of about ten million <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> divided among several distinct races, the most remarkable of whom are the settlers from the Canton, the Hakkas, and the wild Yao-tse and Miao-tse. The first missionary to Kwang-si was the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Ruggieri who in 1583 endeavoured without success to establish himself at the capital, Kwei-lin. Fifty years later the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Francesco d'Escalone, arrived at Wu-chou. About the middle of the seventeenth century, Father Koffler built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> at Kwei-lin and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at Nan-ning, under the name of Constantine, a son of the Emperor Yung-li, a pretender to the Ming dynasty, who still combatted in the southern part of the empire the advancing Manchu conquerors. Father Boym laboured in company with Father Koffler. In 1692 Father Jacques Duval laboured to give further impulse to the work of his predecessors, and then came Fathers Chamaya and Lopez. At the same time the Spanish Augustinians established themselves at Kwei-lin and Wu-chu, and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at Ping-lo-fu. All were expelled in 1724 by Emperor Yung Chen and Kwang-si thenceforth remained without missionaries for a hundred and thirty years. In 1848 Kwang-si, united to the mission of Kwang-tung, was confided to the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> <a href="../cathen/14079a.htm">Society of Foreign Missions</a>. In 1854 Blessed Auguste Chapdelaine first entered the province from Kwei-chou, but was arrested and thrown into the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of Si-lin-hien ten days after his arrival. Liberated after sixteen or eighteen days of captivity, he ministered until 1856. Up until this date he had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> several hundred <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, but he was again arrested, taken to Si-lin, sentenced to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>, and executed on 29 February of the same year, with Blessed Laurence Pe-mu and Agnes Tsau-kong. In 1866, several missionaries again penetrated Kwang-si, but were unable to stay long. In 1868, Father Mihi&egrave;re was appointed superior to the mission of Kwang-si, but died in 1871. Under his direction several missionaries were able to enter the province. Among them was Father Foucard, who evangelized Shang-sze, while labouring in the disguise of a wood-cutter to avoid arousing the suspicions of the mandarins.

<p>On 6 August, 1875, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> made Kwang-si a <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefecture Apostolic</a>, and placed it under the authority of Father Jolly, previously missionary in Kwang-tung. At this same period were founded the districts of Kwei-hien and of the "hundred thousand mountains" among the wild Yao-tse. Father Jolly died in 1878 and Mgr Foucard was made <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15753c.htm">Zela</a> and <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">Prefect Apostolic</a> of Kwang-si. The Chinese authorities placed many obstacles in the way of the free spread of the Gospel. Mgr Foucard was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to proceed personally to Peking and demand <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but he obtained no satisfaction. The Franco-Chinese War of 1884 served to increase the difficulties of this mission. Fathers Lavest and Pernet were subjected to cruel treatment and several <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities were uprooted. Only the communities established among the savages and at Si-lin experienced relative tranquility. Mgr Foucard died in 1878 and was succeeded by Mgr Chouzy. Under the direction of the new prefect, other communities were established, and finally a certain measure of liberty was accorded to the missionaries. Often, however, sudden revolts seriously interfered with their labours. Two missionaries, Fathers Mazel and Bertholet, were massacred in different districts. In 1899, Mgr Chouzey died, and in the following year Mgr Lavest undertook the mission. During the Boxer troubles but three missions and a few other houses belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were pillaged. Mgr Lavest subsequently moved his residence from Kwei-hien to Nan-ning, intending to erect a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at the latter place. Two French <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> have been established, one at Nan-ning, and one at Kwei-lin, by the <a href="../cathen/09749c.htm">Little Brothers of Mary</a>. <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Nuns of St. Paul of Chartres</a> have established themselves at Nan-ning and Long-chau. During 1908 they have relieved 4300 sufferers at their dispensary in Nan-ning and 4000 at that of Long-chau.

<p>The following figures give the condition of the mission at the various periods named: In 1889, 1 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 11 missionaries, 1 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, 21 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 211 pupils, 16 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 1249 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1900, 1 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 17 missionaries, 1 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> with 16 students, 24 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 310 scholars, 32 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 110 <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> of native adults and 61 <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> of native children, 1536 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1908, 1 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 27 missionaries, 4 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> with 16 students, 34 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 379 pupils, 311 <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> of adults, and 113 <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> of native children, 4214 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.
