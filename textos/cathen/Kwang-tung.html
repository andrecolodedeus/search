<h1>Kwang-tung</h1>  

<p>(Prefecture Apostolic)

<p>This prefecture comprises the whole province of that name except the civil prefecture of Shin-hing, the three districts of Heung-shan, Yan-ping, and Yeung-tsun, which belong to the <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Diocese of Macao</a>, and the three districts of San-on, Kwei-shin, and Hoi-fung, which belong to the <a href="../cathen/07450a.htm">Vicariate Apostolic of Hong-Kong</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> was the first missionary who attempted to penetrate the province of Kwang-tung (1552), but he died in the Island of Shang-sch'wan (St. John's Island), south-west of <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a>, before he was able to preach <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> there. In 1556 Father Melchior Barreto penetrated as far as Canton, where he discussed <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> with the mandarins; other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> followed, and in 1581 Father Ruggieri secured authorization to open a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. In 1582, the real founder of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, <a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Father Matteo Ricci</a>, arrived at Canton. From Canton <a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Father Ricci</a> went to Shin-hing, then the capital of the province, and afterwards to Shin-chou, were he met for the first time the celebrated Sin, a native of Kiang-nan. He then travelled to towards Kiang-si and Nan-king, establishing on the way <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> settlements, which have persevered to the present time. Until 1658 Kwang-tung was dependent on the <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Diocese of Macao</a>. In that year it was confided to Mgr de la Motte Lambert. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Missions Etrang&egrave;res then preached there together with the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. From 1682 to 1710, Mgr de Gu&eacute;m&eacute;ner and Fathers de Cec&egrave; and Ducarpon established themselves at Canton and Shin-chou. The <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Mgr de Gu&eacute;m&eacute;ner (d. 1704) is at Shin-chou as is also that of P&egrave;re Lirot (d. 1720). When the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Emperor Yong-chin broke out in 1742 there were 30,000 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the province of Kwang-tung, but all the missionaries were then expelled.

<p>From that time until 1844, when Mgr. de Lagren&eacute;e obtained the proclamation of religious liberty, the missionaries did not enter Kwang-tung except in disguise. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a> had meanwhile regained <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the province, but the number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> tended by native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had fallen to 7000 or 8000. On 30 September, 1848, the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of the Propaganda</a> confided this mission to the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Missions Estrang&egrave;res de Paris without removing all <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a>. Father Libois, <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; at Hong-Kong, was named <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a>, and Father Guillemin was the first missionary sent to the province. The progress was slow at first: there were 115 <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> of adults in 1851, 214 in 1854. In 1853 Father Guillemin was named <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a> instead of Father Libois. A <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> broke out, and seven missionaries were arrested and thrown in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. Difficulties having arisen with Macao, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> put an end to them on 8 Aug., 1856, by nominating Father Guillemin <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04580d.htm">Cybistra</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus infidelium</a>, by giving him on 17 September, 1858, complete <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over Kwang-tung, Kwang-si, and Hainan. In 1856, Blessed Auguste Chapdelaine was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in Kwang-si with two companions, Blessed Laurence Pe-mu and Blessed Agnes Chow-kong.

<p>As the result of the Anglo-French expedition, which ended in the taking of Peking, a treaty was signed on 25 October, 1860. This was a signal for wider liberty for the missionaries. In compensation for the churches which had been destroyed and the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> which had been taken from the mission, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> obtained the site of the ancient palace of the viceroy, on which were built the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>. With the assistance of <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was also built the fine <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Canton, one of the most beautiful religious monuments of the Far East. A <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> was built at Shang-ch'wan, and this island became a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> for the people of Hong-Kong, <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a>, and Canton. Baptisms became more numerous, amounting to 740 in 1862 and to 922 in 1867. There were some troubles in 1868 and 1869. In 1875 the Province of Kwang-si was separated from the Mission of Kwang-tung, while the island of Hai-nan and the district of Heung-shan was ceded to the <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Diocese of Macao</a>. These districts were given to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Missions Estrang&eacute;res de <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, who were established at Hong-Kong. The mission then ministered to 15,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; in 1880 it had 23,730 under its care. In 1881, Mgr Guillemin, worn out with labour, left Mgr Chausse, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03314b.htm">Capsa</a>, in charge of the mission. In 1884, at the time of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of Tongking, the missionaries were ordered to discontinue the mission, and had to stay at Hong-Kong for nearly a year. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> establishments of Canton were destroyed. The districts of Shun-tak, Sha-tan, Shin-hing, Tong-kun, were laid waste, but it is worthy to remark that the districts nearest Tongking suffered the least. In some of these the missionaries were able to remain throughout the hostilities. On the restoration of peace the missionaries and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who had followed them returned to the country. No indemnity was granted either to the missionaries or the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, on the pretext that the French would not restore the vessels sunk at Fu-chau.

<p>The report of 1889 gives 1 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 43 missionaries, 7 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 150 churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> with 30 students, 135 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> or <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> with 2067 pupils, 28,852 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1894 and 1895, during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, there were some disorders. A missionary was besieged for nine days in a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> village by soldiers returning from Formosa, and the mandarin of the place had to pay several thousand dollars to induce the soldiers to raise the siege. After the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, there was a great conversion movemnet which lasted several years, especially at Kit-yueng and Tong-kun. In 1898, Father Chan&egrave;s was slain with eight <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in his district of Pok-lo. In 1900, during the Boxer uprisings, several missionaries were ordered by the viceroy, then the famous Li Hung Chang, to leave the province, but they all remained at their post. However, in September, when the troops of the allies had been in Peking a month, the chief <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> settlements of Shun-tak, Sha-tan, and Tong-kun were destroyed and the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> burned by the populace. Mgr Chausse, who was ill, could not survive these disasters, and died a few days later. However, the arrival at Canton of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> and American warships soon brought the pillagers to reason. In 1901 Mgr M&eacute;sel was named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11276a.htm">Orcisto</a> and <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">Prefect Apostolic</a> of Kwang-tung. In January, 1902, Father Julien was assassinated with his two servants at Ma-tez-han, a district of Chi-hing on the frontiers of Kiang-si. In 1905 five American <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> missionaries were massacred at Lin-chou, on the borders of Hu-nan, by an infuriated populace. Since then peace has lasted. The inhabitants of Kwang-tung seem to have a decided leaning towards the things of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and America. Numerous students go to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Mgr M&eacute;rel has founded the College of the Sacred Heart, to teach English and French to the Chinese without distinction of religion. The number of students exceeds 250.

<p>In 1908 the mission of Kwang-tung ceded to the <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Diocese of Macao</a> the civil prefecture of Shin-hing and the two districts of Yang-ping and Yeung-tsum, belonging to Shin-hing at the time of the fulmination of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, instead of which the Island of Hai-nan was given to the Prefecture Apostolic of Kwang-tung. But as Shin-hing contains more than 2500 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> while the Island of Hai-nan has only 300 or 400, it will be readily understood why the reports of the mission of Kwang-tung number less <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in 1908 than in 1907. The statistics for the two years are as follows: 1907, 65 missionaries, 20 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 66 seminarians, 455 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 210 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 2050 pupils, 2037 <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> of adults, 7000 <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> children, 60,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 1908, 73 missionaries, 24 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 70 seminarians, 484 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 250 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 3500 pupils, 2214 <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> of adults, 9586 <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> of children of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, 58,917 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to about 30,000,000 <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>.
