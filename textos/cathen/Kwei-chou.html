<h1>Kwei-chou</h1>  

<p>(Vicariate Apostolic)

<p>The mission of Kwei-chou embraces the entire province of that name. The country is very mountainous and it is principally inhabited by Chinese from other provinces and the race of aborigines known under the generic term of Miao-tze, who are subdivided into numerous tribes. The Faith was carried for the first time into Kwei-chou by a Portuguese <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> towards the end of the sixteenth century. The first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> <a href="../cathen/14079a.htm">Society of Foreign Missions</a>, Mgr Pallu, was created administrator of Kwei-chou in 1658. In 1708 <a href="../cathen/15476a.htm">Father Claude Visdelou</a> was made <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of this province by Cardinal de Tournon, but never entered upon his mission. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> finally joined the mission of Kwei-chou to that of Sze-ch'wan under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Society of Foreign missions. From 1769 onwards, Mgr Potier, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Sze-ch'wan, Yun-nan, and Kwei-chou, made a practice of sending a native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> every two years to visit the few <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities established in Kwei-chou by <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm#christian">Christian families</a> migrated thither from Sze-ch'wan. The <a href="../cathen/10609a.htm">Venerable Moye</a> visited these settlements in 1774. He was arrested, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, and eventually expelled from Kwei-chou. In 1815 Blessed Joseph Chang Ta-pong was beheaded at Tsi-i. In 1839 there were other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a>, among them that of Joachim Ho. In 1846 Kwei-chou was detached from Sze-ch'wan and made an independent Vicariate Apostolic. Father Stephen Albrand, missionary in <a href="../cathen/13765a.htm">Siam</a>, was placed in charge. He found twelve hundred of the faithful in the entire province. He established himself at the capital, Kwei-yang. In 1849 he was created <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14343a.htm">Sura</a>. On 28 January, 1858, the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, Jerome Lu Pin-mei, Laurent Wang, and Agatha Ling were decapitated at Mau-keou. In 1860 Mgr Faurie succeeded Mgr Albrand. This same year, because of the victories of the British and French, the Treaty of Peking guaranteeing religious liberty was signed.

<p>The province was, however, ravaged for several years afterwards owing to feuds between the Chinese and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>. During this period <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> pillaged, and their missionaries massacred. On 29 July, 1861, four native <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were beheaded at Tsin-gai. These were Blessed Joseph Chang, Paul Chen, J. B. Lo, and Martha Wang. In 1862 Blessed John Peter Neel, a French missionary, Martin Wu, John Chang, John Chen, and Lucy I were beheaded at Kai-chou. In 1865 Father Muller was massacred with several native <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Notwithstanding the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, it was possible in 1866 to record 408 <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> of adults, and 13,178 infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> among the natives. In 1867 the number <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> included 601 adults and 11,023 infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>; in 1868, 92 adults and 9322 infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>. Mgr Faurie died in 1872 on his return from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he had taken part in the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. He was succeeded by Mgr Lions who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Basilita in 1872. Peace reigned during several years, and the missionaries were able to greatly augment the number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities, but in 1884, during the Franco-Chinese War, the persecutions were renewed. They were particularly violent in Kwei-chou. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the capital alone escaped. Hardly had this initial <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> terminated than a second, which was still more terrible, broke out, beginning with the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> establishments at Chun-king (Sze-ch'wan). The <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Father Lin, was massacred, together with his catechist and a <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophyte</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and the missionaries were only able to obtain <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> by application to Peking. In 1884 Mgr Guichard had been made coadjutor to Mgr Lions. Upon the death of the latter in 1893, Mgr Guichard took the entire management of the mission in hand. During the following period peace was secure in the Kwei-chou mission, and the missionaries were able to augment rapidly the number of their converts. In 1900 Kwei-chou again escaped the troubles which overwhelmed many of the other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missions in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. In 1907 Mgr Seguin was made coadjutor to Mgr Guichard, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12101a.htm">Pinara</a>.

<p>In 1899 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> community numbered 2 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 29 missionaries, 6 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 66 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> with 18 students, 120 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> ministering to 2031 pupils, 18,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1900: 1 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 38 missionaries, 8 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 86 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> with 36 students, 150 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and asylums with 2844 scholars, 998 native adult and 4634 native infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, 19,128 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1908: 2 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 51 missionaries, 17 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> with 62 students, 196 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and asylums with 2388 pupils, 13 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> with 855 children, 1472 native adult and 4713 native infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, 25,728 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.
