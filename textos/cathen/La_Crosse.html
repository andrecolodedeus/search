<h1>La Crosse</h1>  

<p>(CROSSENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> erected in 1868; included that part of the <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">State of Wisconsin</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> lying north and west of the Wisconsin River. In 1900 the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/14336a.htm">Diocese of Superior</a> subdivided this territory and reduced it to the Counties of Adams, <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, Chippewa, Clark, Crawford, Dunn, Eau Claire, Grant, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, Jackson, Juneau, La Crosse, Lafayette, Marathon, Monroe, Pepin, Pierce, Richland, Sauk, Trempealeau, Vernon, and Wood; an area of 17,299 square miles. It is suffragan to Milwaukee. At the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> there were ministering to the scattered <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population twenty-two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who had to care for twenty-three churches and about fifty stations. Besides the English and German congregations provision had also been made for Poles and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>. <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> sisters and lay teachers had charge of six <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The Very Rev. Michael Heiss, then head of St. Francis's Seminary, <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, was elected as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 6 Sept., 1868. He was born at Pfaldorf, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, 12 April, 1818; in 1835 he entered the University of Munich, where M&ouml;hler, <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, and G&ouml;rres were professors, intending to study <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but changed his mind, took a course in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at the age of twenty-two. Knowing the need of German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> he arrived in New York, 17 December, 1842, and was affiliated to the <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Diocese of Louisville</a>. Two years later he moved to Milwaukee at the invitation of Bishop Henni, and in 1846 erected the first <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church in that city, his charge extending over an area of fifty- two square miles. He opened a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in a private house, which was subsequently merged into the Seminary of St. Francis, of which he was president. During the twelve years of his administration in La Crosse, he built several churches, including the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and the episcopal residence. While president of St. Francis's Seminary he published in English "The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a> Examined and Vindicated on <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Principles" and a Latin essay "De Matrimonio." As a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> he took part in the Councils of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> in 1849 and 1866, and <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> made him a member of one of the four great commissions of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> engaged in the preparatory work for the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, 1869-70. On 14 March, 1880, he was appointed coadjutor with right of succession to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, and succeeded, 7 September, 1881. He died at La Crosse, 26 March, 1890.

<p>Kilian Flasch, second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was born at Retzstadt, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, 16 July, 1837. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> took him to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> when he was ten years old, and settled near Milwaukee. He made his academic studies at Notre Dame University, and his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course at St. Francis's Seminary, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, 16 September, 1859. With two brief intermissions he spent the subsequent years as professor and <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of this <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> until he was selected as the successor of Bishop Heiss and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of La Crosse, 24 August, 1881. During his administration of ten years he laboured <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> to increase the churches and the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and died after a long illness, 3 August, 1891.

<p>James Schwebach, his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, succeeded him as the third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 25 February, 1892. He was born at Platten, <a href="../cathen/09465a.htm">Luxembourg</a>, 15 August, 1847. He made his early studies at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Diekirk, and in 1864 <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, where he completed his course at the Seminary of St. Francis, <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. 17 July, 1870. Soon after, appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Mary's Church, La Crosse, he built two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and two churches there under Bishops Heiss and Flasch. The latter appointed him <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.
