<h1>La Grande Chartreuse</h1>  

<p>The mother-house of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian Order</a> lies in a high valley of the Alps of Dauphine, at an altitude of 4268 feet, fourteen miles north of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>. <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Medieval</a> writers were awestruck by the desolation of the spot, and Martene, who visited it in 1760, writes: "One cannot conceive how it could enter into the mind of man, to establish a community in a spot so horrible and so barren as this." Modern writers praise its picturesqueness, but some, like Ruskin, find the mountains around, "the simplest commonplace of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> cliff, with no peaks, no glaciers, no cascades, nor even any slopes of pine in extent of majesty". The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> lies in an open pasture. On the east the ridge of the Grand-Som towers above its roof, on the south the road approaches through a narrow gorge, while on the north and west the valley is shut in by heights covered with woods, due to the planting of the earlier <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, but now the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the State. The first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, built by <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> in 1084 on the spot marked by the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Notre-Dame de Casalibus, was destroyed by an avalanche in 1132, and the new buildings were erected on part of the site of the present <em>grand clo&icirc;tre.</em> The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was burnt eight times between 1320 and 1676. At the latter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the prior, Innocent Le Masson, began to rebuild the greater part of it in the somewhat cold and heavy style of the period. His work was solid, and there is a severe monastic element about it. The buildings of today are substantially as he left them, though they have been extensively restored during the nineteenth century. They are on the typically <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> plan, with the addition of the great guest-houses and capitular hall, constructed to accommodate the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> attending the general chapters, together with their attendants. The most ancient portions are the Gothic parts of the <em>grand clo&icirc;tre</em> (over 700 feet long) and the church, which dates in part from 1320 or perhaps earlier, but owes its present form to restoration in the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, with a small portion of the surrounding pastures, was rented from the State till, in accordance with the Association Laws of 1901, the last <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were expelled by two squadrons of dragoons on the 19th of April, 1903. For the history of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and order and for the famous liqueur see <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">CARTHUSIAN ORDER</a>.

<p>[<em>Note:</em> The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of La Grand Chartreuse, driven into exile with the prior general, found refuge at Farneta, in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, until 1929, when Montrieux, the first of the French charterhouses to be restored, was reopened. Only in 1940, in the unsettled conditions of World War II, were the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> able to re-occupy La Grande Chartreuse.]
