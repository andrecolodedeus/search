<p>DIOCESE OF LA PAZ (PACENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of La Paz, in <a href="../cathen/02627a.htm">Bolivia</a>. The city is the capital of the department of the same name, is the most populous city of the <a href="../cathen/02627a.htm">Republic of Bolivia</a>, and since 1899 its capital. It is about thirty miles south-east of Lake Titicaca, is connected by railway with the <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peruvian</a> harbour town of <a href="../cathen/12569a.htm">Puno</a>, situated on the lake, and is 12,200 feet above sea-level. The city is regularly laid out, but built on very steep ground, and according to the last census (1900) has a population of 54,713, chiefly mestizos (called cholos) and <a href="../cathen/02164e.htm">Aymar&aacute; Indians</a>. The most prominent buildings are a new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> built in the eighties of white marble with Corinthian columns, situated on the steep plaza, and the monastic churches of <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>, <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, and San Juan de Dios. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> attached to these churches, although secularized immediately after the establishment of the republic, were later restored to their respective orders. The most important <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of men are <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, La Merced, and La Recoleta; there are also the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception, and the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> (El Carmen), both new buildings which the city government of La Paz made an unsuccessful attempt, in 1909, to confiscate for <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> purposes, ostensibly because, unlike the other orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in the city engaged in teaching or nursing, these two devoted themselves to the contemplative life (see the protest of <a href="../cathen/01740a.htm">Bishop Armentia</a> in the "Boletin Eclesi&aacute;stico", No. 8, 1909). French Sisters of Charity conduct both the city <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and a medical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> is attached to the Loaiza Hospital for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The Academia Aymar&aacute; was founded in 1900 to foster the study of history, and publishes the "Academia Aymar&aacute;," (La Paz, 1901--). The Sociedad Geogr&aacute;fica de la Paz, founded in 1889 and reorganized in 1896, with four sections, for <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, physics, political <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and commerce respectively, publishes the "Boletin", as well as separate works. Finally, the Institution Lejion, formed in 1908 from the Federaci&oacute;n Enciclop&eacute;dica, Sociedad Enciclop&eacute;dica Filantr&oacute;pica, and the Union Filarm&oacute;nica, for the promotion of the study of natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and also of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14115a.htm">sociological</a> studies, issues the "Revista".

<p>La Paz is one of the oldest Spanish colonies on the table-land of Old <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>. In 1549 the city was founded by Captain Alonzo de Mendoza (according to others, about 1548, by Diaz de Medina) on the site of an earlier Indian settlement called Chuquiabo ("gold field", because gold was washed here). To commemorate the restoration of peace after the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> following the insurrection of Gonzalo Pizarro, the city was called Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Paz. After the victory of the patriot army under General Sucre at <a href="../cathen/02164a.htm">Ayacucho</a> (1824) it was named La Paz de Ayacucho, but the latter designation was used as seldom as the former, and the city, afterwards as before, was called simply "La Paz". One of the most remarkable events in its history was the siege endured during the Indian revolt under Tupac Amaru in 1780, heroically repulsed by the commandant of the town, Sebastiano Segurola. Later, during the South American struggles for independence, La Paz was one of the first cities to join the movement. On 16 July, 1809, citizens and soldiers rose, at first, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, only against the French party and in favour of Ferdinand VII, but with the ultimate object of freeing themselves from the mother country. This first uprising was suppressed by General Goyeneche, who was sent from <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a> against the insurgents, and had all the chiefs executed. After the battle of <a href="../cathen/02164a.htm">Ayacucho</a> La Paz was the head-quarters of General Sucre and since then, at intervals, has been the capital of the country.

<p>The Diocese of La Paz was separated from that of Charcas by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, 4 July, 1605 (see <a href="../cathen/08795a.htm">DIOCESE OF LA PAZ</a>). In the records of the Audiencia de Charcas, preserved in the "Archivo General de Indias" at Simancas, Diego de Zambrana y Guzm&aacute;n appears to have been the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, though he apparently did not take possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> vouched for by history was Domingo Balderrama, O.P., who assumed office in 1610 (d. 1615). He was succeeded in 1616 by Pedro de Valencia, who died in 1631, blind and an octogenarian. The next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, highly trained in law and literature, was Feliciano de la Vega, from 1628 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12258b.htm">Popay&aacute;n</a>, who remained for only a year (1639) at the head of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He published the first synodal constitutions and died in 1640, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Mexico. Among the subsequent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the following are prominent: Antonio de Castro y Castillo, O.F.M. (1648-53), whose detailed report on his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is preserved in the Archivo General de Indias at Simancas (printed in the "Boletin Eclesi&aacute;stico", 1908-9, No. 5 sqq.); Juan de Queipo; Llano y Vald&eacute;s (1681-95), who finished the first <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (1685) and was subsequently transferred to Charcas. The eleventh <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Agustin Rodriguez Delgado, was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11438a.htm">Panama</a> in 1725 and became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of La Paz in 1731, in which capacity, in 1738, he edited the constitutions of the Third Diocesan Synod of La Paz. In 1748 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Charcas and in 1746 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>, and died in the same year on his way to <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>. Gregorio Francisco de Campos (1764-87) completed the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and dedicated it on 23 April, 1784. The twenty-sixth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Juan de Dios Bosque (1874-90), published 29 November, 1883, the synodal constitutions still in force. The actual <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (the twenty-eighth) <a href="../cathen/01740a.htm">Mgr. Nicol&agrave;s Armentia, O.F.M.</a>, has rendered distinguished services in the geographical exploration of <a href="../cathen/02627a.htm">Bolivia</a>. He was born 5 December, 1845, at Bernedo in the Spanish province of Alava, received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in Biscaglia and in 1860 entered the French <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> province of St-Louis. In 1865 he was sent to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> college at La Paz, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1869, after which he laboured from 1871 till 1880 as a missionary among the Indians in Tumupasa and Covendo. In June, 1881, he went to the Araunas and Pacaguaras on business for the Government. With a knapsack on his back containing clothes, provisions, and a sextant, a breviary in one hand and a compass in the other, he traversed the broad territory between the Beni and Madre de Dios Rivers. He followed the Beni for its entire length and examined the surrounding forests, remaining until 1883. After his return to La Paz he published, in 1884, the result of his explorations under the title "Diario de sus viajes &aacute; las tribus comprendidas entre el Beni y Madre de Dios y en el arroyo de Iv&oacute;n en los dos a&ntilde;os de 1882 y 1883". In May, 1884, <a href="../cathen/01740a.htm">Armentia</a> navigated the Madre de Dios, pushing as far as 10&#176; S. lat., exploring the Ort&oacute;n River (Tahuamanu), among others, and returning to La Paz in August, 1886. Here, in 1887, he published his second work: "Navegaci&oacute;n del Madre de Dios" (in "Biblioteca Boliviana de geografia &eacute; historia", I), translated into Italian by <a href="../cathen/09639c.htm">Marcellino da Civezza</a> in his "Storia universale delle missioni Francescane" (VII, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1894, part IV, 503-663). In this <a href="../cathen/01740a.htm">Armentia</a> describes, besides the fauna and flora of the countries he traversed, the customs and tongues of the tribes he visited, especially the Araunas, and laid before the Government a plan showing how the work of civilization begun by him among these savages could be most effectively carried on. On 22 October, 1901, <a href="../cathen/01740a.htm">Armentia</a> was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of La Paz, and 24 February, 1902, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at Sucre. He published the "Regla Consueta" of his order in 184 articles (8 Dec., 1903), and wrote a valuable history of the old <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missions in <a href="../cathen/02627a.htm">Bolivia</a> under the title "Relaci&oacute;n hist&oacute;rica de las misiones Franciscanas de Apolobamba, por otro nombre Frontera de Caupolic&aacute;n" (La Paz, 1903).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> includes the entire Department of La Paz and the Province of Magdalena in the Department of Beni. It numbers 700,000 inhabitants in 72 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, served by about one hundred <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. The religious congregations represented in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, with the missionary college of San Jos&eacute;, opened at La Paz in 1837; the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Recollects with various mission <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> with a flourishing college (150 day scholars and 50 interns); the <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Mercedarians</a> with free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> with a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>; Dom Bosco's <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians</a> with an institute opened in 1887 (a business and trade <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>). The <a href="../cathen/03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a>, the Sisters of the Most Sacred Heart (Picpus Sisters), the Sisters of the Good Shepherd, and the Daughters of St. Anne devote themselves to teaching and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>, while the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception and the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> follow the contemplative life. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter has ten canons.
