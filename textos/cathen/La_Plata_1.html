<p>ARCHDIOCESE OF LA PLATA/DE PLATA (OR CHARCAS)

<p>La Plata, besides being the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/02627a.htm">Bolivia</a>, is one of the three principal cities of that republic. The other two are La Paz and <a href="../cathen/04075b.htm">Cochabamba</a>. The city owes its origin to the famous silver mines of Potosi, which are nearby. Owing to the chill climate of Potosi, which is about 13,000 feet above the level of the sea, the wealthy mine-owners conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of seeking a more pleasant habitation for their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, in a milder temperature, about sixty miles to the north-east. The city is said to have been founded as early as 1536, under the name of Villa de la Plata (Silver City); it was also long called, from the district in which ft is situated, Charcas, or popularly, Chuquisaca (Golden Gate). After the victory of General Sucre near Ayacucho (1824), it was named in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, Sucre. La Plata is built on a plateau, 8837 feet above the level of the sea, on the Cochimayo, a tributary of the Pilcomayo, flowing into it from the left, and is the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the department of Chuquisaca, numbering 20,907 inhabitants (1900), chiefly Indians and Mestizos. The city is the residence of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, has a medical institute founded in 1905, with a meteorological observatory, a museum of <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a> and natural history, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missionary college, built in 1837 by Father Herrero, O.F.M., a flourishing college of arts and industries of the <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians</a> of Don Bosco (connected with the Oratory), an <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratory of St. Philip Neri</a>, also a geographical <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, whose principal work has been the "Diccionario geografico del departamentode Chuquisaca" (Sucre, 1903). The many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> of the city are for the most part unattractive, the exteriors covered with unsightly stucco work, the interiors with wretched <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>. The only one worthy of note is the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Nuestra Senyora de Guadalupe, a building with three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> and an imposing tower. This <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is remarkable for its wealth of treasures in silver, which, however, have recently diminished in importance, a part having been melted down by President Melgarejo. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> image of Our Lady of Guadalupe, about seven feet in height, and encrusted with diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and pearls, is still in the church, and is valued at about two million dollars. Of the twenty-four massive silver candelabra, there are two at present weighing each about 110 pounds. Also in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> are a large number of valuable <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, among others a "Madonna de la Paz" by <a href="../cathen/10644a.htm">Murillo</a>, a "Martyrdom of St. Bartholomew" by <a href="../cathen/13031b.htm">Ribera</a>, a "Crucifixion of St. Andrew" by Montufar. In the adjoining <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of <a href="../cathen/13447a.htm">San Juan</a> de Mata are two artistic <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of St. Clement and St. Aquila, both containing <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. The spacious sala capitular, or chapter hall, contains the portraits of all the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08798a.htm">Diocese of La Plata</a>, or Charcas, was erected by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a>, 27 June, 1552, as a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>. On 4 July, 1605, <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> founded two new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> out of <a href="../cathen/08798a.htm">La Plata</a> territory, <a href="../cathen/08795a.htm">La Paz</a> and Santa Cruz de la Sierra, and on 20 July, 1609, raised La Plata to <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank. The province formerly embraced, in addition to the two above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, practically all the territory now comprised in <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>, <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentina</a>, <a href="../cathen/11438a.htm">Panama</a>, <a href="../cathen/11470b.htm">Paraguay</a>, etc. Today the boundaries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Province of <a href="../cathen/08798a.htm">La Plata</a> coincide with those of the Republic of <a href="../cathen/02627a.htm">Bolivia</a>, embracing only the suffragan Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/08795a.htm">La Paz</a>, <a href="../cathen/13456b.htm">Santa Cruz de la Sierra</a>, and Cochabamba, erected in 1847. The list of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08798a.htm">La Plata</a> comprises six names; that of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, thirty-six, including the present incumbent of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Prominent among them are: Alonso de Peralta (1609-16), who died in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>; Fernando de Arias y Ugarte (1627-30), previously <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13457a.htm">Santa Fe</a> de Bogota, held the first provincial synod in 1629, was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> father to the Indians, and died, in 1638, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>; Gaspar de Villaroel, O.S.A. (1659-67), formerly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Santiago de Chile and Arequipa, also known as a writer on canon law and <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetics</a> (<a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a>, "Nomenclator literarius," 2nd ed., Innsbruck, II, 1893, 138); Cristoval de Castilla y Zamora (1655-82), natural son of <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a>, who built the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and the former <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace (now the president's mansion); Bartolome Gonzalez y Poveda (1683-92), who expended a hundred thousand pesos on the erection of the side <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a> and the tower of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; Pedro Miguel de Argandonya (1761-76), formerly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a> de Tucuman, who built the charter hall and held the second provincial synod in 1776, during the course of which his death occurred; the Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Jos&eacute; Antonio de San Alberto (1785-1804), a veritable father of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, who founded the local <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratory of St. Philip Neri</a> and was also a writer of some merit on ascetical subjects; the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Benito Maria de Moxo y Francoli (1807-16), a well-trained scholar, the author of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> and also of some polished poems in Latin and Italian, who died at <a href="../cathen/13404a.htm">Salta</a>, in <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentina</a>, having been banished thither by General Rondeau; Pedro Puch y Solona (1862-85); who assisted at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. The present (thirty-sixth) <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Sebastiano Francisco Pifferi, born, 4 November, 1848, at Castelmadama in the <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Diocese of Tivoli</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.
