<h1>La Rochelle</h1>  

<p>The Diocese of La Rochelle (Rupellensis), suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, comprises the entire Department of Charente-Inf&eacute;rieure. The See of Maillezais (see <a href="../cathen/09413a.htm">L<font size=-2>U&Ccedil;ON</font></a>) was transferred on 7 May, 1648, to La Rochelle, which diocese just, previous to the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, aside from the territory of the former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maillezais, included the present arrondissements of Marennes, Rochefort, La Rochelle, and a part of Saint-Jean d'Ang&eacute;ly. At the Concordat the entire territory of the former See of Saintes (less the part comprised in the Department of Charente, and belonging to the <a href="../cathen/01513b.htm">See of Angoul&ecirc;me</a>) and of the See of <a href="../cathen/09413a.htm">Lu&ccedil;on</a> was added to it. In 1821 a see was established at <a href="../cathen/09413a.htm">Lu&ccedil;on</a>, and had under its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, aside from the former Diocese of Lu&ccedil;on, almost the entire former Diocese of Maillezais; so that Maillezais, once transferred to La Rochelle, no longer belongs to the diocese now known as La Rochelle et Saintes.
<h2 id="section1">See of La Rochelle</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/08784b.htm">Mgr Landriot</a>, a well-known religious writer, occupied this see from 1856 to 1867. St. Louis of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> is the titular saint of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of La Rochelle and the patron of the city. St. Eutropius, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Saintes, is the principal patron of the present Diocese of La Rochelle. In this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are especially <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a>: St. Gemme, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (century unknown); St. Seronius, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (third century); St. Martin, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the Saintes <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (fifth century); St. Vaise, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> about 500; St. Maclovius (Malo), first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Aleth, Brittany, who died in Saintonge about 570; St. Amand, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maastricht (seventh century). From 1534 La Rochelle and the Province of Aunis were a centre of <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>. In 1573 the city successfully resisted the Duke of Anjou, brother of Charles IX, and remained the chief fortress of the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. But in 1627 the alliance of La Rochelle with the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to Louis XIII and to <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> that the political independence of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> would be a menace to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; the famous siege of La Rochelle (5 August, 1627-28 October, 1628), in the course of which the population was reduced from 18,000 inhabitants to 5000, terminated with a capitulation which put an end to the political claims of the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> minority.
<h2 id="section2">Ancient See of Saintes</h2>

<p>Saintes had a certain importance under the Romans, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by many existing monuments. The oldest <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of known date is Peter, who took part in the Council of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> (511). The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, however, is St. Eutropius. <a href="../cathen/06149a.htm">Venantius Fortunatus</a>, in a poem written in the second half of the sixth century, makes explicit mention of him in connexion with Saintes. Eutropius was said to be a <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a> of royal descent, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> and sent to Gaul by St. Clement; at Saintes he <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> the governor's daughter, St. Eustelle, and like her suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. This tradition is noted by <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a>, with a cautious <em>ut fertur</em>; Saintes is thus the only church of Gaul which <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory</a> traces back to the first century. This evidence is much weakened, says Mgr Duchesne, by <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory's</a> remark to the effect that no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the history of St. Eutropius before the removal of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> by Bishop <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a>, which took place about 590. At this tardy date seems to have arisen the account of Eutropius as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Saintes are mentioned: St. Vivianus (119-52?), once Count of Saintes, later a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>; St. Trojanus, died about 532; St. Concordius (middle of the sixth century); S. Pallais (Palladius), about 580, to whom <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> recommended St. Augustine on way to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; <a href="../cathen/09179b.htm">St. Leontius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 625; Cardinal Raimond Perauld (1503-05), an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer, several times <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> for a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the infidels and the re-establishment of peace between Maximilian and Louis XII; Cardinal Fran&ccedil;ois Soderini (1507-16), who died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as dean of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, and his nephew Jules Soderini (1516-44); Charles of Bourbon (1544-50), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1548, afterward <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, whom Mayenne wished later to make King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; Pierre Louis de La Rochefoucauld (1782-92), massacred at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> with his brother, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>, 2 September, 1792, thus closing the list of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> as it opened, with a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>.

<p>Several councils were held at Saintes: in 562 or 563, when Bishop Emerius, illegally elected, was deposed and Heraclius appointed in his stead; other councils were held in 579, 1074 or 1075, 1080, 1081, at which last, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> authority over the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of Lower Brittany was granted to Tours as against the claims of Dol, and William VII gave the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Eutropius to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Cluny; also in 1083, 1088, 1089, 1097. The <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of St. Eutropius, one of the largest in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, dates from the beginning of the twelfth century. <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> it on 20 April, 1096. Kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and dukes of Guyenne, enriched the church with numerous foundations. Charles VII made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to it in 1441. Louis XI himself wrote a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> against dropsy, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Eutropius. Through the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> many <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> were made to the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. In 1568 the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> ravaged the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Eutropius was so well hidden by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> that it was thought to be lost; it was not until 19 May, 1843, that it was again discovered. In a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, 1451, it is said that the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Saintes was the second church ever dedicated to St. Peter. Geoffrey Martel, Count of Anjou, and his wife, Agnes of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, founded in 1047 the Abbey of Notre-Dame de Saintes for <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, which foundation was sanctioned by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a>. During seven centuries this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> had thirty abbesses, most of them daughters of the first <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church, now a military barrack, is Poitou Romanesque of the twelfth century. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Saintes claims the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of being the first to begin the practice of the <a href="../cathen/01486b.htm">Angelus</a>; when <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> heard of this <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> custom he solemnly authorized it by two <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> (1318, 1327). The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of "Angeriacum", founded in 768 by Pepin the Short, was the beginning of the town of Saint-Jean-d'Ang&eacute;ly. In 1010 Abbot Alduin, while having the walls of the church restored, declared that he found in a cylindrical stone a silver <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> containing the head of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>; William V, Duke of Aquitaine, had the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> exposed, and King Robert and Queen Constance inspected it. The future fifteenth-century Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02241b.htm">Jean de La Balue</a> was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Saint-Jean-d'Ang&eacute;ly. Bernard Palissy, the famous artist in ceramics (1510-90), was one of the founders of the <a href="../cathen/12710a.htm">Protestant Reform Church</a> of Saintes, and his atelier was about 1562 a secret assembly-place of the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>; for this he was summoned before the Parliament. Aside from the Basilica of St. Eutropius, the principal <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Our Lady of Corme-Ecluse, near Saujon; Our Lady of Pity, at Croix-Gente (twelfth century); Our Lady of Seven Sorrows, at Jaugou.

<p>There were in the Diocese of La Rochelle, when the Associations Law was enforced, <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, <a href="../cathen/09749c.htm">Little Brothers of Mary</a>, Marianists, Children of Mary Immaculate, and a local congregation called the Brothers of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, known as "farming brothers"; this congregation, founded in 1841 by P&egrave;re Deshayes, then superior general of the Missionaries of the Holy Ghost, the <a href="../cathen/15668a.htm">Daughters of Wisdom</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06330b.htm">St. Gabriel Brothers</a>, looked after the agricultural instruction of foundlings. Three congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> trace their origin to this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>: the Providence <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, a teaching order founded at La Rochelle in 1658 by Isabelle Mauriet; Providence Sisters of St. Mary, a teaching order founded in 1818, with the motherhouse at Saintes; <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> of the Sacred heart, a nursing and teaching order, founded in 1807 by P&egrave;re Charles Barreaud, with motherhouse at Pons. In 1900, before the Associations Law, the religious congregations had in the diocese one cr&egrave;che, 34 day nurseries, one convalescent home for children, an institute for the blind, an agricultural settlement for boys, 8 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for girls, an industrial room, a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for the preservation of young girls from danger, 14 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, homes, and asylums for the aged, 18 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of visiting nurses, 2 houses of retreat, and an insane asylum. In 1905 (last year of the Concordat) the Diocese of La Rochelle had 452,149 inhabitants, 46 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 326 succursal churches, 52 curacies.
