<h1>La Salette</h1>  

<p>Located in the commune and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of La Salette-Fallavaux, Canton of Corps, Department of Isere, and <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Diocese of Grenoble</a>. It is celebrated as the place where, it is said, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">appeared</a> to two little shepherds; and each year is visited by a large number of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>.

<p>On 19 September, 1846, about three o'clock in the afternoon in full sunlight, on a mountain about 5918 feet high and about three miles distant from the village of La Salette-Fallavaux, it is related that two children, a shepherdess of fifteen named M&eacute;lanie Calvat, called Mathieu, and a shepherd-boy of eleven named Maximin Giraud, both of them very <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, beheld in a resplendent light a "beautiful lady" clad in a strange costume. Speaking alternately in French and in patois, she charged them with a message which they were "to deliver to all her people". After complaining of the impiety of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and threatening them with dreadful chastisements in case they should persevere in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, she promised them the Divine mercy if they would amend.

<p>Finally, it is alleged, before disappearing she communicated to each of the children a special secret. The sensation caused by the recital of M&eacute;lanie and Maximin was profound, and gave rise to several investigations and reports. Mgr. Philibert de Bruillard, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, appointed a commission to examine judicially this marvellous event; the commission concluded that the reality of the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparition</a> should be admitted. Soon several <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> cures took place on the mountain of La Salette, and <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to the place were begun. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, needless to say, was ridiculed by <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">free-thinkers</a>, but it was also questioned among the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and especially by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. There arose against it in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a> and Lyons a violent opposition, aggravated by what is known as the incident of Ars. As a result of this hostility and the consequent agitation, Mgr. de Bruillard (16 November 1851) declared the <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> as certain, and authorized the cult of Our Lady of La Salette. This act subdued, but did not suppress, the opposition, whose leaders, profiting by the succession in 1852 of a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/06562a.htm">Mgr. Ginoulhiac</a>, to Mgr. Bruillard, who had resigned, retaliated with violent attacks on the reality of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of La Salette. They even asserted that the "beautiful lady" was a young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> named Lamerliere, which story gave rise to a widely advertised suit for <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a>. Despite these hostile acts, the first stone of a great church was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> laid on the mount of La Salette, 25 May, 1852, amid a large assembly of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. This Church, later elevated to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>, was served by a body of a religious called <a href="../cathen/09009a.htm">Missionaries of La Salette</a>. In 1891 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> replaced these missionaries, driven into exile by persecuting <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>.

<p>As said above, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> confided to each of the two children a special secret. These two secrets, which neither M&eacute;lanie or Maximin ever made known to each other, were sent by them in 1851 to <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> on the advice of Mgr. de Bruillard. It is unknown what impressions these mysterious revelations made on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, for on this point there were two versions diametrically opposed to each other. Maximin's secret is not known, for it was never published. M&eacute;lanie's was inserted in its entirety in brochure which she herself had printed in 1879 at <a href="../cathen/09107d.htm">Lecce, Italy</a>, with the approval of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that town. A lively controversy followed as to whether the secret published in 1879 was identical with that communicated to <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1851, or in its second form it was not merely a work of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. The latter was the opinion of wise and prudent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, who were persuaded that a distinction must be made between the two M&eacute;lanies, between the innocent and simple <em>voyante</em> of 1846 and the visionary of 1879, whose mind had been disturbed by reading apocalyptic books and the lives of <em>illuminati</em>. As <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> uttered no decision the strife was prolonged between the disputants. Most of the defenders of the text of 1879 suffered censure from their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Maximin Giraud, after an unhappy and wandering life, returned to Corps, his native village, and died there a holy death (1 March, 1875). M&eacute;lanie Calvat ended a no less wandering life at <a href="../cathen/01345b.htm">Altamura, Italy</a> (15 December, 1904).
