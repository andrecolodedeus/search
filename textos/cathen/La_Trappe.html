<h1>La Trappe</h1>  

<p>This celebrated abbey of the Order of Reformed <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> is built in a solitary valley surrounded by forests, and watered by numerous streams which form, in the vicinity, a number of beautiful lakes. The location is eighty-four miles from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and nine miles from the little town of Mortagne in the Department of Orne and the <a href="../cathen/13681d.htm">Diocese of S&eacute;ez</a>, within the ancient Province of Normandy. At its beginning it was only a small <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, built in 1122 in pursuance of a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> made by Rotrou II, Count of Perche, who, a few years afterwards, constructed a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> adjoining, to which he invited the religious of Breuil-Benoit, an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> belonging to the Order of Savigny, then in great renown for fervour and holiness; and in 1140 the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of La Trappe was erected into an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. In 1147 Savigny, with all its affiliated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, was united to the Order of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, and from this time forth La Trappe was a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, immediately depending on the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Clairvaux. During several centuries La Trappe remained in obscurity and, as it were, lost in the vast multitude of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> that claimed <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> for their mother. But in the course of the fifteenth century La Trappe, on account of its geographical situation, became a prey to the English troops during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and in the sixteenth century, it, like all the other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, had the misfortune to be given "in commendam"; after this the religious had nothing further to preserve than the mournful ruins of a glorious past.

<p>However, the hour was soon to come when the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was to have a bright return to its primitive fervour. The author of this reform was de Ranc&eacute;, fourteenth commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of La Trappe, who as regular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, employed all his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in this great enterprise, the noble traditions of the holy founders of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> being again enforced. The good odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the inhabitants of La Trappe soon made the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> celebrated amongst all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> nations. On 13 February, 1790, a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Government was directed against the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and the Abbey of La Trappe was suppressed; but the religious, who had taken the road to exile under their <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Dom Augustin de Lestrange, were one day to see the doors reopen to them. In 1815, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, which had been sold as national <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, was repurchased by Dom Augustin, but on their return the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> found nothing besides ruin; they rebuilt their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the foundations of the old one, and on 30 August, 1832, the new church was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13681d.htm">S&eacute;ez</a>. In 1880 the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> were again expelled; they, however soon returned to the great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and satisfaction of the <a href="../cathen/08719a.htm">working</a> classes and the poor. Under the able administration of the present <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Dom Etienne Salasc, the forty-fifth <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> since the foundation and the fourteenth since the reform of de Ranc&eacute;, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> has been entirely rebuilt: the new church, which is greatly admired, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 30 August, 1895. The different congregations of <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> are now united in a single order, the official name being the "Order of Reformed Cistercians", but for a long time they will continue to be known by their popular name of "Trappists" (see <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">CISTERCIANS</a>).

<p><a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> was a frequent visitor at La Trappe, in order to spend a few days in retreat with his friend the Abbot de Ranc&eacute;; James II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, when a refugee in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, went there to look for consolation. <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Dom Mabillon</a>, after his long quarrels with de Ranc&eacute; visited him there to make peace with him. The Count of Artois, afterwards Charles X, spent several days at the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>; and in 1847 Louis Philippe wished likewise to visit this celebrated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Amongst those who have contributed to the glory of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in modern times we will only mention Father Robert known to the world as Dr. Debreyne, one of the most renowned physicians of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and held in high repute for his numerous medico-theological works.
