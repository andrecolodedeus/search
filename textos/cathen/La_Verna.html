<h1>La Verna</h1>  

<p>An isolated mountain hallowed by association with <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, situated in the centre of the <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> Appenines, and rising about 4000 feet above the valley of the Casentino. Its name (Latin, Alverna) is said to come from the Italian verb <em>vernare</em>, to make cold or freeze. On 8 May, 1213, La Verna was given to St. Francis by Count Orlando of Chiusi as a retreat "specially favourable for contemplation". Thither the saint withdrew in August, 1224, to keep a forty days fast in preparation for Michelmas, and it was while <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> on the mountain-side that he received (on or about 14 Sept.) the <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">stigmata</a>. Thenceforth La Verna became sacred ground. <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Pope Alexander IV</a> took it under his protection. In 1260 a church was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> there in presence of <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> and several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. A few years later the Chapel of the Stigmata was erected, through the munificence of Count Simone of Battifole, near the spot where the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> took place. An older <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, S. Maria degli Angeli, which was built 1218 for St. Francis by Orlando, is approached from the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> of the Chiesa Maggiore, which was begun in 1348, but not finished until 1459. From the latter church the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> dwelling on La Verna go in solemn procession twice daily (at 2 P.M. and at midnight) to the Chapel of the Stigmata. On the Feast of the Stigmata (17 Sept.) and on other festivals, large crowds of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with their people from neighbouring <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, as well as strangers, visit the mountains, and on sch occasions the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> often accommodate and entertain between 2000 and 3000 <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was partly destroyed by fire in the fifteenth century; it suffered <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a> also during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of this century. In 1810, and again in 1866, the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> were expelled in consequence of the suppression of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. At present they are in possession of La Verna which belongs, however, to the municipality of Florence.
