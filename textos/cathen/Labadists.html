<h1>Labadists</h1>  

<p>A pietist <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries founded by Jean de Labadie, who was born at Bourg, near <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, 13 February, 1610, and died at Altonia, 13 February, 1674. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, joined their order in 1625, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> ten years later. Having left the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in 1639 he preached successfully at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, Paris, and Amiens, where in 1640 he was appointed canon and professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. He exercised his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions at Abbeville also, and in 1649 withdrew to the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Graville, near Havre, to avoid a conflict with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>. In 1650 he joined the Reformed Church of <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a>, where he was appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. In 1657 he took up pastoral work at Orange on the Rh&ocirc;ne, because extraordinary preacher at <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> in 1659, and seven years later accepted a call to the French-speaking congregation at Middelburg, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, where he refused to subscribe to the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Confession or to recognize the authority of the Reformed Church and founded a separate <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, whereupon he was expelled from the city. He then endeavoured to organize a community first in the neighbouring town of Veere, then at <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>, where he permanently won over to his cause the learned Anna Maria van Schurman. On the invitation of the princess-abbess, Elizabeth, he removed in 1670 with some fifty-five followers to Herford in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>. Having been banished also from this place in 1672, the congregation settled at Altona where De Labadie died. Shortly after his death, his followers, to the number of one hundred and sixty-two finally migrated from Altona to Wiewert in West Friesland. Here they reached the highest point of their prosperity, but even then did not number more than about four hundred. In 1680 they accepted an invitation from the governor of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> colony of Surinam to establish a missionary settlement in his dominions. But the colony of "Providence" which they founded disappeared in 1688. A similar attempted at New Bohemia on the Hudson in the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a> also ended in failure. The congregation of Wiewert itself dispersed in 1732. In their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> teaching, the Labadists laid great stress on the necessity of interior illumination by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> for the understanding of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for them was a community of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have been born again from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. These alone are entitled to the reception of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Hence they frowned upon infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, seldom celebrated the Lord's Supper, and declared that marriage with an unregenerate <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is not binding. They held <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in common, after the example of the primitive Church, supported themselves by manual labour and held very lax views regarding the observance of Sunday.
