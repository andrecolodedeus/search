<h1>Lady Elizabeth Herbert of Lea</h1>  

<p>Authoress, and philanthropist, b. in 1822; d. in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> 30 Oct., 1911. Lady Herbert was the daughter of General Charles A'Court, who was a member of Parliament as well as a soldier, while her uncle, who afterwards became Lord Heytesbury, was <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Ambassador at St. Petersburg. At the age of twenty-four Elizabeth A'Court, who moved in the best circles of early Victorian <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, married one of the most promising and independent of the young politicians of the day, Sidney Herbert, the second son of the Earl of <a href="../cathen/11611a.htm">Pembroke</a>. Naturally the wife made herself the sharer of her husband's interests. In the forties she was an ardent Peelite and, when young Herbert was made Secretary of War during the Crimean campaign, she became the ally and ardent helper of Florence Nightingale. In 1861 Sidney Herbert, shortly after being created Baron Herbert of Lea, died, leaving her a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> with four sons and three daughters. Two of her sons succeeded to the Earldom of <a href="../cathen/11611a.htm">Pembroke</a>, but only one of her children, who afterwards became by marriage Lady Mary von H&uuml;gel, followed Lady Herbert in her change of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. This took place at Palermo in 1866 and was largely due to the influence of <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a>, who had been the friend both of herself and of her husband. From the time of her <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> Lady Herbert became the centre and most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> promoter of all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charities and interests. The pen more especially was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the cause, and for many years she produced a large number of books in rapid succession, partly original and partly translations, which found for the most part a ready sale. Among the best known of these may be mentioned: "Impressions of Spain" (1866); "Cradle Lands", i.e. <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Palestine (1867); "Wives and Mothers of the Olden Time" (1871); "Wayside Tales" (1880). Besides these there several stories, some of them autobiographical and a number of Lives, mostly translated or abbreviated from French originals, e.g. those of St. Monica, <a href="../cathen/08449a.htm">St. John Baptist de Rossi</a>, <a href="../cathen/05202a.htm">Mgr. Dupanloup</a>, <a href="../cathen/06379b.htm">Garc&iacute;a Moreno</a>, Mgr. de Merode, etc. Lady Herbert was a familiar figure in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which she visited annually until almost the close of her long life.
