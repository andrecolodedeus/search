<h1>Lahore</h1>  

<p>(LAHLORENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in northern <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Province of <a href="../cathen/01225a.htm">Agra</a>. Its boundaries comprise the civil Province of the Punjab, except two small portions assigned to Kashmer and Agra respectively. It also includes the native state of Bahawulpur. Down to the sixteenth century <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> seems never to have come in touch with the Punjab. During the reign of Akbar, and in answer to his invitation, a mission of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> from <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> visited the Mogul court, spending part of their time at Fatehpur-Sikri and part at Lahore (1579-81). Akbar's successor, Jahangir, allowed some Portuguese <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to build a church and establish a mission at Lahore, and assigned a salary for their maintenance. This favor was, however, canceled by the next Mogul emperor, Shah Jahan, who, being a strict <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a>, withdrew the pension and ordered the church to be pulled down. Some fragments of it still remained when Lahore was visited by the French traveler Th&eacute;venot in 1665; but these have since been totally effaced, and from that time all traces of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> disappeared from the place. About 1637 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> established the Vicariate of the Deccan, which soon afterwards (1669) became the Vicariate of the Great Mogul, with an indefinite extension over the whole of the Mogul empire. But missionary enterprise was limited to the southern parts such as Surat, Golconda, Bijapur, etc., nothing being done for the Punjab. From 1720 this vicariate came to be centered in <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, and so acquired that name. In 1784 the northern portion, including the Punjab, was divided off and attached to the mission of <a href="../cathen/14718a.htm">Tibet</a>, which had been assigned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> in 1703. The Prefecture Apostolic of Tibet developed into the Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/01225a.htm">Agra</a> in 1822. It continued to include Lahore till 1880, when the Punjab was divided from <a href="../cathen/01225a.htm">Agra</a> and made into a separate vicariate. In 1882 the limits of the Vicariate of Lahore were more exactly defined and made to include Kashmer. In 1886, when the Indian <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was established, Agra was elevated into an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> with the Diocese of Lahore as one of its suffragans. In 1887 Kashmer and Kafiristan were separated into a new <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefecture Apostolic</a>. Down to 1889 the Lahore <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was in charge of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, but in that year it was taken over by the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> province of the same order in whose hands it now remains. The following is a list of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who have governed Lahore: <ul> <li>Paul Tosi, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13026a.htm">Rhodiopolis</a>, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Patna, took charge of the new vicariate on its formation in 1880 and became the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lahore in 1886; <li>Symphorian Mouard, transferred from the Seychelles in 1888; <li>Emmanuel van den Bosch, 1891, transferred to Agra in 1892; <li>Godfrey Pelckmans, 1892; <li>Fabian Anthony Eestermans, from 1905. </ul>

<p>Out of a total of 16,000,000 inhabitants the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is calculated at about 5700. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is served by 38 <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> fathers and contains 30 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. Of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> for boys there are the following: St. Anthony's High School, Lahore, for <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> and Eurasians, with 108 pupils; Anglo-vernacular <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, Dalwal, with 280 native pupils; St. Francis's primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, Lahore, under the Tertiary Brothers of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, with thirty <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>; elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at three other places with 300 pupils. Agricultural <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> at Maryabad, under the same tertiaries, with thirty <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. Educational establishments for girls: two under the Nuns of Jesus and Mary, namely, at Lahore with sixty boarders and sixty day-scholars, and at Sialkot with sixty-seven pupils; four under the Sisters of Charity, namely, St. Mary's Convent, Multan, with about eighty-six pupils, St. Joseph's Orphanage, Lahore, with ninety native pupils, including a foundling home and high class <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for native girls, Convent of the Sacred Heart, Dalhousie, with forty-six pupils; and St. Vincent's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> dispensary, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and catechumenate at Khushpur&mdash;two under the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Nuns of the Propagation of the Faith, namely, Convent School with catechumenate at Maryabad, with seventy-five children, and a <a href="../cathen/08038b.htm">lunatic asylum</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a> at Lahore. Total, 5 high schools, 15 middle or primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 2 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 5 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 1 home for abandoned children, 6 free dispensaries, and 1 <a href="../cathen/08038b.htm">lunatic asylum</a>. The missionary centres are at Lahore, Multan, Firozpur, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Dalhousie, Sialkot, Mean-Meer, Maryabad, Adah, Sahowala, Khushpur, Francisabad, and Lyallpur. A new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Lahore, in the Romanesque style, and of notable size and magnificence, built at a total cost of about four lacs of rupees, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 19 November, 1907.
