<h1>Laity</h1>  

<p>(Greek <em>laos</em>, "the people"; whence <em>laikos</em>, "one of the people").

<p><em>Laity</em> means the body of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, outside of the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. This article treats the subject under three heads: (1) General Idea; (2) Duties and Rights of the Laity; (3) Privileges and Restrictions of the Laity.
<h2>General idea</h2>

<p>Whereas the word <em>faithful</em> is opposed to infidel, unbaptized, one outside the pale of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, the word <em>laity</em> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The laity and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, belong to the same <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, but do not occupy the same rank. The laity are the members of this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> who remain where they were placed by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, even if only <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsured</a>, have been raised by <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to a higher class, and placed in the sacred <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is a perfect <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, though all therein are not equal; it is composed of two kinds of members (see can. "Duo sunt", vii, Caus. 12, Q. i, of uncertain origin): in the first place, those who are the depositaries of sacred or spiritual authority under its triple aspect, government, teaching, and worship, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the sacred <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> established by <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> (Conc. Trid., Sess. XXIII, can. vi); in the second place, those over whom this power is exercised, who are governed, taught, and sanctified, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people, the laity; though for that matter <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> also, considered as <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, are governed, taught, and sanctified. But the laity are not the depositaries of spiritual power; they are the flock confided to the care of the shepherds, the disciples who are instructed in the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the subjects who are guided by the successors of the Apostles towards the last end, which is eternal life. Such is the constitution which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Saviour</a> has given to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>This is not the place for a detailed demonstration of this assertion, the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of which may be reduced to the following points more fully developed under <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">CHURCH</a>: on the one hand, a distinction between the governed and those governing is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in every organized <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>; now <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> established His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a real <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, endowed with all the authority requisite for the attaining of its object. On the other hand, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, government has always been in the hands of those who were entrusted exclusively with the teaching of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and the care of Divine worship. If one studies without prejudice the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and the beginnings of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> may arise on certain matters of detail; but the conclusion will certainly be that every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community had its superiors, these superiors had a stable spiritual authority, and this authority had as its end the exclusive care of religious functions (including teaching) as well as the government of the community. There have been differences of opinion concerning the origin of the monarchial <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>, which soon became the sole form of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization; but no one holds that the monarchial <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a> succeeded a period of <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a> or of government by a community where all had equal authority. The organization of all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Churches</a> under the authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, as early as the third century, is so evident as to place beyond all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the existence at that time of two distinct classes, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the laity. Moreover, in all <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> among which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had spread, religious service had already its special <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> organization would have retrograded if its worship and its sacrifice had not been entrusted exclusively to a special class.

<p>Christ selected the Apostles from among His disciples, and among the Apostles He selected Peter to be their head. He entrusted them with the furtherance of His work; to them he confided the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>, i.e. spiritual authority, for they are the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of Heaven</a> (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs19">Matthew 16:19</a>); He gave them the mission to teach and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> all nations (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs18">Matthew 28:18</a>); to them also He addressed those words at the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a>: Do this in commemoration of me" (<a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs19">Luke 22:19</a>). As soon as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> begins to live, the Apostles appear as its leaders; they are distinct from the "multitude of believers"; it is into their ranks that they bring Matthias (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs15">Acts 1:15</a>), and later, by the command of the Holy Ghost, Saul and Barnabas, whom they receive with the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> (<a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs2">Acts 13:2</a>). Wherever <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> founds Churches he gives them leaders "placed by the Holy Spirit to govern the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>" (<a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs28">Acts 20:28</a>); the Pastoral Epistles reveal to us a directing body composed of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> (<a href="../fathers/1010.htm"><em>Epistle of Clement</em> 43.4</a>); and they it is, especially the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who perform exclusively the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> services (Ignatius, <a href="../fathers/0109.htm"><em>Smyrn&aelig;ans</em> 8</a>). If at times the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people participate in the Divine service or the government, they never appear acting independently nor even on an equal footing with the heads of the community (cf. Batiffol, "L'&Eacute;glise naissante et le catholicisme", Paris, 1909). This distinction between the two classes in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> refers to social rank, not to individual <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">moral perfection</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, being dedicated to the service of the altar, are thereby bound to strive after perfection; yet neither their virtues not their failing influence in any way their powers. On the other hand, the laity, besides their right to aspire freely to admission into the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, on complying with the requisite conditions, are exhorted to practise every virtue, even in the highest degree. They can also bind themselves to observe the evangelical counsels, under the guidance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, either in the world, as did the ancient ascetics, or by withdrawing from the world into one of the many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>. But ascetics, <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and unordained members of religious associations of men were not originally in the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and, strictly speaking, are not so even today, though, on account of their closer and more special dependence on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, they have long been included under the title <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in its wider sense (see RELIGIOUS). The juridical condition of the laity in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is therefore determined by two considerations: their separation from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, which excludes them from the performance of acts reserved to the latter; and second, their subjection to the spiritual authority of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, which imposes certain <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> on them, while at the same time it confers on them certain <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>.


<h2>Duties and rights of the laity</h2>

<p>Having come through Baptism to the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> life, being members of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and adopted children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the laity belong to the "chosen race", the "royal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>" (<a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#vrs9">1 Peter 2:9</a>) formed of all those who are born again in Christ. They have therefore a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to share in the common spiritual goods of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, which implies a corresponding <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> on the part of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to bestow on them these goods, in as far as this bestowal requires the intervention of the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of religion and of the spiritual authority. But if the laity are to share in these common goods they must employ more or less frequently the means of sanctification instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> in His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and of which the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> have been put in charge. Further, the laity, being subject to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, must obey and respect it; but in return they have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to obtain from it direction, protection, and service. Thus, for the laity <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> are, as always, correlative. The first <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is to believe; the first <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> imparted to the laity is, therefore, to learn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and of religion, at first by means of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> and religious instruction, and later by being present at sermons, missions, or retreats. If they are thus <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to learn, they have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to be instructed and consequently to require their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to give them and their children <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian teaching</a> in the ordinary way. Second, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian's</a> moral conduct should be in keeping with his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; he must, therefore, preserve his spiritual life by the means which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> has established in His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; The Divine service, especially the Mass, the Sacraments, and other sacred rites.

<p>This necessity of having recourse to the pastoral ministry gives rise to a right in the laity as regards the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the right of obtaining from them the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, especially Penance and the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, and others according to circumstances; also all the other acts of <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Christian worship</a>, especially the Mass, the <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a> and other rites, and lastly <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">Christian burial</a>. These are the spiritual goods destined for the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; if the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are appointed to administer them, they are not free dispensers, and they are bound to give their services to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, as long, at least, as the latter have not by their own fault placed themselves in a condition that deprives them of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to demand these services. Considered from the standpoint of the laity, this recourse to the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> is sometimes <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> and sometimes optional, according to circumstances. It may be an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> imposed by a command of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or necessitated by personal reasons; in other cases, it may be a matter of counsel and left to the devotion of each one. This is a subject which exhibits most clearly the difference between a precept and a counsel with regard to our outward <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life. Assistance at Mass on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and holy days of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, annual confession, <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> communion, the reception of the viaticum and the last services of religion, the celebration of marriage in the prescribed form, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and religious instruction of children, and, finally, the rites of <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">Christian burial</a>---all these suppose a recourse to the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> which is of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> for the laity, abstracting from individual cases when there may be a legitimate excuse. On the other hand, more or less frequent confessions and communions, hearing of daily Mass, frequenting the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, asking for special ceremonies (for instance, churching) celebration of Masses, obtaining services and <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers for the dead</a> or for other intentions, are things that are perfectly legitimate and are counselled, but are optional. We may also mention the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> or free acts intended for the personal sanctification of the laity, but which do not require the help of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>: private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and abstinence, avoidance of servile work on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and holy days of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, and, lastly, in general all that relates to the moral life and the observance of the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">commandments of God</a>.

<p>From these <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> and optional relations existing between the laity and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> there arise certain <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the former towards the latter. In the first place, respect and deference should be shown to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, especially in the exercise of their function, on account of their sacred character and the Divine authority with which they are invested (Conc. Trid., Sess. XXV, c. xx). This respect should be shown in daily intercourse, and laymen inspired with a truly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> spirit do homage to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of His <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, even when the conduct of the latter is not in keeping with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of their state. In the second place the laity are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a>, in proportion to their means and circumstances of the case, to contribute towards the expenses of Divine service and the fitting support of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; this is an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> incumbent on them in return for the right which they have to the services of their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with regard to the Mass and other spiritual exercises. These contributions fall under two distinct classes: certain gifts and offerings of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are intended in general for the Divine services and the support of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; others, on the contrary, are connected with various acts of the sacred ministry which are freely asked for, such as the stipends for Masses, the dues for funeral services, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, etc. There is no fixed sum for the former class, the matter being left to the generosity of the faithful; in many countries they have taken the place of the fixed incomes that the various churches and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were possessed of, arising especially from landed <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>; they have likewise replaced the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, no longer recognized by the secular governments. The latter class, however, are fixed by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority or custom and may be demanded in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; not that this is paying for sacred things, which would be <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, but they are offerings for the Divine service and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> on the occasion of certain definite acts (see <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">OFFERINGS</a>; <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">TITHES</a>).

<p>There remains to speak of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the laity towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority as such, in matters foreign to the sacred ministry. The <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, which affect both laity and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, consist in submission and obedience to legitimate hierarchical authority: the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and, in a proportionate degree, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and other acting <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. The decisions, judgments, orders, and directions of our lawful <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, in matters of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, discipline, and even administration, must be accepted and obeyed by all members of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, at least in as far as they are subject to that authority. That is a condition requisite to the well-being of any <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> whatsoever. However, in the case of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, authoritative decisions and directions, in as far as they are concerned with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, bind not merely to exterior acts and formal obedience; they are, moreover, a matter of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and demand loyal interior acceptance. On the other hand, seeing that in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the superiors have been established for the welfare of the subjects, so that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself glories in the title "servant of the servants of God", the faithful have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to expect the care, vigilance, and protection of their <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>; in particular they have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to refer their disputes to the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> for decision, to consult them in case of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> or difficulty, and to ask for suitable guidance for their religious or moral conduct.
<h2>Privileges and restrictions of the laity</h2>

<p>Since the laity is distinct from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and since Divine worship, <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> teaching, and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> government are reserved, at least in essentials, to the latter, it follows that the former may not interfere in purely <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> offices; they can participate only in a secondary and accessory manner, and that in virtue of a more or less explicit authorization. Any other interference would be an unlawful and guilty usurpation, punishable at times with censures and penalties. We will apply this principle now to matters of worship, teaching, and government or administration.
<h3 id="A">As to the liturgy</h3>

<p>As to Divine service, the liturgy and especially the essential act of the <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Christian worship</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>, the active <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> are the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> alone. But the laity really join in it. Not only do they assist at the Sacrifice and receive its spiritual effects, but they offer it through the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Formerly they could, and even were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to, bring and offer at the altar the mater of the sacrifice, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>; that is what they really do today by their offerings and their stipends for Masses. At several parts of the Mass, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> mention them as offering the sacrifice together with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, especially in the passage immediately after the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>: "Unde et memores, nos servi tui (the clergy) sed et plebs tua sancta (the laity) . . . offerimus praeclare Majestati tuae, de tuis donis ac datis", etc. The laity reply to the salutations and invitations of the celebrant, thus joining in the solemn <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; especially do they share in the Holy Victim by <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> (confined for them in the Latin Liturgy to the species of bread), which they can receive also outside of the time of Mass and at home in case of illness. Such is the participation of the laity in the Liturgy, and strictly they are limited to that; all the active portion is performed by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>.

<p>Regularly, no layman may sit within the <em>presbyterium</em>, or sanctuary, nor may he read any part of the Liturgy, much less <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> publicly, or serve the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at the altar, or, above all, offer the Sacrifice. However, owing to the almost complete disappearance of the inferior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, there has gradually arisen the custom of appointing lay persons to perform certain minor <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. In most of our churches, the choirboys, schoolboys, <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacristans</a>, and chanters, serve low Masses and <em>Missae cantatae</em>, occupy places in the sanctuary, and act as <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>, thurifers, masters of ceremonies, and even as <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a>. On such occasions they are given, at least in solemn services, a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> costume, the cassock and <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a>, as if to admit them temporarily to the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and thus recognize and safeguard the principle of excluding the laity. These remarks apply not only to the celebration of Mass, but to all <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> services: the laity are separated from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In processions especially, confraternities and other bodies of the laity precede the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> being first, then the men, next <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and lastly the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>.

<p>In the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a>, and other like <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> offices, the same principle applies, and ordinarily everything is reserved to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. But it should be mentioned that the laity may administer <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in cases of necessity, and though not of practical importance with regard to adults, this frequently occurs when children are in danger of death. In the early ages, the faithful carried away the Blessed Eucharist to their homes and gave themselves the <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "Ad uxorem", ii, 5). That was a purely material administration of the sacrament, and hardly differed from the communion <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> in the church, where the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> host was placed in the hand of each communicant. We should mention also that the use of the blessed oil by those who were sick, if that be considered an administration of extreme unction (cf. the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> of <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> to Decentius of Eugubium, n. 8; serm. cclxv and cclxxix; append. of the works of St. Augustine, really the work of St. Caesarius of Arles). But those practices have long since disappeared. As to matrimony, if the sacrament itself, which is none other than the contract, has as its authors the lay persons contracting, the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> administration is reserved today, as formerly, to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. With these exceptions, there is nothing to prevent the laity from using the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in their <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">private devotions</a>, from reciting the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, or the various Little Offices drawn up particularly for them, or from joining in associations or confraternities to practise together and according to rule certain <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> exercises, the confraternities having been formed lawfully in virtue of episcopal <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>.
<h3 id="B">As to doctrine</h3>

<p>The body of the faithful is strictly speaking the <em>Ecclesia docta</em> (the Church taught), in contrast with the <em>Ecclesia docens</em> (the teaching Church), which consists of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. When there is question, therefore, of the official teaching of religious <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, the laity is neither competent nor authorized to speak in the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (cap. xii et sq., lib. V, tit. vii, "de haereticis"). Consequently they are not allowed to preach in church, or to undertake to defend the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> in public discussions with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. But in their private capacity, they may most lawfully defend and teach their religion by word and writing, while submitting themselves to the control and guidance of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. Moreover, they may be appointed to give <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> instruction more or less officially, or may even become the defenders of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Thus they give excellent help to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in teaching <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, the lay masters in our <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> give religious instruction, and some laymen have received a missio canonica, or due <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authorization, to teach the religious <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> in <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>; the important point in this, as in other matters, is for them to be submissive to the legitimate teaching authority.
<h3 id="C">As to jurisdiction and administration</h3>

<p>The principle is that the laity as such have no share in the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> and government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but they may be commissioned or delegated by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority to exercise certain <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, especially when there is no question of strictly <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a>, for instance, in the administration of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The laity are incapable, if not by <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> at least by canon law, of real <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, according to chap. x, "De constit." (lib. I. tit. ii): "Attendentes quod laicis etiam religiosis super ecclesiis et personis ecclesiasticis nulla sit atributa facultas, quos obsequendi manet necessitas non auctoritas imperandi", i.e., the laity have no authority over things or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>; it is their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to obey not to command. Therefore no official acts requiring real <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> can be properly performed by the laity; if performed by them, they are null and void. A layman therefore cannot be at the head of a Church or any <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community, nor can he legislate in spiritual matters, no act as judge in essentially <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> cases. In particular, the laity (and by this word we here include the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authority</a>) cannot bestow <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> on <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> under the form of an election properly so called, conferring the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to an episcopal or other <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. An election by the laity alone, or one in which the laity took part, would be absolutely null and void (c. lvi, "De elect.") (see <a href="../cathen/05374b.htm">ELECTION</a>). But this refers to canonical election strictly so called, conferring <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to receive it; if it is merely a question, on the other hand, of selecting an individual, either by way or presentation or a similar process, the laity are not excluded, for the <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a>, the source of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a>, is exclusively reserved to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. That is why no objection can be raised against the principle we have laid down from the fact that the people took part in the episcopal elections in the first ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; to speak more accurately, the people manifested their wish rather than took part in the election; the real electors were the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>; and lastly, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were present were the judges of the election, so that in reality the final decision rested in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. It cannot be denied that in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> encroached on the ground of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a>, especially in the case of episcopal elections; but the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> always asserted her claim to independence where <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> was involved, as may be clearly seen in the history of the famous dispute about investitures (q.v.).

<p>When <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> properly so called is duly protected, and there is question of administering temporal goods, the laity may and do enjoy as a fact real <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> recognized by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The most important is that of presentation or election in the wide sense of the term, now known as <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a>, by which certain laymen select for the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whom they wish to see invested with certain <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> or offices. The best known example is that of <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to sees and other <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> by temporal princes, who have obtained that privilege by <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordats</a>. Another case recognized and carefully provided for in canon law is the right of patronage. This right is granted to those who from their own resources have established a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> or who have at least amply endowed it (contributing more than one-third of the revenue). The patrons can, from the moment of foundation, reserve to themselves and their descendants, the right of active and passive patronage, not to mention other privileges rather honorary in their nature; in exchange for these <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, they undertake to protect and maintain their foundation. The right of active patronage consists principally in the presentation of the cleric to be invested with the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>, provided he fulfils the requisite conditions. The right of passive patronage consists in the fact that the candidates for the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> are to be selected from the descendants or the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the founder. The patrons enjoy by right a certain precedence, among other things the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to a more prominent seat in the churches founded or supported by them; sometimes, also, they enjoy other honours; they can reserve to themselves a part in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>; finally, if they fall upon <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> days, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to help them from the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> that was acquired through the generosity of their ancestors. All these <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, it is clear, and particularly that of presentation, are concessions made by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and not privileges which the laity have of their own right.

<p>It is but equitable that those who furnish the resources required by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should not be excluded from their administration. For that reason the participation of the laity in the administration of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, especially <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, is justified. Under the different names such as, "building councils", "parish councils", "trustees", etc., and with rules carefully drawn up or approved by the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>, and often even recognized by the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, there exist almost everywhere administrative organizations charged with the care of the temporal goods of churches and other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> establishments; most of the members are laymen; they are selected in various ways, generally co-option, subject to the approval of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But this honourable office does not belong to the laity in their own right; it is a privilege granted to them by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which alone has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to administer her own <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> (Conc. Plen. Baltim. III, n. 284 sq.); they must conform to the regulations and act under the control of the ordinary, with whom ultimately the final decision rests; lastly and above all, they must confine their energies to temporal administration and never encroach on the reserved domain of spiritual things (Conc. Plen. Baltim. II, n. 201; see <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">ECCLESIASTICAL BUILDINGS</a>). Lastly, there are many <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, founded and directed by laymen, and which are not strictly <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, though they are regularly subject to the control of the ordinary (Conc. Trid., Seess. VII, c. xv; Sess. XXII, c. viii); the material side of these works is not the most important, and to attain their end, the laity who govern there will above all be guided and directed by the advice of their <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, whose loyal and respectful auxiliaries they will prove themselves to be.
