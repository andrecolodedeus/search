<h1>Lajos Haynald</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Kalocsa-B&aacute;cs in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>; b. at Sz&eacute;cs&eacute;ny, 3 October, 1816; d. at Kalocsa, 3 July, 1891. Having completed his studies in the secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, he entered the Emericianum at Pozsony (Presburg) in 1830, remaining there for one year. He studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at Nagyszombat (Tyrnau) in 1831, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1833; entered <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> on 15 October, 1839, and received the degree of Doctor of Theology in 1841. After a brief period spent in the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, he became professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a> in 1842. The prince-primate, Kop&aacute;csy, appointed him his secretary in 1846, but before he had entered upon the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of that office, dispatched him abroad to study the training of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration. Haynald probably was the first Hungarian to study such subjects in foreign countries. He applied himself to these questions with especial diligence in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he passed most of the time that he spent on his mission. On his return he was appointed chancellor-director to the prince-primate, early in 1848. When the Hungarian parliament proclaimed the independence of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> on 14 April, 1849, Haynald refused to publish this declaration. The consequence was that he lost his position, whereupon he returned to his birth-place Sz&eacute;cs&eacute;ny. At the close of the Revolutionary War he was restored to his office; on 15 September, 1851, he was appointed coadjutor to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>, Nicholas Kov&aacute;cs, whom he succeeded on 15 October, 1852. On the publication of the October diploma, in 1860, Haynald became one of the champions of the union of <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> with <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. His political opinions and activity thereupon brought him into conflict with the <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Viennese</a> Government. Count Francis N&aacute;dasdy, head of the <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvanian</a> Chancellery, accused Haynald of disloyalty. Haynald went to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and presented a memorial in which he set forth his political views. Notwithstanding this, the dissensions between the Government and Haynald continued, and resulted in Haynald's resignation in 1864. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> summoned him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and appointed him titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>.

<p>Until 1867 he laboured in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he did valuable work as a member of the Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs. After the restoration of the Hungarian constitution, Haynald was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Kalocsa-B&aacute;cs, in 1867, at the instance of Baron Joseph E&ouml;tv&ouml;s. He played an important part in the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> of 1870, being, with George Strossmayer, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Diakov&aacute; r, one of the foremost opponents of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">Infallibility</a>, although he submitted to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the council. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> made Haynald a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1879. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, he aimed chiefly to maintain <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> and to raise the standard of studies in the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. His <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequests amounted to nearly five millions of gulden. While still a young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> he devoted himself earnestly to the study of botany and made a large collection of plants and of books, which subsequently came into the possession of the Hungarian National Museum. The Hungarian Academy of Sciences made him an honorary member in recognition of his scientific work.
