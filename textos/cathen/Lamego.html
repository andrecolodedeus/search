<h1>Lamego</h1>  

<p>(LAMECENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> situated in the district of <a href="../cathen/15496b.htm">Vizeu</a>, province of Beira, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. The city has a Gothic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, with a high tower, and a <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> castle, and is known as the meeting-place of the famous parliament of 1143, which settled the royal succession for the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and established the old <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> Cortes, convened for the last time in 1698; the Cortes of Lamego spoken of in modern Portuguese history is the one called by Dom Miguel after he had dissolved the constitution in 1828. According to local but untenable tradition the city received the Gospel from St. James the Greater, or <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. Many Portuguese authorities mention as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lamego Petrus Rathensis, who is said to have been a disciple of the Apostle St. James, and who subsequently became first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> and a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">ARCHDIOCESE OF BRAGA</a>). The authentic history of the See of Lamego begins with Bishop Sardinarius, whose signature appears in connection with the Second (Third) Council of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> (572) among the suffragans of the well-known Mart&iacute;n of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a>. Shortly before this, at the Council of <a href="../cathen/09417b.htm">Lugo</a> (569), at the commission of King Theodomir, several new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were created. It is probable, therefore, that the foundation of the See of Lamego took place between 569 and 572. Among its early <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are: Philippus (c. 580-89), Profuturus (c. 630-38), Witaricus (c. 646), Filimirus (653-56), but scarcely more than their names is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. In 666 a new circumscription of the Lusitanian sees was made, by which Lamego was placed under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/10202a.htm">M&eacute;rida</a> (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, "Conciliengeschichte", III, 2nd ed., Freiburg im Br., 110). From 693 to 876 there is a gap in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> list of Lamego. On the invasion of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> in 714, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lamego, like many of his contemporaries, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to take refuge in the Asturias. It is not until 876 that we again come across a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lamego, Argimirus (Fl&oacute;rez, "Espa&ntilde;a Sagrada), who is apparently identical with Argimirus (II) who, in 899, took part in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/04187b.htm">Compostela</a> (cf. L&oacute;pez Ferreiro, "Historia de la Santa A. M. Iglesia de Santiago de Compostela", II, Santiago, 1899, 192). It is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> if even the few known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Lamego who are mentioned during the time of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> (except Argimirus, Brandericus, Pantaleon, and Jacobus) resided at all at Lamego; it is probable that they were only <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, especially as Almansur of <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a> destroyed the city in 982. This confusion lasted till Ferdinand the Great reconquered the city in 1057 (or 1038?) and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was reorganized. In 1071 a Bishop Peter of Lamego is mentioned in a deed of gift by the Infanta Urraca, daughter of Ferdinand the Great, to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/15105a.htm">Tuy</a>. The see seems to have been vacant for several decades, as is evident from a letter of <a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">Pope Paschal II</a> (1099-1118) to Bishop Mauritius of Coimbra. When <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> was established as an independent kingdom, in 1143, by Alfonso I, the See of Lamego was revived and the Augustinian Mendo Godinu. (d. 1176) became the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. It was at that time a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a>. At the instance of Archbishop Peter of Santiago de Compostela, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, in 1199, re-arranged the Dioceses of Coimbra, <a href="../cathen/15496b.htm">Vizeu</a>, Lamego, and Egitania (the present Guarda), allotting the first two to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> and the last two to Santiago de Compostela (Fl&oacute;rez, op. cit., IV, 274 sqq.; L&oacute;pez Ferreiro, op. cit., V, 29 sqq.). Lamego remained a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/04187b.htm">Compostela</a> until the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> was established in 1394, after which it was a suffragan of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was enlarged in 1430, when the district of Riba Coa was ceded to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> by the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>. Until then this district had belonged to the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/03793e.htm">See of Ciudad Rodrigo</a>, but once joined to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, it became part of the Diocese of Lamego. <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> (10 July, 1770) created the Diocese of Pinhel (Pinelensis) in the aforesaid district, which, however, was suppressed by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Gravissimum" (30 Sept., 1881), which replaced Lamego under the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> and gave new limits to the diocese.

<p>Lamego is bounded on the east by the <a href="../cathen/07049a.htm">Diocese of Guarda</a>, on the south by that of <a href="../cathen/15496b.htm">Vizeu</a>, on the west by Coimbra, on the north by Porto and Braga; it has (1909) 273,741 inhabitants, almost entirely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, 283 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 283 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, 1144 public <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 314 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, one college for boys at Lamego conducted by <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>; 2 houses of <a href="../cathen/xxyyyk.htm">Portuguese</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, one house of <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Cluny, and one of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1910) is Francisco Jos&eacute; de Vieira e Brito, who was born 5 June, 1850, at Rendufinho (<a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Archdiocese of Braga</a>), studied at <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, was professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a>, also canon and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> there. On 13 Jan., 1892, he was nominated to the <a href="../cathen/01513c.htm">See of Angra</a> (Azores), and in 1902 was transferred to Lamego. He restored the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> palace, enlarged the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and assisted in the foundation of a new <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> workingmen's club.
