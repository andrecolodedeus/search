<h1>Lampsacus</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> of Hellespont, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a>. The city is situated in Mysia, at the entrance to the Hellespont, opposite Callipolis, in a region known as Bebrycia, which seems to indicate an establishment of Bebryces from Thrace. It was probably called Pityussa prior to its colonization by the Ionian cities of <a href="../cathen/12040b.htm">Phoc&aelig;a</a> and <a href="../cathen/10303c.htm">Miletus</a>. The elder Miltiades, when he had been established in possession of Thracian Chersonesus, declared <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the inhabitants of Lampsacus, who made him <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, and released him only in submission to the threats of Croesus. During the Ionian revolt Lampsacus fell into the power of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>. The "great king" gave its territory to Themistocles that he might supply himself with its wine, which was very famous; but the city itself continued to be governed by native tyrants. After the battle of Mycale (479 B.C.), Lampsacus joined the Athenians, but revolted after the unsuccessful expedition to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>; being unfortified, however, it was easily recaptured by the fleet of Strombichides. After the death of Alexander, it was forced to defend itself against the attacks of Antiochus of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. It voted a golden crown to the Romans and became their ally. Its prosperity continued under the empire; gold and silver staters of Lampsacus are extant, and its <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of the imperial period range from <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> to <a href="../cathen/06366a.htm">Gallienus</a>. The city possessed a fine piece of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> by Lysippus, representing a lion couchant, which was carried off by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Agrippa</a> to grace the Campus Martius at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> It was the home of many famous men, e.g. the historian Charon, Anaximenes the orator, Adimantus, and Metrodorus, a disciple of <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> who himself lived at Lampsacus for three years. It must be added that the city was also <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> for the obscene worship that was paid to Priapus. Its name has been conjecturally introduced into the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> (<a href="../bible/1ma015.htm#vrs23">1 Maccabees 15:23</a>) in place of the Greek name Sampsace, or Sampsame, in the list of the cities to which the letter of the consul Leucius was sent; and this correction is an excellent one, since no city was known by the name of Sampsace or Sampsame.

<p>St. Trypho, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at <a href="../cathen/11043a.htm">Nicaea</a>, was, according to the legend, buried at Lampsacus. Its first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was St. Parthenius, under Constantine. In 364 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was occupied by Marcian, a <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a> or Macedonian; in that year there was held at Lampsacus a council of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the majority of whom belonged to that party. Marcian, summoned to the &OElig;cumenical Council of Constantinople, in 381, refused to retract. Other known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Lampsacus were Daniel, who assisted at the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451); Harmonius (458); Constantine (680), present at the Council of Constantinople; John (787), at <a href="../cathen/11043a.htm">Nicaea</a>; St. Euschemon, a correspondent of St. Theodore the Studite, and a confessor of the Faith for the veneration of images, under Theophilus. The See of Lampsacus is mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/11124b.htm">"Notitiae episcopatuum"</a> until about the twelfth or thirteenth century. Lampsacus is now a village of about two thousand inhabitants, the chief place of a caza in the sanjak of Bigha; it is called in Greek Lampsaki, and in <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Lepsek.
