<h1>Langheim</h1>  

<p>A celebrated <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> situated in Upper Franconia (Bavaria), not far from Mein, in the <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Diocese of Bamberg</a>. Three brothers of the city of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> made a gift of the estate of Langheim to Bishop <a href="../cathen/11353a.htm">St. Otto</a> VIII, who, in 1132, offered it to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> of the Abbey of Ebrac (which was itself founded by Morimond), under the condition that they should establish there a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of their order. Encouraged by <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>, Adam, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Ebrac, accepted the offer. On 1 August, 1132, he laid the corner stone of the new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and in 1142 the buildings were completed. The first to rule this community was Abbot Adam (1141-80), who, by his wisdom and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, won the sympathy of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> and of the nobles of the surrounding country for the new foundation. Very soon the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> found itself in possession of considerable revenues, and had a large number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> depending upon it. <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Pope Eugene III</a> and the emperors granted it many privileges. All the ancient historians of the order agree in saying that it surpassed every other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in splendor and wealth, while one of its distinctive characteristics was the generous hospitality which it extended to all visitors. But this era of prosperity endured scarcely more than two centuries, for in 1385 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> seized part of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and in 1429 the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> destroyed the buildings by fire. After these misfortunes it arose again from its ruins, and enjoyed a return of prosperity, until, in 1535, the revolted peasants applied the torch and reduced all once more to ashes. After the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> had been rebuilt, a period of peace ensued, but in 1632 the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> hordes delivered it up to pillage, subjected the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to every outrage, and left nothing but misery and desolation in their train. It was not until the following century that Abbot Stephen M&ouml;singer (1734-51) had the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> reconstructed in such proportions and with a splendor that recalled the first <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. During this interval the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had again become favorable to the religious, but failed to restore either the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> they had usurped or the old-time privileges. The final catastrophe occurred on 7 May, 1802, when fire destroyed the splendid buildings erected by Stephen Mosinger and put an end to Langheim. On 23 June, 1803, the community, at that time numbering forty-nine members, was secularized by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Prince Elector of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. The religious were dispersed to various places, and the last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Candide Hemmerlein, received a pension of 8000 florins, with which he retired to the Castle of Thieb, where he died in 1814.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> gave to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who distinguished themselves by their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in combating <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and in laboring for the conversion of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; it also sheltered many writers who were not without merit. We may here mention the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Engelrich, who wrote the "Leben der hl. Mathilde, Abtissin von Edelstetten"; Simon Schreiner of the seventeenth century, who composed a treatise on the "Vierzehnheiligen", and an "Apologia contra Lutheranos". The Abbot Moritz Knauer, a distinguished mathematician and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, published different works on the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, also an <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> work entitled "Tuba Coeli" (1649-64); but the most prolific author was Joachim H. Jaeck, who, after his secularization, published the results of his researches on the history of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> and the surrounding country. In 1210 Langheim founded the Abbey of Plass in the Diocese of Prague, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. In 1445 Abbot Frederick Hengelein built at Frankenthal, as a dependence of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, a church in honor of the "Fourteen Holy Helpers", which soon became a celebrated and much frequented place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>. The care of this church is now confided to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>.
