<h1>Langres</h1>  

<p>(LINGON&AElig;).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> comprising the Department of the Haute-Marne. Suppressed by the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a>, Langres was later united to the <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Diocese of Dijon</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> bore the title of <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a> and Langres, but the union was never quite complete; there was a pro-vicar-general for the Haute-Marne and two <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> at Langres, the <em>petit s&eacute;minaire</em> from 1809 and the <em>grand s&eacute;minaire</em> from 1817. The See of Langres was re-established in 1817 by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> and Louis XVIII; and Mgr de la Luzerne, its pre-Revolution <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was to have been re-appointed; but the parliament did not ratify this agreement, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a> remained administrators of the Diocese of Langres till 6 October, 1822, when the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Paternae charitatis" definitely re-established the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Langres governed 360 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the old Diocese of Langres, 70 of the old Diocese of Ch&acirc;lons, 13 of the old Diocese of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>, 13 of the old <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Diocese of Troyes</a>, and 94 of the old Diocese of Toul. For the legends concerning the Apostolic origin of the See of Langres and the mission of <a href="../cathen/02479b.htm">St. Benignus</a> see <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">DIJON</a>.

<p>Mgr Duchesne considers Senator, Justus, and St. Desiderius (Didier), who was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> during the invasion of the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> (about 407), as the first three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Langres; the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, therefore, must have been founded about the middle of the fourth century. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who, till 1016, resided at <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, and exercised till 1731 <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> over the territory of the present <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Diocese of Dijon</a> we must mention: St. Martin (411-20); St. Urban (425-40); St. Paulinus (440-50); St. Aprunculus, the friend of Sidonius Apollinaris and his successor in the <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">See of Clermont</a> (470-84); St. Gregory (509-39), great-grandfather of <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a>, who transferred the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/02479b.htm">St. Benignus</a>; St. Tetricus, son of St. Gregory (539-72), whose coadjutor was St. Monderic, brother of St. Arnoul, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>; Blessed Migetius (589-618); St. Herulphus (759-74), founder of the <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Abbey of Ellwangen</a>; Blessed Arnoul (774-8); Betto (790-820), who helped to draw up the capitularies of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>; Venerable Isaac (859-80), author of a collection of canons; Venerable Argrin (889-909); Blessed Bruno of Roucy (980-1015), who brought in the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Cluny to reform the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; Venerable Lambert (1015-30), who ceded to King Robert of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the lordship and county of <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, in 1016; Venerable Gauthier of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> (1163-79); Robert de Torote (1232-40), who became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> in 1240, and established the feast of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>; Bertrand de Got (1306-07), uncle of <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>; Venerable Sebastian Zamet (1615-54), whose <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, Charles de Condren, became later Superior General of the Oratory, and who gave the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Langres to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in 1630; C&eacute;sar Guillaume de la Luzerne, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1770, celebrated as an <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a>, deputy to the States General in 1789, and an <em>&eacute;migr&eacute;</em> in 1791. He resigned in 1801, was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and again nominated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Langres in 1817, dying in 1821; Pierre Louis Parisis (1835-51), celebrated for the part he took in the Assembly of 1848 in the discussions on the liberty of teaching (<em>libert&eacute; d'enseignement</em>) and for founding the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> college of St. Dizier even before the <em>Loi Falloux</em> (see <a href="../cathen/05772b.htm">FALLOUX DU COUDRAY</a>) was definitely passed. Hugh III, Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, in 1179 gave the city of Langres to his uncle, Gautier of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; later it was made a duchy, which gave the Duke-Bishop of Langres, as the third <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> peer, the right of precedence over his <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>The chief patron of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, Saint Mammes of Caesarea (third century), to whom the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, a beautiful monument of the late twelfth century, is dedicated. The Diocese of Langres honors as <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> a number of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who, according to the <a href="../cathen/02479b.htm">St. Benignus</a> legend, died in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a>, the triplets, Saints Speusippus, Eleusippus, and Melapsippus; St. Neo, the author of their Acts, himself a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, St. Leonilla, their grandmother, and St. Junilla, their mother. Among other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> we may cite St. Valerius (Valier), a disciple of St. Desiderius, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> in the fifth century; the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> St. Godo (Gou), nephew of St. Vandrillus, in the seventh century; St. Gengulphus, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, in the eighth century; Venerable Gerard Voinchet (1640-95), canon regular of the Congregation of St. Genevi&egrave;ve in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, called the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> of that congregation; Venerable <a href="../cathen/09584a.htm">Jeanne Mance</a> (1606-73); Venerable Mariet, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who died in 1704; Venerable Joseph Urban Hanipaux, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, the latter three natives of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and celebrated for their apostolic labors in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was also the birthplace of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, Nicolas de Cl&eacute;menges (fourteenth-fifteenth century), who was canon and treasurer of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Langres; and of the Gallican canonist Edmond Richer (1560-1631); of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Pierre Lemoine, author of an epic poem of St. Louis and of the work "La d&eacute;votion ais&eacute;e" (1602-71); of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Diderot (1713-84). The historian, <a href="../cathen/06574b.htm">Raoul Glaber</a>, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Cluny, who died in 1050, was at the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of St. L&eacute;ger in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, when he was touched by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> on the occasion of an apparition. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Poulangy was founded in the eleventh century. The Abbey of Morimond, the fourth foundation of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, was established in 1125 by Odolric, lord of Aigremont, and Simon, Count of Bassigny. Blessed Otho, son of Leopold of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Morimund, became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Freising in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and returned in 1154 to die a simple <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in Morimond. The Augustinian <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of the Val des Ecoliers was founded in 1212, at Luzy, near Chaumont by four <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">Paris University</a>, who were led into this awful solitude by a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of retreat.

<p>A religious festival, the "Scourging of the <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>" at Langres, now no longer observed, was quite celebrated in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. On the day when, according to the ritual, the <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a> was omitted from the liturgy, a top on which the word <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a> was written was whipped out of church, to the singing of psalms, by the choirboys, who wished it <em>bon voyage</em> till <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. The "Pardon of Chaumont" is very celebrated. Jean de Montmirail, a native of Chaumont, and a particular friend of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, obtained from him, in 1475, that each time the feast of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a> fell on a Sunday, the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, who, having confessed their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, visited the church of Chaumont, should enjoy the jubilee <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>. Such was the origin of the great "Pardon" of Chaumont, celebrated sixty-one times, between 1476 and 1905. At the end of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, this "Pardon" gave rise to certain curious festivities; on stages erected throughout the town were represented fifteen mysteries of the life of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>, while frolics of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> who figured in the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, through the town and the country, on the Sunday preceding the "Pardon", drew multitudes to the festivities, which were finally called the "deviltries" of Chaumont. In the course of the eighteenth century the "Pardon" became a purely religious <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>.

<p>In the Diocese of Langres is Vassy, where in 1562 took place the riots between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> that gave rise to the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of religion (see <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">HUGUENOTS</a>). Numerous <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were held at Langres. The most important were those of 1404, 1421, 1621, 1628, 1679, 1725, 1733,1741,1783, and six successive annual <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> held by Mgr Parisis, from 1841 to 1846, with a view to the re-establishment of the synodal organization and also to impose on the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> the use of the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> (see GU&Eacute;RANGER). The principal <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> are: Our Lady of Montrol near Arc-en-Barrois (dating from the seventeenth century); Our Lady of the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">Hermits</a> at Cuves; Our Lady of Victories at Bourmont, <a href="../cathen/13356b.htm">St. Joseph</a>, Protector of the Souls in Purgatory, at Maranville. In 1908 there were still thirteen congregations of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in the diocese. The Sisters of Providence, founded in 1802, with their mother-house at Langres, were, at the time of the enforcement of the Associations Law, remarkable for the work they were doing in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. In 1901 the religious congregations had in the diocese 33 <em>&eacute;coles maternelles</em>, 1 agricultural <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> for boys, 6 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for girls, 7 workshops, 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of house-keeping, 2 dispensaries, 16 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, hospices, and homes for the aged, 2 houses of retreat, 113 houses for nursing of the sick at home. In 1908, three years after the separation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, the Diocese of Langres had 226,545 inhabitants, 28 canonical <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 416 ancillary <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 49 vicariates.
