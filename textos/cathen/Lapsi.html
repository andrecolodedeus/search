<h1>Lapsi</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, <em>labi, lapsus</em>).

<p>The regular designation in the third century for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who <em>relapsed</em> into <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a>, especially for those who during the persecutions displayed weakness in the face of torture, and denied the Faith by sacrificing to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> gods or by any other acts. Many of the lapsi, indeed the majority of the very numerous cases in the great persecutions after the middle of the third century, certainly did not return to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> out of conviction: they simply had not the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to confess the Faith steadfastly when threatened with temporal losses and severe punishments (banishments, forced labor [smudged in my version]... death), and their sole desire was to preserve themselves from <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> by an external act of apostasy, and to save their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, freedom, and life. The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of confessing the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> under all circumstances and avoiding every act of denial was firmly established in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from Apostolic times. The First Epistle of St. Peter exhorts the believers to remain steadfast under the visitations of affliction (i, 6, 7; iv, 16, 17). In his letter to <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, Pliny writes that those who are truly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> will not offer any <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> or utter any revilings against Christ. Nevertheless we learn both from "The Shepherd" of Hermas, and from the accounts of the persecutions and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a>, that individual <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> after the second century showed weakness, and fell away from the Faith. The aim of the civil proceedings against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, as laid down in <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan's</a> <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> to Pliny, was to lead them to apostasy. Those <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were acquitted who declared that they wished to be so no longer and performed acts of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> religious worship, but the steadfast were punished. In the "Martyrdom of St. Polycarp" (c. iv; ed. Funk, "Patres Apostolici", 2nd ed., I, 319), we read of a Prhygian, Quintus, who at first <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> avowed the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>, but showed weakness at the sight of wild beasts in the amphitheatre, and allowed the proconsul to persuade him to offer sacrifice. The letter of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, concerning the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there in 177, tells us likewise of ten brethren who showed weakness and <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a>. Kept, however, in confinement and stimulated by the example and the kind treatment they received from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who had remained steadfast, several of them repented their apostasy, and in a second trial, in which the renegades were to have been acquitted, they faithfully confessed Christ and gained the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs'</a> crown (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.2</a>).

<p>In general, it was a well-established principle in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the second and beginning of the third century that an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, even if he did penance, was not again taken into the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community, or admitted to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">Idolatry</a> was one of the three capital <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which entailed exclusion from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. After the middle of the third century, the question of the lapsi gave rise on several occasions to serious disputes in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities, and led to a further development of the penitential discipline in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The first occasion on which the question of the lapsi became a serious one in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and finally led to a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, was the great <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a> (250-1). An imperial edict, which frankly aimed at the extermination of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, enjoined that every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> must perform an act of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Whoever refused was threatened with the severest punishments. The officials were instructed to seek out the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and compel them to sacrifice, and to proceed against the recalcitrant ones with the greatest severity (see <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">DECIUS</a>). The consequences of this first general edict of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> were dreadful for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the long peace which the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> had enjoyed, many had become infected with a worldly spirit. A great number of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, and even some members of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, weakened, and, on the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the edict, flocked at once to the altars of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> idols to offer sacrifice. We are particularly well-informed about the events in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> and in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the correspondence of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and by his treatises, "De catholicae ecclesiae unitate" and <a href="../fathers/050703.htm">"De lapsis"</a> ("Caecilii Cypriani opera omnia", ed. Hartel I, II, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1868-71). There were various classes of lapsi, according to the act by which they fell: <ul><li><em>sacrificati</em>, those who had actually offered a sacrifice to the idols, <li><em>thuruficati</em>, those who had burnt <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> on the altar before the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of the gods; <li><em>libellatici</em>, those who had drawn up attestation (<em>libellus</em>), or had, by bribing the authorities, caused such certificates to be drawn up for them, representing them as having offered sacrifice, without, however, having actually done so.</ul> So far five of these libelli are known to us (one at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, one at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, two at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, one at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>; see Krebs in "Sitzungsberichte der kais. Akademie de Wissenschaften in Wein", 1894, pp. 3-9; Idem in "Patrologia Orientalis", IV, Paris, 1907, pp. 33 sq.; Franchi de' Cavalieri in "Nuovo Bulletino di archeologia cristiana", 1895, pp. 68-73). Some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were allowed to present a written declaration to the authorities to the effect that they had offered the prescribed <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to the gods, and asked for a certificate of this act (<em>libellum tradere</em>): this certificate was delivered by the authorities, and the petitioners received back the attestation (<em>libellum accipere</em>). Those who had actually sacrificed (the sacrificati and the thurificati) also received a certificate of having done so. The libellatici, in the narrow sense of the word, were those who obtained certificates without having actually sacrificed. Some of the libellatici, who forwarded to the authorities documents drawn up concerning their real or alleged <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and bearing their signatures, were also called <em>acta facientes</em>.



<p>The names of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who had shown their apostasy by one of the above-mentioned methods, were entered on the court records. After these weak brethren had received their attestations and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that their names were thus recorded, they felt themselves safe from further inquisition and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. The majority of the lapsi had indeed only obeyed the edict of <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a> out of weakness: at heart they wished to remain <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Feeling secure against further <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, they now wished to attend <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Christian worship</a> again and to be readmitted into the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but this desire was contrary to the then existing penitential discipline. The lapsi of Carthage succeeded in winning over to their side certain <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who had remained faithful, and had suffered torture and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. These confessors sent letters of recommendation in the name of the dead <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (<em>libella pacis</em>) to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in favor of the renegades. On the strength of these "letters of peace", the lapsi desired immediate admittance into communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and were actually admitted by some of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> inimically disposed to <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>. Similar difficulties arose at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian's</a> Carthaginian opponents sought for support in the capital in their attack against their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, who had remained in constant communication with the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> during the vacancy of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> after the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of Pope Fabian, decided that nothing should be done in the matter of reconciliation of the lapsi until the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> should be over and he could return to Carthage. Only those <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> who showed that they were penitent, and had received a personal note (libellus pacis) from a confessor or a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, might obtain <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> and admission to communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, if they were dangerously ill and at the point of death. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, likewise, the principle was established that the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> should not be given up, but that they should be exhorted to do penance, so that, in case of their being again cited before the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> authorities, they might atone for their apostasy by steadfastly confessing the Faith. Furthermore, communion was not to be refused to those who were seriously ill, and wished to atone for their apostasy by penance.

<p>The party opposed to <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> at Carthage did not accept the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> decision, and stirred up a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. When, after the election of <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">St. Cornelius</a> to the Chair of Peter, the Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> set himself up at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, he claimed to be the upholder of strict discipline, inasmuch as he refused unconditionally to readmit to communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> any who had fallen away. He was the founder of <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatianism</a>. Shortly after <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian's</a> return to his episcopal city in the Spring of 251, <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were held in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Africa, at which the affair of the lapsi was adjusted by common agreement. It was adopted as a principle that they should be encouraged to repent, and, under certain conditions and after adequate public penance (<em>exomologesis</em>), should be readmitted to communion. In fixing the duration of the penance, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were to take under consideration the circumstances of the apostasy, e.g., whether the penitent had offered sacrifice at once or only after torture, whether he had led his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> into apostasy or on the other hand had saved them therefrom, after obtaining for himself a certificate of having sacrificed. Those, who of their own accord had actually sacrificed (the sacrificati or thurificati), might be reconciled with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> only at the point of death. The libellatici might, after a reasonable penance, be immediately readmitted. In view of the severe <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> then imminent, it was decided at a subsequent Carthaginian synod that all lapsi who had undergone public penance should be readmitted to full communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Bishop <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a> adopted the same attitude towards the lapsi as <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Pope Cornelius</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> and the African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. But in the East Novatian's rigid views at first found a more sympathetic reception. The united efforts of the supporters of <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Pope Cornelius</a> succeeded in bringing the great majority of the Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to recognize him as the rightful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>, with which recognition the acceptance of the principles relative to the case of the lapsi was naturally united. A few groups of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in different parts of the empire shared the views of <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, and this enabled the latter to form a small <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> community (see <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">NOVATIANISM</a>).

<p>At the time of the great <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, matters took the same course as under <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>. During this severe affliction which assailed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, many showed weakness and fell away, and, as before, performed acts of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> worship, or tried by artifice to evade <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Some, with the collusion of the officials, sent their slaves to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> instead of going themselves; others bribed <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> to assume their names and to performed the required <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> (Petrus Alexandrinus, "Liber de poenitentia" in Routh, "Reliquiae Sacr.", IV, 2nd ed., 22 sqq). In the <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> appeared a new category of lapsi called the <em>traditores</em>: these were the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (mostly <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>) who, in obedience to an edict, gave up the sacred books to the authorities. The term <em>traditores</em> was given both to those who actually gave up the sacred books, and to those who merely delivered secular works in their stead. As on the previous occasion the lapsi in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, under the leadership of a certain Hericlius, tried forcibly to obtain readmission to communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without performing penance, but Popes Marcellus and <a href="../cathen/05615b.htm">Eusebius</a> adhered strictly to the traditional penitential discipline. The confusion and disputes caused by this difference among the Roman <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> caused <a href="../cathen/10073b.htm">Maxentius</a> to banish Marcellus and later <a href="../cathen/05615b.htm">Eusebius</a> and Heraclius (cf. Inscriptions of Pope Damasus on Popes Marcellus and Eusebius in Ihm, "Damasi epigrammata", Leipzig, 1895, p. 51, n. 48; p. 25, n. 18). In Africa the unhappy <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> arose from disputes about the lapsi, especially the traditores (see <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">DONATISTS</a>). Several <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of the fourth century drew up canons on the treatment of the lapsi, e.g., the Synod of Elvira in 306 (can. i-iv, xlvi), or Arles in 314 (can. xiii), of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> in 314 (can. i-ix), and the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">General Council of Nice</a> (can. xiii). Many of the decisions of these <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> concerned only members of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who had committed acts of apostasy in time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>.
