<h1>Laurentius Surius</h1>  

<p>Hagiologist, born at the Hanseatic city of L&uuml;beck, 1522; died at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, 23 May, 1578. It is not certain whether his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> or <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>. According to a remark made by Peter Canisius ("Epistol&aelig;", ed. Braunsberger, I, 36), he was born a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> and was brought into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by Canisius. Surius studied at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of Frankfort-on-the-Oder and Cologne. In the latter <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> Peter Canisius was a fellow-student. Surius also met there Johannes Justus Lansperger, who induced him to enter the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, in 1542. The greater part of his life after this was spent in his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, where he was a model of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, of rigid observance of the rules of the order, and of earnest work as a scholar; for these reasons he was held in high esteem by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a>. He devoted himself chiefly to the domains of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> and <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiography</a>, and wrote a large number of works on these subjects. He also translated into Latin many works, mainly ascetical and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>. Among these translations should be mentioned writings by <a href="../cathen/14465c.htm">Tauler</a>, Heinrich Seuse, <a href="../cathen/13280c.htm">Ruysbroeck</a>, <a href="../cathen/07036b.htm">Gropper's</a> work on the reality of <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Christ's Flesh and Blood</a>, the sermons of Michael Sidonius, the apologies of Friedrich Staphylus, and an oration by Martin Eisengrein. He completed the "Institutiones" of Florentius of <a href="../cathen/07095a.htm">Haarlem</a>, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and edited a new edition of the "Homiliarium" of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. He wrote against Sleidanus his "Commentarius brevis rerum in orbe gestarum ab a. 1500 ad a. 1564" (Cologne, 1566), which was continued by others. He was also the author of a collection of the Acts of the councils: "Concilia omnia tum generalia tum provincialia" (4 vols., Cologne, 1567).

<p>His most important and still valuable work is his collection of the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, "De probatis Sanctorum historiis ab Al. Lipomano olim conscriptis nunc primum a Laur. Surio emendatis et auctis", the first edition of which appeared in six volumes at Cologne in 1570-77. He began a second edition which was finished after his death by his colleague in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, Mosander, who added a seventh volume (Cologne, 1582). A third edition with an improved text appeared at Cologne in 1618; a new and revised edition was published (1875-80) at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> in thirteen volumes. Notwithstanding the liberties taken by Surius with the text of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> he used, his work has rendered great service and has furnished many narratives concerning the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> that have been published in various languages.
