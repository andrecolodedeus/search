<h3>Diocese of Lausanne and Geneva (Lausannensis et Genevensis)</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Lausanne</h2>

<p>According to the most recent investigations, particularly those of Marius Besson, the origin of the See of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a> can be traced to the ancient See of Windisch (Vindonissa). Bubulcus, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Windisch, appeared at the imperial Synod of Epao in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, in 517 (<a href="../cathen/09479a.htm">Maassen</a>, "Concilia &aelig;vi merov." in "Mon. Germ. Hist.: Leg.", III, I, <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, 1893, 15-30). The second and last known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Windisch was Gramatius (Grammatius), who signed the decrees of the Synod of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> in 535 (<a href="../cathen/09479a.htm">Maassen</a>, 1. c., pp. 65-71) of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, 541 (<a href="../cathen/09479a.htm">Maassen</a>, 1. c., 86-99), and that of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, 549 (<a href="../cathen/09479a.htm">Maassen</a> 1. c., 99-112). Hitherto it has generally been believed that shortly after this the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was transferred from Windisch to <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>. Besson has made it probable that, between 549 and 585, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was divided and the real seat of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Windisch transferred to Avenches (Aventicum), while the eastern part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was united with <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>. According to the Synod of <a href="../cathen/09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a>, 585 (<a href="../cathen/09479a.htm">Maassen</a>, 1. c., 163-73), St. Marius seems to have been the first resident <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Avenches. The <a href="../cathen/03637a.htm">Chartularium</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a> (ed. G. Waitz in "Mon. Germ.: Scriptores", XXIV, <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, 1879, 794; also in "M&eacute;moires et documents pull, par la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de la Suisse Romande", VI, <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a>, 1851, 29) affirms that St. Marius was born in the <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Diocese of Autun</a> about 530, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Avenches in May, 574, and died 31 December, 594. (For his epitaph in verse, formerly in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Thyrsius at Lausanne, see "Mon. Germ.: Script.", XXIV, 795.) To him we are indebted for a valuable addition (455-581) to the Chronicle of <a href="../cathen/12487a.htm">St. Prosper of Aquitaine</a> (P.L. LXXII, 793-802; also in "Mon. Germ.: Auctores Antiquissimi", XI, <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1894,232-39). The See of Avenches may have been transferred to Lausanne by Marius, or possibly not before 610.

<p>Lausanne was originally a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> (certainly about the seventh century), later of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>, from which it was detached by the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">French Concordat of 1801</a>. In <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> the diocese extended from the Aar, near Soleure, to the northern end of the Valley of St. Imier, thence along the Doubs and the ridge of the Jura to where the Aubonne flows into the Lake of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, and thence along the north of the lake to Villeneuve whence the boundary-line followed the watershed between Rh&ocirc;ne and Aar to the Grimsel, and down the Aar to Attiswil. Thus the diocese included the town of Soleure and part of its territory that part of the Canton of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> which lay on the left bank of the River Aar, also Biel, the Valley of St. Imier, Jougne, and Les Longevilles in the Franche-Comt&eacute;, the counties of Neuch&acirc;tel and Valangin, the greater part of the Canton de Vaud, the Canton of Fribourg, the county of Gruy&egrave;re, and most of the Bernese Oberland. The present Diocese of Lausanne includes the Cantons of Fribourg, Vaud, and Neuch&acirc;tel.

<p>Of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who in the seventh century succeeded St. Marius almost nothing is known. Between 594 and 800 only three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are known: Arricus, present at the Council of Chalon-sur-Sa&ocirc;ne (<a href="../cathen/09479a.htm">Maassen</a>, 1. c., 208-14), Protasius, elected about 651, and Chilmegisilus, about 670. From the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> until the end of the ninth century the following <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a> are mentioned: Udalricus (Ulrich), a contemporary of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>; Fredarius (about 814); David (827-50), slain in combat with one of the lords of Degerfelden; Hartmann (851-78); Hieronymus (879-92). The most distinguished among the subsequent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are: Heinrich von Lenzburg (d. 1019), who rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in 1000; Hugo (1019-37), a son of Rudolf III of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, in 1037 proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/15068a.htm">"Peace of God"</a>; Burkart von Oltingen (1057-89), one of the most devoted adherents of Henry IV, with whom he was banished, and made the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Canossa; Guido von Merlen (1130-44), a correspondent of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a>; St. Amadeus of Hauterive, a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> (1144-59), who wrote <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> (P.L., CLXXXVIII, 1277-1348); Boniface, much <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> (1231-39), formerly a master in the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> and head of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, resigned because of physical ill-treatment, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> in Brabant (see <a href="../cathen/12660a.htm">Ratzinger</a> in "Stimmen aus Maria-Laach", L, 1896, 10-23, 139-57); the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Louis de la Palud (1432-40), who took part in the Councils of <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> (1414), Pavia-Siena (1423), Basle (1431--) and at the last-named was chosen, in January, 1432, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a>, against Jean de Prangins, the chapter's choice; Palud was later vice-chamberlain of the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> whence Amadeus VIII of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> emerged as the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="../cathen/06031b.htm">Felix V</a>, by whom he was made a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; George of <a href="../cathen/13405c.htm">Saluzzo</a>, who published synodical constitutions for the reform of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere (1472-76), who in 1503 ascended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne as <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>.

<p>Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a>, who had been Counts of Vaud since the time of Rudolf III of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> (1011), and until 1218 subject only to imperial authority, were in 1270 made princes of the Holy Roman Empire, but their temporal power only extended over a small part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, namely over the city and district of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a>, as well as a few towns and villages in the Cantons of Vaud and Fribourg; on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> possessed many feoffees among the most distinguished of the patrician <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of Western <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. The guardians of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> (<em>advocati, avou&eacute;s</em>) of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were originally the counts of Genevois, then the lords of Gerenstein, the dukes of Z&auml;hringin, the of Kyburg, lastly, the counts (later dukes) of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. These guardians, whose only <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> originally was the protection of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, enlarged their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> at the expense of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and even filled the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> with members of their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. Wearisome quarrels resulted, during which the city of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a>, with the aid of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> and Fribourg, acquired new <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, and gradually freed itself from episcopal suzerainty. When Bishop Sebastian de Montfaucon (1517-60) took sides with the Duke of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> in a battle against Berne, the Bernese used this as a pretext to seize the city of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a>. On 31 March, 1536, Hans Franz N&auml;geli entered Lausanne as conqueror, abolished <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and began a religious revolution. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to fly, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> treasure was taken to <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter was dissolved (and never re-established), while the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was given over to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. Bishop Sebastian died an exile in 1560, and his three successors were likewise exiles. It was only in 1610, under Bishop Johann VII of Watteville, that the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was provisionally re-established at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>, where it has since remained. The Cantons of Vaud, Neuch&acirc;tel, and Berne, were entirely lost to the See of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. By the French Constitution Civile du Clerg&eacute; (1790) the Parishes of the French Jura fell to the <a href="../cathen/02415a.htm">Diocese of Belley</a>, and this was confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a>. In 1814 the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Soleure, in 1828 those of the Bernese Jura, and in 1864 also that district of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> on the left bank of the Aar were attached to the See of Basle. In compensation, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> assigned, in a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> brief of 20 September, 1819, the city of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> and twenty <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> belonging to the old Diocese of Geneva (which in 1815 had become <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a>) to the See of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (in 1815 Petrus Tohias Yenni) retained his residence at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>, and since 1821 has borne the title and arms of the Bishops of Lausanne and Geneva. His <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar general</a> resides at Geneva, and is always <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of that city.


<h2 id="section2">Geneva</h2>

<p>Geneva (Genava of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, also Janua and Genua), capital of the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> canton of the same name situated where the Rh&ocirc;ne issues from the Lake of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> (<em>Lacus Lemanus</em>), first appears in history as a border town, fortified against the Helvetians, which the Romans took in 120 B.C. In A.D. 443 it was taken by <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, and with the latter fell to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> in 534. In 888 the town was part of the new Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, and with it was taken over in 1033 by the German Emperor. According to legendary accounts found in the works of Gregorio Leti ("Historia Genevrena", Amsterdam, 1686) and Besson ("M&eacute;moires pour l'histoire eccl&eacute;siastique des dioc&egrave;ses de Gen&egrave;ve, Tantaise, Aoste et Maurienne", <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>, 1739; new ed. Moutiers, 1871), Geneva was Christianised by Dionysius Areopagita and Paracodus, two of the seventy-two disciples, in the time of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>; Dionysius went thence to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and Paracodus became the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>. The legend, however, is fictitious, as is that which makes St. Lazarus the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> arising out of the similarity between the Latin names <em>Genara</em> (Geneva) and <em>Genua</em> (Genoa, in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>). The so-called "Catalogue de St. Pierre", which gives St. Diogenus (Diogenes) as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, is untrustworthy. A letter of <a href="../cathen/05595a.htm">St. Eucherius</a> to Salvius makes it almost certain that St. Isaac (c. 400) was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In 440 St. Salonius appears as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>; he was a son of <a href="../cathen/05595a.htm">St. Eucherius</a>, to whom the latter dedicated his Instructiones'; he took part. in the Councils of Orange (441), Vaison (442), and Arles (about 455), and is supposed to be the author of two small commentaries, "In parabolas Salomonis", and on Ecclesisastis (published in P.L., LII, 967 sqq., 993 sqq. as works of an otherwise unknown <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Salonius of Vienne). Little is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> about the following Bishops Theoplastus (about 475), to whom St. Sidonius Apollinaris addressed a letter; Dormitianus (before 500), under whom the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> Princess Sedeleuba, a sister of Queen Clotilda, had the remains of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and St. Victor of Soleure transferred to Geneva, where she built a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; St.. Maximus (about 512-41), a friend of Avitus, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Vienne and <a href="../cathen/04582b.htm">Cyprian of Toulon</a>, with whom he was in correspondence (Wawra in "Tubinger Theolog. Quartalschrift", LXXXV, 1905, 576-594). Bishop Pappulus sent the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Thoribiusas his substitute to the Synod of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> (541). Bishop Salonius II is only known from the signatures of the Synods of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> (570) and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (573), and Bishop Cariatto, installed by King Guntram in 584, was present at the two Synods of <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a> and M&acirc;con in 585.

<p>From the beginning the See of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> was a suffragan of Vienne. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> had been princes of the Holy Roman Empire since 1154, but, had to maintain a long struggle for their independence against the guardians (<em>advocari</em>) of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, the counts of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> and, later, the counts of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. In 1290 the latter obtained the right of installing the <em>vice-dominus</em> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> &#151; the official who exercised minor <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the town in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> name. In 1387 Bishop Adh&eacute;mar Fabry granted the town its great charter, the basis of its communal self-government, which every <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on his accession was expected to confirm. When the line of the count of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> became extinct, in 1394, and the House of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> came into possession of their territory, assuming, after 1416, the title of Duke, the new dynasty sought by every means to bring the city of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> under their power, particularly by elevating members of their own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. The city protected itself by union with the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Federation (<em>Eidgenossenschaft</em>), uniting itself, in 1526, with Berne and Fribourg. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> plunged Geneva into new entanglements: while Berne favoured the introduction of the new teaching, and demanded liberty of preaching for the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> Farel and Froment, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Fibourg, in 1511, renounced its allegiance with Geneva. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> went to Geneva in 1536 and began systematically to preach his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> there. By his theocratic "Reign of Terror" he succeeded in forcing himself upon Geneva as absolute ruler, and converted the city into a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as early as 1532 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had been <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave his residence, never to return; in 1536 he fixed his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at Gex, in 1535 at <a href="../cathen/01540a.htm">Annecy</a>. The Apostolic <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and devotion of <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> from 1602 to 1621, restored to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> a large part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.

<p>Formerly the Diocese of Geneva extended well into <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, as far as Mont Cenis and the Great St. Bernard. Nyon, also, often <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> considered a separate diocese, belonged to Geneva. "Under <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> Taraittaise was detached from Geneva and became a separate diocese. Before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the See of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> ruled over 8 chapters, 423 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 9 <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, and 68 <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a>. In 1802 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was united with that of <a href="../cathen/03566c.htm">Chamb&eacute;ry</a>. At the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> the territory of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> was extended to cover 15 <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoyard</a> and 6 <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with more than 16,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; at the same time it was admitted to the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Federation. The Congress expressly provided &#151; and the same proviso was included in the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> (16 March, 1816) &#151; that in these territories transferred to Geneva the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion was to be protected, and that no changes were to be made in existing conditions without agreement with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> next (1819) united the city of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> and 20 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with the Diocese of Lausanne, while the rest of the ancient Diocese of Geneva (outside of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>) was reconstituted, in 1822, as the <a href="../cathen/01540a.htm">Diocese of Annecy</a>. The Great Council of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> (cantonal council) afterwards ignored the responsibilities thus undertaken; in imitation of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> <a href="../cathen/01756a.htm">"Organic Articles"</a>, it insisted upon the "Placet", or previous approval of publication, for all <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> indignation ran high at the civil measures taken against Marilley, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, and later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Still greater indignation was aroused among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> created by the <em>Kulturkanmpf</em>, which <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> them to contribute to the budget of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant Church</a> and to that of the <a href="../cathen/11235b.htm">Old Catholic Church</a>, while for their own religious needs they did not receive the smallest pecuniary aid from the public treasury. On 30 June, 1907, most of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> voted for the separation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. By this act of separation they were assured at least a negative equality with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a>. Since then the Canton of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> has given aid to no creed out of either the state or the municipal revenues. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, however, have been favoured, for to them a lump compensation of 800,000 francs (about $160,000) was paid at the outset, whereas the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, in spite of the international agreements assuring financial support to their religion &#151; either from the public funds or from other sources &#151; received nothing.
<h2 id="section3">Lausanne and Geneva</h2>

<p>Bishop Yenni's (d. 8 December, 1845) successor was Etienne Marilley. Deposed, in 1848, by the Cantons of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>, <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, Vaud, and Neuch&acirc;tel, owing to serious differences with the Radical regime at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>, he was kept a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> for fifty days in the castle of Chillom, on the Lake of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, and then spent. eight years in exile at Divonne (<a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>); he was allowed to return to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> 19 December, 1856. In 1864 <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> appointed the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, Gaspard Mermillod, <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>, and in 1873 Vicar Apostolic, of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, thus detaching the Genevese territory from the diocese and making it a vicariate. This new Apostolic vicariate was, however, not recognized by either the State Council of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> or the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Federal Council, and Mermillod was banished from <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 17 February, 1873. When the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> condemned this measure, the Government answered on 12 December, 1873, by expelling the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a>. After Bishop Marilley had resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (1879) Monsignor Cossandey, <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>, was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lausanne and Geneva, and after his death, Mermillod. Thus the Apostolic Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> was given up, the conflict with the Government ended, and the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of expulsion against Mermillod was revoked. When, in 1890, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> made Mermillod a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, he removed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> then appointed the present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Monsignor Joseph Deruaz, and he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 19 March, 1890, by his predecessor. Mgr. Deruaz was born 13 May, 1826, at Choulex in the Canton of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a> and he was vicar at Grand Sacconex near <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, and then cur&eacute; at Rolle, in the Canton of Vaud, and at Lausanne. Hew was present at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> with Bishop Marilley. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he worked in the spirit of conciliation, and was successful in remedying the ills of the <em>Kulturkamf</em> in the Canton of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>.
<h3>Statistics</h3>

<p>The present Diocese of Lausanne-Geneva comprises the Cantons of Fribourg, <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, Vaul, and Neuch&acirc;tel, with the exception of certain <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the right bank of the Rh&ocirc;ne belonging to the Dioecse of Sion (Sitten). According to B&uuml;chi (see bibliography) and the "Dictionnaire g&eacute;ographique de la Suisse" (Neuch&acirc;tel, 1905), III, 49 sqq., the diocese numbers approximately 434,049 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and 232,056 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; consequently, the latter form somewhat more than one-third of the whole population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> inhabit principally the Canton of Fribourg (excepting the Lake District) and the country <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> transferred to Geneva in 1515, four communes in the Canton of Neuch&acirc;tel, and ten in the Canton of Vaud. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population in the Cantons of Fribourg and Geneva consists principally of farmers, in both of the other cantons it is also recruited from the labouring classes. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are distributed among 193 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, of which 162 are allotted to Lausanne, 31 to Geneva. The number of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> is 390, those belonging to orders 70. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and congregations are almost entirely in the Canton of Fribourg. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> have <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a> and Bulle, and hospices at Romont and Landeron; since 1861, the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> have been in possession of their old convent of Val-Sainte, suppressed in the 2eighteenth century. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> conduct the German classes in the Fribourg Gymnasium. The <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a> and the Congregation of the Divine Saviour (Societas Divini Salvatoris) have establishments at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> congregations represented in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> at Maigrauge, near <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>, and Fille-Dieu near Romont; <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at Estavayer; Sisters of Charity (Hospital Sisters) at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>, Estavayer, and Neuch&acirc;tel, (Theodosia's of the Holy Cross) at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>, Ueberstorf, <a href="../cathen/15682b.htm">St. Wolfgang</a> and Neuch&acirc;tel, (of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>) at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>, Chatel-St-Denis, Billens, and Tafers; Capucines at Montorge, near Fribourg. The Visitandines and the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> conduct each a girls' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>; the Teaching <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a>, of Menzingen and Ingenbohl, conduct several <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls (among them the Academy of the Holy Cross at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a> attached to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>); they are also employed as teachers in many of the village <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The Filles de L'Ouvre de St. Paul (not properly religious) have, among other works, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> bookstore at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>, and a well-arranged printing house. Among the more important. <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> of diocese, besides those already mentioned, are: the <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">University of Fribourg</a> [see Fribourg (Switzerland). University of]; the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St. Charles at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>, with seven <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> professors; the cantonal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of St. Michel, also at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>, which comprises a German and French gymnasium, a <em>Realschule</em> (corresponding somewhat to the English first-grade <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>) and commercial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, as well as a lyceum, the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of which is a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>. This <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> has at present (1910) about 800 pupils, with 40 <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and as many lay professors. Three other cantonal <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> exist in the diocese: Geneva (founded by <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> in 1559, and in 1873 raised to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> with five faculties); Neuch&acirc;tel (1866, academy; 1909, <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>); Lausanne (1537, academy; <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> since 1890, with five faculties). Geneva and Lausanne both have cantonal <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculties, Neuch&acirc;tel a "Facult&eacute; de th&eacute;ologie de l'&eacute;glise ind&eacute;pendante de l'&eacute;tat". For the government of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> there are, besides the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, two vicars-general, one of whom lives at Geneva, the other at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>. There are, moreover, a <em>provicarius generalis</em>, who is also chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and a secretary. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a> (with 32 canons was suppressed at the time of the reformation, and has never been re-established, in consequence of which the choice of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> rests with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In 1512 <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> established a collegiate chapter in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Nicholas at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, with a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> appointed by the Great Council, also a dean, a cantor, and ten <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a>. This collegiate church takes the place of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, still lacking, since the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Pierre at Geneva and that of Notre-Dame at Lausanne were given over to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> at the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>.
