<h1>Lavabo</h1>  

<p>The first word of that portion of Psalm 25 said by the celebrant at Mass while he washes his hands after the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>, from which word the whole <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> is named.

<p>The principle of washing the hands before celebrating the holy Liturgy &#151; at first an obvious practical precaution of cleanness, then interpreted also symbolically &#151; occurs naturally in all rites. In the Eastern rites this is done at the beginning as part of the vesting; it is generally accompanied by the same fragment of Psalm 25 (vv. 6-12) said in the West after the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>. But in the "Apost. Const.", VIII, 11, the hands of the celebrants are washed just before the dismissal of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> (Brightman, 13), in the Syriac and Coptic rites after the creed (ib., 82 and 162). <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">Cyril of Jerusalem</a> also mentions a washing that takes place in sight of the people (Cat. Myst., v). So also in the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> the celebrant washes his hands before vesting, but with another <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> ("Da, Domine, virtutem", etc., in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> among the "Orationes ante Missam"). The reason of the second washing, during the Mass, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was no doubt the special need for it after the long <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of receiving the loaves and vessels of wine from the people at the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> (all of which is absent from the Eastern rites). The first Roman Ordines describe a general washing of hands by the celebrant and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, who have received and carried the offerings to the altar, immediately after they have done so ("Ordo Rom. I", 14; "Ordo of St. Amand" in Duchesne, "Origines du Culte", 443, etc.; in the St. Amand Ordo the Pontiff washes his hands both before and after the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>). There is as yet no mention of any psalm or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> said at the time. In the <a href="../cathen/06357a.htm">Gallican Rite</a> the offerings were prepared before Mass began, as in the East; so there was no <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> nor place for a Lavabo later. At <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> there is now an <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> borrowed from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but no washing of hands at this point; the Mozarabic Liturgy also has a Romanizing <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> and a washing, but without any <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (Missale Mixtum", P.L., LXXXV, 538). The <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> had in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> two washings of the hands at the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>, one just before, while the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> spread the corporal on the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, one immediately after the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensing</a> that follows the offertory (Durandus, "Rationale", IV, 28; <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, "De SS. Miss&aelig; Sacrif.", II, 11). The first of these has now disappeared. The second was accompanied by the verses 6-12 of Psalm xxv. This psalm is first mentioned by the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> commentators (e.g. Durandus, loc. cit.). No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> it was said from very early times as a private devotion obviously suitable for the occasion. We have noted that it accompanies the washing before the Liturgy in the Byzantine Rite. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> notes that as late as his time (eighteenth century) "in some churches only some verses are said" (loc. cit.) although the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> requires that all (that is from v. 6 to the end) be recited. <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">Cyril of Jerusalem</a> (loc. cit.) already explains the washing as a symbol of purity of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; all the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> writers (Durandus, loc. cit.; St <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a>, "Summa Theol.", III, Q. lxxxiii, art. 5, ad 1um; etc.) insist on this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>.

<p>The present rule is this: At high Mass (or sung Mass), as soon as the celebrant has <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a> the altar after the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> and has been <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a> himself at the Epistle side, he remains there while his hands are washed by the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>, who must be waiting by the credence-table. The first <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a> pours water from the <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruet</a> over his fingers into the little dish provided, the second then hands him the towel to dry the fingers. Meanwhile he says: <a href="../bible/psa025.htm">"Lavabo inter innocentes"</a>, etc., to the end of the psalm, with "Gloria Patri" and "Sicut erat". The Gloria is left out in Masses for the dead and in Masses <em>de tempore</em> from <a href="../cathen/11535a.htm">Passion Sunday</a> to <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> exclusively ("Ritus celebrandi", VII, 6, in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>). A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at high Mass wears the "precious" <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> (<em>mitra pretiosa</em>) while he is <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a> and washes his hands (C&aelig;rim. Episc., II, 8, 64); in this case a larger silver jug and <a href="../cathen/02334a.htm">basin</a> are generally used, though the C&aelig;rimoniale Episcoporum" does not mention them. At low <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, since there is no <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, the celebrant goes to the Epistle side and washes his hands in the same way immediately after the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> "Veni sanctificator". For his convenience the altar-card on the Epistle side contains the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> said when the water is blessed before it is put into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> ("Deus qui human&aelig; substanti&aelig;") and the verses <a href="../bible/psa025.htm">"Lavabo"</a>, etc.
