<h1>Lavant</h1>  

<p>(LAVANTINA)

<p>An Austrian <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in the southern part of <a href="../cathen/14318a.htm">Styria</a>, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>. The original seat of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> lay in the eastern part of Carinthia in the valley of the Lavant. It was here that Eberhard II, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, established, 20 Aug., 1212, at St. Andr&auml;, with the consent of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> and <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a>, a collegiate chapter, the canons of which followed the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>; its members were chosen from the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>. On account of the great remoteness and the difficulty of travelling, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, about the year 1223, asked Pope <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> to allow him to found a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> at St. Andr&auml;. After the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had had the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> request examined by commissioners, and had given his consent, Eberhard drew up the deed of foundation, 10 May, 1228, wherein he secured the possession of the episcopal chair for himself and his successors in perpetuity. He named as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> his court <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> Ulrich, who had formerly been <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Haus, in Styria (died 1257).

<p>In the deed of foundation of the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, no boundaries were defined. In a deed of Archbishop <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> of 1280, seventeen <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, situated partly in Carinthia and partly in <a href="../cathen/14318a.htm">Styria</a>, were described as belonging to Lavant; the extent of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was rather small, but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> also attended to the office of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> for some scattered districts; they also frequently attended to the office of <em>Vicedom</em> (<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> deputy in secular affairs) at Friesach. The tenth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Dietrich Wolfhauer (1318-32), is mentioned in deeds as the first prince-bishop; he was also secretary of Frederick III the Handsome, of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and was present at the battle of M&uuml;hldorf in 1322. Since the twenty-second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Theobald Schweinbeck (1446-63), the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have borne without intermission the title of prince. The following prominent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> deserve special mention: the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> Johann I von Rott (1468-82), died as Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>; Georg II Agrikola (1570-84), who after 1572 was also at the same time <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13672a.htm">Seckau</a>; Georg III Stob&auml;us von Palmburg (1584-1618), a worthy promotor of the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>; Maximilian Gandolph Freiherr von Kienburg (1654-65), did much towards increasing the financial resources of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.

<p>By the new regulations under <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a>, several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> were added to the Diocese of Lavant. Prince-Archbishop Michael Brigido of <a href="../cathen/08743a.htm">Laibach</a> in 1788 ceded a number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the southern part of what is now the Diocese of Lavant; and the district of V&ouml;lkermarkt, which was afterwards again detached, was added to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> at that time. The present extent of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was brought about by the circumscription of 1 June, 1859. The valley of the Lavant and the district of V&ouml;lkermarkt in Carinthia fell to Gurk; in consequence of which the District of Marburg was transferred from <a href="../cathen/13672a.htm">Seckau</a> to Lavant; since then the diocese comprises the whole of southern Styria. By the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Congregation of the Consistory of 20 May, 1857, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was removed from St. Andr&auml; to Marburg; the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of St. John the Baptist in that place being erected into a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and the title "of Lavant" being preserved. On 4 Sept, 1859, <a href="../cathen/14057a.htm">Bishop Anton Martin Slomschek</a> (1846-62) made his solemn entry into Marburg. His successors, Jakob Maximilian Stepischnegg (1862-89), and Michael Napotnik (since 1889) have shown great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the promotion of the spiritual life by introducing <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and founding <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> and clubs. But the most beneficial work done for the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was that of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, held by Stepischnegg (1883), and by Napotnik, who followed his example (1896, 1900, 1903, and 1906).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> is divided into 24 deaneries, and numbered (1909) 223 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 200 chaplaincies (48 unoccupied), 7 unoccupied offices and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, 375 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> engaged in the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>, 39 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and 53 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in other positions, 37 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> without office, 675 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and 521,896 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, which is four-fifths Slovene and one-fifth German, consists of one mitred <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, one mitred <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> dean, and five canons. The old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, which was composed of the canons of the Augustinian order, was dissolved in 1808, and its <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was assigned to the "Religionsfond" founded by <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>; in 1825 a new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter was provisionally erected, and definitively so in 1847. Besides the actual canons, there are six stalls for honorary canons (four temporarily vacant). The council is composed of six advisors; the prince-bishop is the president. In the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> college there are eleven lecturers; the episcopal priests' <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> numbers (1909) 4 classes, with 42 students; the "Maximilianum-Viktorinum", an episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys, 8 classes, with 80 students. Eight <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> teachers taught in 7 state <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.

<p>In the diocese there are the following establishments of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders: 1 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a> of Sts. Peter and Paul, at Pettau (founded 1239), with nine fathers; 4 <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, with 31 fathers, 23 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, and 5 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>; 1 <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Cilli (founded 1611), with 6 fathers, and 4 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>; 2 mission houses of the Fathers of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, with 8 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 10 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>; 1 <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappist</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, Maria Erl&ouml;sung, at Reichenburg (founded 1881 by French <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>), with 21 fathers, and 48 brothers. Orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: <a href="../cathen/03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a>, 82, in 6 establishments, who are dedicated to the nursing of the sick; School Sisters of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, 1 motherhouse, 14 affiliated houses, 190 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; School Sisters from the mother-house of Algersdorf, Graz, 9, with 1 institution 1 <a href="../cathen/09524a.htm">magdalen</a> asylum, with 17 canonesses, and 15 lay sisters; <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> of the Holy Cross, 3, with one establishment; Sisters of the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a>, 9, with one <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>; 1 <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Convent of Perpetual Adoration (10 sisters).

There are 36 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> clubs and confraternities in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, besides 25 associations for the building and adornment of churches.

<p>The most prominent <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> buildings in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of St. John the Baptist, at Marburg, which was begun in the middle of the twelfth century as a Romanesque basilica, rebuilt after 1520 in the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style, again restored after the fire in 1601, and once more in 1885; the provostship and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of St. Georg, at Pettau, erected in the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style about 1314; the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Daniel, at Cilli, dates from the middle of the sixteenth century; and the shrine of St. Maria der W&uuml;ste, in the neighbourhood of Marburg (built 1628), in the <a href="../cathen/02303b.htm">baroque style</a>.
