<h1>Lay Abbot</h1>  

<p>(<em>abbatocomes, abbas laicus, abbas miles</em>).

<p>A name used to designate a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> on whom a king or someone in authority bestowed an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> as a reward for services rendered; he had charge of the estate belonging to it, and was entitled to part of the income. This baneful custom had a bad effect upon the life of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. It existed principally in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire from the eighth century till the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms of the eleventh. <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a> was the first to bestow extensive <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> upon <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, political friends, and warriors who had helped him in his campaigns. At an earlier period the French Merovingians had bestowed church lands on <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, or at least allowed them their possession and use, though not ownership. Numerous <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> held in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the sixth and seventh centuries passed decrees against this abuse of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. The French kings were also in the habit of appointing <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which they had founded; moreover, many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, though not founded by the king, placed themselves under royal patronage in order to share his protection, and so became possessions of the Crown. This custom of the Merovingian rulers of disposing of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> in individual cases, as also that of appointing <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> founded by or belonging to themselves, was taken as a precedent by the French kings for rewarding <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> with <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, or giving them to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em>. Under <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was greatly injured by this abuse, not only in her possessions, but also in her <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> and later <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar of Reims</a> picture most dismally the consequent downfall of church discipline, and though <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> tried <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> and even successfully to reform the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Church, the bestowal of <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> on secular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> was not entirely abolished. Under Pepin the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were permitted, in case their <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> should fall into secular hands, to go over to an other community.

<p><a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> also frequently gave <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, and sometimes <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> tenure. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that Louis the Pious aided <a href="../cathen/02467a.htm">St. Benedict of Aniane</a> in his endeavours to reform the monastic life. In order to accomplish this it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to restore the free election of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and the appointment as well of blameless <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> as heads of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">monastic houses</a>. Although Emperor Louis shared these principles, he continued to bestow <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> on <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, and his sons imitated him. The important Abbey of St. Riquier (Centula) in Picardy had secular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> from the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, who had given it to his friend Angilbert, the poet and the lover of his daughter <a href="../cathen/02519a.htm">Bertha</a>, and father of her two sons (see <a href="../cathen/01490b.htm">SAINT ANGILBERT</a>). After Angilbert's death in 814, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was given to other <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. Under such influences the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was bound to suffer; frequently the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> were scenes of worldliness and revelry. Various <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of the ninth century passed decrees against this custom; the Synod of Diedenhofen (October, 844) decreed in its third canon, that <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> should no longer remain in the power of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, but that <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> should be their <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, "Konziliengeschichte", 2nd ed., IV, 110). In like manner the Synods of Meaux and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (845-846) complained that the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> held by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> had fallen into decay, and emphasized the king's <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> in this respect (op. cit., IV, 115). But <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> continued to be bestowed upon <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> especially in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and Lorraine, e.g. St. Evre near Toul, in the reign of Lothaire I. Lothaire II, however, restored it to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> control in 858, but the same king gave Bonmoutier to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>; and the Abbeys of St. Germain and St. Martin, in the Diocese of Toul, were also given to secular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Diocese of Metz</a>, the Abbey of Gorze was long in the hands of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, and under them fell into decay. Stavelot and Malm&eacute;dy, in the <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Diocese of Li&egrave;ge</a>, were in the eleventh century bestowed on a certain Count Raginarius, as also St. Maximin near <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> on a Count Adalhard, etc. (Hauck, "Kirchengeschichte Deutschland", II, 598). In 888 a Synod of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> decreed (can. xxv) that the secular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> should place able provosts and provisors over their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>.

<p>Councils, however, were unable to put an end to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; in a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at Trosly, in the <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Diocese of Soissons</a>, in 909, sharp complaints were made (ch. iii) about the lives of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, it was said, were governed by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, whose wives and children, soldiers and dogs, were housed in the precincts of the religious. To better these conditions it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, the synod declared, to restore the regular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> and abbesses; at the same time <a href="../cathen/03287a.htm">ecclesiastical canons</a> and royal capitularies declared <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> quite devoid of authority in church affairs (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, op. cit., IV, 572-73). Lay <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> existed in the tenth century, also in the eleventh. Gosfred, Duke of Aquitaine, was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Hilary at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, and as such he published the decrees issued (1078) at the Synod of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, op. cit., V, 116). It was only through the so-called investitures conflict that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was freed from secular domination; the reform of religious and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life brought about by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, put an end to the bestowal of <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> upon <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>.
