<h1>Lay Communion</h1>  

<p>The primitive <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a> established a different punishment for certain crimes according as they were committed by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. The former entailed a shorter and ordinarily lighter penance than the latter, which were punished with a special penalty. The <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> was excluded from the community of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, the cleric was excluded from the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> and reduced to the lay communion, that is to say, he was forbidden to exercise his functions. The nature of the latter punishment is not quite certain. According to one opinion, it consisted in <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, together with a prohibition to receive the Blessed Eucharist; according to another, the penitent was allowed to receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> but only with the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. Canon xv of the so-called Apostolical Canons (see <a href="../cathen/03279a.htm">APOSTOLIC CANONS</a>) forbids any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, residing outside his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> without authorization, to celebrate the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>, but grants him permission to receive the Eucharist along with the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. The canon lxii <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> that <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> during the persecutions were to be received among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. In 251, a letter of <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Pope Cornelius</a> to Fabius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, informs us that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in presence of all the people received into his communion, but as a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, one of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> guilty of having conferred <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> on the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>. A letter of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian of Carthage</a> mentions a certain Trophimus, who was admitted to communion among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. It would be easy to mention similar cases, in which we find it stated that the penitent was admitted to receive communion among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. The Council of Elvira (c. 300) which reveals to us in many ways the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> of an entire <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>, in canon lxxvi, &agrave;propos of a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, mentions the same discipline. This is the most ancient canonical text that speaks of the custom of lay communion. We do not cite the Council of Cologne (346) since its authenticity may yet be questioned. But from that time forward we find, in a series of councils, declarations which show conclusively that, when lay communion is mentioned, there is question of the reception of the Blessed Eucharist. Besides the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a>, those of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> (303), canon xli; Toledo (400), canon iv; <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (487) canon ii, are too explicit to admit of any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that we have here an established discipline. We may also cite the Councils of <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Agde</a> (506), canon 1; L&eacute;rida (524), canon v; Orl&eacute;ans (538), canon ii; etc.

<p>Speaking generally, the expression "lay communion" does not necessarily imply the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Eucharist, but only the condition of a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> in communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But as the Eucharist was granted only to those in communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to say that a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> was admitted to the lay communion is equivalent to saying that he received the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who passed from the condition of a penitent to the lay communion, had necessarily to be received by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> into the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, before being admitted to communion. There are no grounds for supposing that this transition implied an intermediate stage in which he who was admitted to the communion was deprived of the Blessed Eucharist. This discipline applied not only to those who were guilty of a secret <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but also to those who had for some time belonged to an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. But there was no absolute rule, since the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (325) received back the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> without imposing this penalty on them, while we see it enforced in the case of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>. In modern times lay communion is sometimes imposed, but only in exceptional cases, which need not be treated of here.
