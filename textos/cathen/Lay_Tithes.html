<h1>Lay Tithes</h1>  

<p>Under this heading must be distinguished (1) secular <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, which subjects on crown-estates were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to pay to princes, or tenants, or vassals on leased lands or lands held in fief to their landlords (<em>decim&aelig; origine laicales</em>), and (2) <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, which in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> became alienated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to lay proprietors (<em>decim&aelig; ex post laicales s. s&aelig;cularizat&aelig;</em>). There is question here only of the latter. In the secularizations initiated under the Merovingians the transference of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> and their <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> or of the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> alone to <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> was effected. In subsequent times church lands with their <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> alone, were bestowed even by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> on <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> to secure servants, vassals, protectors against <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and defenders of their civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> with <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> alone, were forcibly seized by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. Finally, the development of churches, once the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, into <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> gave rise to the landlord appropriating the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> due to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church. The church soon took measures to repress this spoliation, beginning as early as the ninth century at the Synod of Diedenhofen (844; cap. iii, 5) and that of <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a> (845; cap. iii, 6). <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> revived in a stricter form these old canons at the Autumn Synod of 1078, demanding that the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> should return all <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, even though they had been given them by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, kings, or other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and declared all who refused obedience to be <em>sacrilegi</em> (C. 1, C. XVI, q. 7). Succeeding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> repeated this order, declaring that Church <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to be <em>iuris divini</em> (C. 14, X, de decim., III, 30); that, as the inalienable source of income of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, they could not be transferred to another church or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (C. 30, X, de decim., III,30); that they could not be acquired by a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> through prescription or inheritance, or otherwise alienated.

<p>But it was quite impossible for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to recover the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> possessed for centuries by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, to whom in fact they had been in many cases transferred by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself. Laymen gave then, in preference to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> instead of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, but this became thenceforth subject to the approval of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (C. 3, X, do privil., III 33). The decision of the Lateran Council (1179), forbidding the alienation of the church <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> possessed by the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, and demanding their return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (C. 19, X. de decim., III, 30) was interpreted to mean that, those <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, which up to the time of this council were in possession of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, might be retained by them, but no further transference should take place (C. 25, X, de decim., III, 30, c. 2, A in Vito, h.t., III, 13). But even this could not be carried out. There thus existed side by side with church <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> a quantity of lay tithes; the latter were dealt. with by secular courts as being purely secular <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, while ecclesiastical law was applied to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>. However, certain of the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> imposed by the (once) <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> continued to bind the proprietor, even though he were a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. Thus in the case of church buildings the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> declared that <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patrons</a> and all "qui fructus aliquos ex dictis ecclesiis provenientes percipiunt" were bound secondarily to defray the cost of repair (Sess. XXI, De ref., c. vii; see FABRICA ECCLESI&AElig;). When there is a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to whether the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in question are ecclesiatical or lay, the reasonable presumption is that they are <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>.
