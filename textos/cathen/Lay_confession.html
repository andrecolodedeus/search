<h1>Lay confession</h1>  

<p>This article does not deal with confession <em>by</em> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> but with that made <em>to</em> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, for the purpose of obtaining the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It has no practical importance, and is treated merely from an historical point of view.

<p>It is found under two forms: first, confession without relation to the sacrament, second, confession intended to supply for the sacrament in case of necessity. In the first instance, it consists of confession of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> or daily faults which need not necessarily be submitted to the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>; in the second, it has to do with the confession of even grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which should be declared to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but which are confessed to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> because there is no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at hand and the case is urgent. In both cases the end sought is the merit of humiliation which is inseparable from freely performed confession; but in the first no administration of the sacrament, in any degree, is sought; in the second, on the contrary, sacramental confession is made to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> for want of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> and canonists in dealing with this subject usually have two historical texts a basis. The optional and meritorious confession of slight faults to any <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is set forth in <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede's</a> "Commentary on the Epistle of St. James": "Confess your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> one to another" (Confitemini alterutrum peccata vestra). "It should be done", says the holy doctor, "with discernment; we should confess our daily and slight faults mutually to our equals, and believe that we are saved by their daily <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. As for more grievous <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> (mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>), we should, according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, discover its impurity to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and according to his judgement carefully purify ourselves in the manner and time he shall fix" (In Ep. Jacob, c.v; P.L., XCIII, 39). Clearly <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> did not consider such mutual avowal a sacramental confession; he had in mind the monastic confession of faults. In the eleventh century <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> sets forth the same theory, but distinguishes between public <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and hidden faults; the first he reserves "to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, by whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> binds and looses", and authorizes the avowal of the second to all members of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a>, and in their absence to an upright man (vir mundus), and in the absence of an upright man, to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone ("De celanda confess.", P.L., CL. 629). So also Raoul l'Ardent, after having declared that the confession of venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be made to any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, even to an inferior" (cuilibet, etiam minori), but he adds this explanation: "We make this confession, not that the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> may absolve us; but because by reason of our own humiliation and accusation of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of our brethren, we may be purified of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: (Hom. lxiv, P.L., CLV, 1900). Confession to <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> made in this way has, therefore, no claim to a <a href="../cathen/03586a.htm">sacramental character</a> and provokes no <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> objection. The passage from <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> is frequently quoted by the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>.

<p>The other text on which is based the second form of confession to <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, is taken from a work widely read in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, the "De vera et falsa poenitentia", until the sixteenth century unanimously attributed to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and quoted as such (P.L., XL, 1122). Today it is universally regarded as <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>, though it would be difficult to determine its author. After saying that "he who wishes to confess his sins should seek a priest who can bind and loose", he adds these words often repeated as an axiom: "So great is the power of confession that if a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> be wanting, one may confess to his neighbour" (tanta vis est confessionis ut, si deest sacerdos, confiteatur proximo). He goes on to explain clearly the value of this confession made to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> in case of necessity: "Although the confession be made to one who has no power to loose, nevertheless he who confesses his crime to his companion becomes worthy of pardon through his desire for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>." Briefly, to obtain pardon, the sinner performs his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to the best of his ability, i.e. he is contrite and confesses with the desire of addressing himself to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; he hopes that the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will supply what in this point is lacking. The confession is not sacramental, if we may so speak, except on the part of the penitent; a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> cannot be the minister of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> and he is not regarded as such. Thus understood confession to <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> is imposed as <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> later only counselled or simply permitted, by the greater number of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> from Gratian and <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> to the sixteenth century and the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Though Gratian is not so explicit (can. 78, Dist. I, De Poenit.; can. 36, Dist. IV, De Cons.), the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master of the Sentences</a> (IV, dist. xvii) makes a real <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of confession to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> in case of necessity. After having demonstrated that the avowal of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (<em>confessio oris</em>) is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in order to obtain pardon, he declares that this avowal should be made first to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and in the absence of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, to one's neighbour (<em>socio</em>). This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> is found, with some differences, in many of his commentators, among them, Raymond of Penafort, who authorizes this confession without making it an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> (Summa, III, xxxiv, 84); <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a> (in Iv, dist. xvii, aa. 58, 59), who, arguing from <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> conferred by a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> in case of necessity, ascribes a certain sacramental value to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> by a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (in IV, dist. xvii, q. 3, art. 3, sol. 2) obliges the penitent to do what he can, and sees something sacramental (<em>quodammodo sacrametalis</em>) in his confession; he adds, and in this many followed him, that if the penitent survives he should seek real <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (cf. Bonav. In IV, sent., d. 17, p. 3, a. 1, q. 1, and Alex. of Hales, in IV, q. 19 m. 1, a. 1). <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>, on the other hand (in dist. xiv, q. 4; dist. xvii, q. 1), not only does not make this confession <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, but discovers therein certain dangers; after him John of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, Durandus of Saint-Pourcain, and Astesanus declare this practice merely licit. Besides the practical manuals for the use of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> may be mentioned the "Manipulus curatorum" of Guy de Montrocher (1333), the synodal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of William, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>, about 1325, which <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">oblige</a> sinners to confess to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> in case of necessity; all, however, agree in saying that there is no real <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> and that recourse should be had to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> if possible.

<p>Practice corresponds to theory; in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <em>chansons de gestes</em> and in annals and chronicles, examples of such confessions occur (see Laurain, "De l'intervetion des laiques, des diacres, et des abbesses dans l'administration de la P&eacute;nitence", Paris, 1897). Thus, Joinville relates (Hist. De S. Louis, &#167;70), that the army of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> having been put to flight by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, each one confessed to any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> he could find, and at need to his neighbour; he himself thus received the confession of Guy d'Ybelin, and gave him a kind of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> saying: "Je vous asol de tel pooir que Diex m'a donnei" (I absolve you with such power as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may have given me). In 1524 Bayard, wounded to death, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> before his cross-shaped sword-hilt and made his confession to his "maistre d'ostel" (Hist. De Bayard par le loyal serviteur, ch. lxiv-v). Neither theory nor practice, it will readily be seen, was <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> from a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> pint of view. But when <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> (Prop. Damn., 13) attacked and denied the power of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to administer <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, and maintained that <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> had a similar power, a reaction set in. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> was condemned by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>; this Council (sess. xiv, cap. 6, and can. 10), without directly occupying itself with confession to a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> in case of necessity, <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a> that only <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. Sixteenth-century authors, while not condemning the practice, declared it dangerous, e.g. the celebrated <a href="../cathen/01793b.htm">Martin Aspilcueta (Navarrus)</a> (Enchirid., xxi, n. 41), who with Dominicus Soto says that it had fallen into desuetude. Both theory and practice disappeared by degrees; at the end of the seventeenth century there remained scarcely a memory of them.
