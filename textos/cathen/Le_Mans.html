<h1>Le Mans</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF LE MANS (CENOMANENSIS).

<p>Comprises the entire Department of Sarthe. Prior to the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> it included 636 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and was one of the most extensive <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; at the time of the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a>, it lost some <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in Vendomois and Normandy and acquired some in Anjou. The Diocese of Le Mans embraced 665 communes from then up to the year 1855, when the Department of Mayenne was detached from it to form the Diocese of Laval. The origin of the Diocese of Le Mans has given rise to very complicated discussions among scholars, based on the value of the "Gesta domni Aldrici," and of the "Actus Pontificum Cenomannis in urbe degentium," both compiled during the episcopate of Aldric (832-857). The "Gesta" relate that Aldric had the bodies of Saints Julianus, Turibius, Pavatius, Romanus, Liborius, and Hadoindus, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Mans, brought to his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; the Acts make St. Julianus one of the seventy-two disciples of Christ and state that he arrived at Le Mans with two companions: Turibius, who became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> under <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus</a> (138-161), and Pavatius who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> under Maximinus (235-238) and under <a href="../cathen/02108b.htm">Aurelian</a> (270-275), in which event, Pavatius would have lived over two hundred years. Liborius, successor of Pavatius, would have been the contemporary of Valentinian (364-375). These chronological absurdities of the Acts have led Msgr Duchesne to conclude that the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Le Mans whose episcopate can be dated with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> is Victurius, who attended the Councils of Angers and of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, in 453 and 461, and to whom <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> alludes as "a venerable confessor." Turibius who, according to the Acts, was the successor of Julianus, was, on the contrary, successor to Victurius and occupied the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> from 490 to 496.

<p>Among the subsequent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Le Mans are mentioned the following <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: Principius (497-511), Innocentius (532-43), Domnolus (560-81), Bertechramnus or Bertram (587-623), founder of the Abbey of Notre-Dame de la Couture, Hadoindus (623-54), Berecharius or Beraire (655-70), and Aldric (832-57). If we admit the theory according to which the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">False Decretals</a> were compiled at Le Mans by the author of the "Actus pontificum," then Aldric must have used these <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> documents as a weapon against the institution of the <em><a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopi</a></em> and also against the pretensions of the Breton usurper Nomenoe to the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>. It was Aldric who had the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Liborius conveyed to <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Blessed Geoffroy de Loudun (1234-55), whom <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> made <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> for the entire Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and who, in 1254, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Le Mans and founded the superb <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Notre-Dame du Pare d'Orques, where he was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> and where <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought at his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>; and Martin Berruyer (1452-67), who left a memoir written in defence of <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a>. From 1468 to 1519 the See of Le Mans was occupied by <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the House of Luxembourg, and from 1519 to 1537 by their cousin, Louis de Bourbon. Jean, Cardinal du Bellay, Dean of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from 1546 to 1556; and <a href="../cathen/02723c.htm">Bouvier</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> from 1834 to 1854.

<p>During the episcopate of St. Berecharius (655-70) the body of St. Scholastica was brought from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06102c.htm">Fleury</a> to Le Mans; the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> erected to shelter the remains of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Northmen</a> in the second half of the ninth century. A portion of her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> was brought in 874 by the Empress Richilda to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Juvigny les Dames. The remaining portion was conveyed to the interior of the citadel and placed in the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of the collegiate <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Pierre la Cour, which served the counts of <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a> as a domestic <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. The fire that destroyed Le Mans, 3 September, 1134, also consumed the shrine of St. Scholastica, and only a few calcined bones were left. On 11 July, 1464, a confraternity was erected in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Scholastica, and on 23 November, 1876, she was officially proclaimed patroness of Le Mans. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of La Fl&egrave;che, founded in 1603 by Henry IV, enjoyed a great <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for a century and a half, and Marshal de Gu&eacute;briant, <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a>, <a href="../cathen/10209b.htm">Father Mersenne</a>, Prince Eugene of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, and S&eacute;guier were all numbered among its students. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Le Mans, begun about 1219, in fact during the lifetime of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>, was eminently prosperous, thanks to the benefactions of John of Troeren, an English lord; the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> <a href="../cathen/04091a.htm">Nicolas Coeffeteau</a>, who died in 1623, was one of its glories, prior to becoming <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> swept away this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>.

<p>The diocese honours in a special manner as <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: Peregrinus, Marcoratus, and Viventianus, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; Hilary of Oiz&eacute;, nephew of <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">St. Hilary of Poitiers</a> (in the fifth century); Bommer, Almirus, Leonard, and Ulphace, <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a>; Gault, Front, and Brice, solitaries and previously <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Micy; Fraimbault, <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, founder of a small <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the valley of Gabrone; Calais, <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> and founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Anisole, from whom the town of Saint-Calais took its name; Laumer, successor to St. Calais; Guingalois or Gu&eacute;nol&eacute;, founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Landevenec in Brittany, whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at Ch&acirc;teau du Loir; all in the sixth century: Rigomer, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at Soulign&eacute;, and T&eacute;nestine, his penitent, both of whom were acquitted before Childebert, through the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of Palaiseau, of accusations made against them (d. about 560); Longis, solitary, and Onofletta, his penitent; Siviard, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Anisole and author of the life of St. Calais (d. 681); the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> St. C&eacute;rota, and her mistress Osmana, daughter of a king of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, died a solitary near St-Brieuc, in the seventh century; M&eacute;n&eacute;l&eacute;, and Savinian (d. about 720), natives of Pr&eacute;cign&eacute;, who repaired to Auvergne to found the Abbey of M&eacute;nat, on the ruins of the hermitage where St. Calais had formerly lived; there is also a particular devotion in Le Mans to Blessed Ralph de La Fustaye, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> (twelfth century), disciple of <a href="../cathen/13096a.htm">Blessed Robert d'Arbrissel</a> and founder of the Abbey of St. Sulpice, in the forest of Nid de Merle in the <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Diocese of Rennes</a>. The celebrated Abbot de Rance made his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at the Abbey of Persaigne in the Diocese of Le Mans. Also there may be mentioned as natives of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, Urbain Grandier, the celebrated cur&eacute; of Loudun, burned to death for <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">sorcery</a> in 1634; and <a href="../cathen/10209b.htm">Mersenne</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10325a.htm">Minim</a> (d. 1648), <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and mathematician and friend of <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11511a.htm">Pascal</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Julian of Mans, rebuilt towards the year 1100, exhibits specimens of all styles of architecture up to the fifteenth century, its thirteenth-century choir being one of the most remarkable in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The church of Notre-Dame de la Couture dates from the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries. The Abbey of <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">Solesmes</a>, founded by Geoffroy de Sabl&eacute; in 993 and completed in 1095, has a thirteenth-century which is a veritable museum of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> of the end of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Its "Entombment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," in terra cotta, is famous; the <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Magdalen</a> in the group, already celebrated even in the fifteenth century for its beauty attracted the attention of <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a>, who thought of having it brought to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Several <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> depicting scenes in the life of the Blessed Virgin form a series unique in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>Pilgrimages to Notre-Dame de Toutes Aides at Saint-Remy du Plein, Notre-Dame de La Faigne at Pontvallain, and Notre-Dame des Bois at La Suze, date back to primitive times. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Notre Dame de Torc&eacute;, erected in the sixth century, has been much frequented by <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> since the eleventh century. Besides these places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> may be mentioned those of Notre-Dame de Labit at Domfront, and of Notre-Dame du Chene at Vion, near Sabl&eacute;, which can be traced to 1494. It was established in the place where in former times <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> had preached the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>.

<p>Prior to the application of the Associations law of 1901 there were in the Diocese of Le Mans, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">Solesmes</a>, where, through the efforts of <a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger</a>, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> house of the Congregation of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was founded in 1833. Several congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> originated in the diocese: the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Notre-Dame de l'Av&eacute; at La Fl&egrave;che, a teaching order, founded in 1622; the Sisters of the Visitation Sainte Marie, at Le Mans, a contemplative order founded in 1634; the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> at La Fl&egrave;che, a nursing order, founded in 1636; the Sisters of Charity of Providence, devoted to teaching and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> work, founded in 1806 by Abb&eacute; Dujari&eacute;, the mother-house being at Ruill&eacute;-sur-Loir; the Sisters of the Child Jesus, teachers and nurses, founded in 1835, with their mother-house at Le Mans; the Marianite <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a>, founded in 1841 with their mother-house at Le Mans and important <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> in New York and Louisiana; the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the Congregation of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> known as the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of St. Cecilia, founded at <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">Solesmes</a> in 1867 by <a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Dom Gu&eacute;ranger</a> and Mother Cecilia. At the close of the nineteenth century the following institutions in the diocese were under the direction of religious: 3 infants' asylums, 39 infants' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>, 10 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 3 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 2 houses of shelter, 2 reformatories, 32 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or hospices, 12 private <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and retreats, 1 asylum for idiots, 1 asylum for the blind, 1 asylum for insane <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and 8 homes for the aged. In 1905 (the last year of the concordatory regime), the Diocese of Le Mans had a population of 422,699, with 38 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 350 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of ease, and 111 curacies subventioned by the State.
