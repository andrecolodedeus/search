<h1>Le Moyne</h1>  

<p>The name of one of the most illustrious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>, whose deeds adorn the pages of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> history.
<h2>Charles le Moyne</h2>

<p>Founder of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, b. of Pierre Le Moyne and Judith Duchesne at Dieppe on 1 August, 1626; d. at Ville-Marie (Montreal), 1683. On reaching <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1641, he spent four years in the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> country, and then settled at Ville-Marie, his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Indian languages rendering him useful as an interpreter, and his valour contributing to defend the colony. He often fought single-handed against <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> marauders. This unusual <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a> encouraged the settlers to cultivate the soil. In 1653 he negotiated a peace which lasted five years. He married Catherine Primot in 1654. Surprised by a party of <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> in 1665, he was preparing to sell his life dearly, when he tripped and was captured. Awed by his valour and fearing reprisals, his captors did not torture, but soon released him. He accompanied Courcelles and <a href="../cathen/15006a.htm">Tracy</a> against the Five Nations and shared their success. In recognition of his services <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> ennobled him with the title of Sieur de Longueuil. He served as interpreter to Courcelles and the Governors of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> and <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a> during a visit to the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> country, and was rewarded by <a href="../cathen/14438a.htm">Intendant Talon</a> with a vast concession on the St. Lawrence, reaching from Varennes to Laprairie, henceforth named the Longueuil fief. He was the father of fourteen children, seven of whom <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> by their prowess, three dying in battle and four becoming governors of cities or provinces. Of his sons, surnamed for their <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a> the "Machabees of New France", the two most renowned are treated in separate articles (see <a href="../cathen/07614b.htm">PIERRE LE MOYNE, SIEUR D'IBERVILLE</a>; JEAN-BAPTITE LE MOYNE, SIEUR DE BIENVILLE); each of the five others deserves here a short notice.
<h2>Charles le Moyne</h2>

<p>The eldest son of the preceding, b. at Ville-Marie, 10 Dec., 1656; d. in 1729. After serving in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he returned to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> with the rank of lieutenant, and, at the age of twenty-seven, was appointed major of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> by Governor de la Barre. He married Elizabeth Souart. In 1700 he received for his services an additional grant of land and promotion to the rank of baron. He won fame in battle against the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> and in the defence of Quebec (1690). The cross of St. Louis was awarded him, and he was successively governor of <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a> and <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. In 1711 preceded by the religious standard <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered</a> by Jeanne Leber, he marched to Chambly against the invading army, which retreated on hearing of the wreck of Walker's fleet.
<h2>Jacques le Moyne</h2>

<p>Sieur de Sainte-H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, b. at Ville-Marie, 16 April, 1669; d. at Quebec, 1690. A soldier from early youth, he trained for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> his illustrious brother, d'Iberville. During Phipps's siege of Quebec, Ste-H&eacute;l&egrave;ne with 200 volunteers repulsed a troop of 1300 men commanded by Major Whalley, who had attempted to cross River St. Charles. Mortally wounded in this encounter, Ste-H&eacute;l&egrave;ne died shortly after, mourned by the whole colony for his courtesy and valour. The <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> of Onondaga sent a wampum collar as a token of sympathy, and released two captives to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> his memory.
<h2>Paul le Moyne</h2>

<p>Sieur de Marlcourt, b. 15 Dec., 1663; d. on 21 March, 1704. He accompanied d'Iberville to Hudson's Bay, and amply shared his success, particularly in boarding and capturing with only two canoes a large English cruiser. In 1690 he aided Ste-H&eacute;l&egrave;ne in defeating Whalley. Frontenac having undertaken a decisive campaign against the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, Maricourt forced them to surrender. Skilful diplomat as well as intrepid warrior, he was chosen to negotiate peace. His success was due to the affection and esteem of the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> for his uprightness, which moderated their dread of his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a>. They had begged him to act as their protector and mediator. In 1691 he married M. Madeleine Dupont de Neuville.
<h2>Fran&ccedil;ois le Moyne</h2>

<p>Sieur de Bienville I, b. 1666; d. 1691. After several valourous exploits, he was shot in an encounter with a party of Onneyouts at Repentigny while assailing the window of a house where they had taken refuge.
<h2>Joseph le Moyne</h2>

<p>Sieur de Serigny, b. 22 July, 1668; d. at Rochefort, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1704. A worthy emulator of d'Iberville, he commanded the vessels sent from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to enable his brother to take possession of Hudson's Bay. In that expedition, as well as in <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a> and Louisiana, he displayed great valour. With his brothers he drove the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> from Pensa-cola, after which he fortified Mobile and expelled the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> from Ile Dauphin. He was promoted captain in 1720, and in 1722 became Governor of Rochefort, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he died in 1734. He had married M Elisabeth Heron.
<h2>Louis le Moyne</h2>

<p>Sieur de Ch&acirc;teauguay I, b. 4 Jan., 1676, d. 1694. He fought under d'lberville at Hudson's Bay, assisting when only a boy at the capture of Fort Monsipi. In the years following he so often defeated the English that they were at last reduced to Fort Nelson (Bourbon), their most important post. This stronghold was likewise captured after a long and difficult attack, during which Ch&acirc;teauguay was killed at the age of eighteen.
<h2>Charles le Moyne</h2>

<p>Second baron de Longueuil, b. at Longueuil, 18 Oct., 1687: d. on 17 Jan., 1755. He entered the army quite young, and, after having served in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, was appointed major of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1733), and received the cross of St. Louis (1734). As Governor of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1749) he administered the colony after Jonqui&egrave;re's death. He saved from suppression the General Hospital of <a href="../cathen/15736c.htm">Venerable Madame d'Youville</a>, maliciously threatened with destruction. He married Catherine Charlotte de Gray in 1720.
<h2>Paul-Joseph le Moyne</h2>

<p>Born 1701; died at Port-Louis <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1778. Inheriting the military spirit of his ancestors, he joined the army at the age of seventeen, and served as lieutenant in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>. He was successively commander of Fort Frontenac, Governor of <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, of <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a>, and finally commander of the citadel of Quebec. He fought under <a href="../cathen/15311a.htm">Vaudreuil</a>, Montcalm, and L&eacute;vis, and won the cross of St. Louis. After the Conquest, he returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he died at Port-Louis in 1778. He married (1728) Genevi&egrave;ve Joybert de Soulanges.
<h2>Joseph-Dominique-Emmanuel le Moyne</h2>

<p>Second son of preceding, b. at Soulanges on 2 April, 1738. He began his military career at the age of twelve. After serving as captain and major under the French r&eacute;gime, he later served under the British flag after the change of domination, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravely</a> defending Fort St. John in 1755 against the American invaders. He was successively appointed inspector general of militia (1777), colonel of the Royal <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> (1796), and legislative councillor. He died in 1807.
