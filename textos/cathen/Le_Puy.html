<h1>Le Puy</h1>  

<p>(Aniciensis).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> comprising the whole Department of Haute Loire, and is a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>. The territory of the ancient Diocese of Le Puy, suppressed by the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a>, was united with the Diocese of Saint-Flour and became a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> again in 1823. The district of Brioude, which had belonged to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Saint-Fluor under the old regime, was thenceforward included in the new Diocese of Le Puy.

<p>The Martyrology of Ado and the first legend of St. Front of <a href="../cathen/11668a.htm">P&eacute;rigueux</a> (written perhaps in the middle of the tenth century, by Gauzbert, <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopus</a> of <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>) speak of a certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> named George who was brought to life by the touch of St. Peter's staff, and who accompanied St. Front, St. Peter's missionary and first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11668a.htm">P&eacute;rigueux</a>. A legend of <a href="../cathen/06453a.htm">St. George</a>, the origin of which, according to Duchesne is not earlier than the eleventh century, makes that saint one of the seventy-two disciples, and tells how he founded the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Civitas Vetula in the County of Le Velay, and how, at the request of <a href="../cathen/09721c.htm">St. Martial</a>, he caused an altar to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> to be erected on Mont Anis (Mons Anicius). After St. George, certain local traditions of very late origin point to Sts. Macarius, Marcellinus, Roricius, Eusebius, Paulianus, and Vosy (Evodius) as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Le Puy. It must have been from St. Paulianus that the town of Ruessium, now St. Paulien, received its name; and it was probably St. Vosy who completed the church of Our Lady of Le Puy at Anicium and transferred the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> from Ruessium to Anicium. St. Vosy was apprised in a vision that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> themselves had dedicated the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, whence the epithet <em>Angelic</em> given to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Le Puy. It is impossible to say whether this St. Evodius is the same who signed the decrees of the Council of <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a> in 374. Neither can it be affirmed that <a href="../cathen/02479b.htm">St. Benignus</a>, who in the seventh century founded a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at the gates of the basilica, and St. Agrevius, the seventh-century <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> from whom the town of Saint-Agr&egrave;ve Chiniacum took its name, were really <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Duchesne thinks that the <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> of these early <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> rests on very little evidence and that very ill supported by documents; before the tenth century only six <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> appear of whom it can be said with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that they were <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Le Puy. The first of these, Scutarius, the legendary architect of the first <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dates, if we may trust the inscription which bears his name, from the end of the fourth century.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Le Puy are mentioned: Adh&eacute;mar of Monteil (1087-1100), author of the ancient antiphon, "Salve Regina", whom <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a>, coming to Le Puy in 1095 to preach the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a>, appointed his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, and who died under the walls of Antioch; Bertrand of Chalencon (1200-13), who himself led the soldiers of his province against the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> under the walls of B&eacute;ziers; Guy III Foulques (1257-59), who became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a>; the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> Durandus of Saint-Pour&ccedil;ain (1318-26); Lefranc de Pompignan (1733-74), the great antagonist of the <em>philosophes</em>; De Bonald (1823-39), afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>.

<p>Legend traces the origin of the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of Le Puy to an apparition of the Blessed Virgin to a sick <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> whom <a href="../cathen/09721c.htm">St. Martial</a> had converted. No <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> was more frequented in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> came twice, in 772 and 800; there is a legend that in 772 he established a foundation at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> for ten poor canons (<em>chanoines de paup&eacute;rie</em>), and he chose Le Puy, with Aachen and Saint-Gilles, as a centre for the collection of <a href="../cathen/11774a.htm">Peter's Pence</a>. Charles the Bald visited Le Puy in 877, Eudes in 892, Robert in 1029, <a href="../cathen/12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a> in 1183. <a href="../cathen/09368a.htm">Louis IX</a> met the King of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> there in 1245; and in 1254 passing through Le Puy on his return from the Holy Land, he gave to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> an ebony image of the Blessed Virgin clothed in gold brocade. After him, Le Puy was visited by Philip the Bold in 1282, by <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a> in 1285, by Charles VI in 1394, by Charles VII in 1420, and by the mother of <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Blessed Joan of Arc</a> in 1429. Louis XI made the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> in 1436 and 1475, and in 1476 halted three leagues from the city and went to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> barefooted. Charles VIII visited it in 1495, <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> in 1533. Theodulph, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, brought to Our Lady of Le Puy, as an ex-voto for his deliverance, a magnificent Bible, the letters of which were made of plates of gold and silver, which he had himself put together, about 820, while in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> at Angers. St. Mayeul, St. Odilon, St. Robert, <a href="../cathen/07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a> of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, <a href="../cathen/01556a.htm">St. Anthony of Padua</a>, <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>, St. Vincent Ferrer, <a href="../cathen/08464a.htm">St. John Francis Regis</a> were <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to Le Puy.



<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Le Puy received, on account of its great dignity and fame, innumerable temporal and spiritual favours. Concessions made in 919 by William the Young, Count of Auvergne and Le Velay, and in 923 by King Raoul, gave it sovereignty over the whole population of the town (<em>bourg</em>) of Anis, a population which soon amounted to 30,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. In 999, Sylvester II <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> his friend Th&eacute;odard, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Aurillac, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Le Puy, to replace Stephen of Gevaudan, whom his uncle Guy, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Le Puy, had in his lifetime, designated to be his successor, and whom a Roman council had <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Sylvester II exempted Th&eacute;odard from all <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, a privilege which <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> confirmed to the Bishops of Le Puy, also granting them the right, until then reserved to <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> exclusively of wearing the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>. "Nowhere", he said in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "does the Blessed Virgin receive a more special and more filial worship." It was from Le Puy that <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> dated (15 August, 1095) the Letters Apostolic convoking the Council of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>, and it was a canon of Le Puy, Raymond d'Aiguilles, chaplain to the Count of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, who wrote the history of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>. Gelasius II, <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a>, <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> and <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> visited Le Puy to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and with the visit of one of these <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> must be connected the origin of the great jubilee which is granted to Our Lady of Le Puy whenever <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> falls on 25 March, the Feast of the Annunciation. It is supposed that this jubilee was instituted by <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a>, who passed through Le Puy, in April, 1119, or by <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, who was there in August, 1162, and June, 1165, or by <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a>, who had been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Le Puy. The first jubilee historically known took place in 1407, and in 1418 the chronicles mention a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> prolonging the duration of the jubilee It took place three times in the nineteenth century &#151; in 1842, 1853, and 1864 &#151; and will take place again in 1910. Lastly, during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, everyone who had made the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Le Puy had the privilege of making a will <em>in extremis</em> with only two witnesses instead of seven.

<p>Honoured with such prerogatives as these, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Le Puy assumed a sort of primacy in respect to most of the Churches of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and even of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. This primacy manifested itself practically in a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to beg, established with the authorization of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, in virtue of which the chapter of Le Puy levied a veritable tax upon almost all the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> countries to support its <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of Notre-Dame. In Catalonia this <em>droit de quete</em>, recognized by Spanish Crown, was so thoroughly established that the chapter had its collectors permanently installed in that country. A famous "fraternity" existed between the chapter of Le Puy and that of <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">Gerona</a> in <a href="../cathen/03428a.htm">Catalonia</a>. The efforts of <a href="../cathen/13104b.htm">M. Rochet</a> to establish his contention, that this "fraternity" dated from the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, have been fruitless; M. Coulet has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the earliest document in which it is mentioned dates only from 1470, and he supposes that at this <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the chapter of <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">Gerona</a>, in order to escape the financial thraldom which bound it, like so many other Catalonian Churches, to the chapter of Le Puy, alleged its "fraternity" involving its equality &#151; with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Le Puy. In 1479 and in 1481 Pierre Bouvier, a canon of Le Puy, came to <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">Gerona</a>, when the canons invoked against him certain legends according to which <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> had taken Gerona, rebuilt its <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, given it a canon of Le Puy for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and established a fraternity between chapters of <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">Gerona</a> and Le Puy. In support of these legends they appealed to the Office which they chanted for the feast of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> &#151; an Office, dating from 1345, but in which they had recently inserted these tales of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of LePuy. In 1484 <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> prohibited the use of this Office, whereupon there appeared at <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">Gerona</a> the "Tractatus de captione Gerunde", which reaffirmed the Gerona legends about the fraternity with Le Puy. Down to the last days of the old regime the two chapters frequently exchanged courtesies; canons of Le Puy passing through Gerona and canons of <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">Gerona</a> passing through Le Puy enjoyed special privileges. In 1883 the removal by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">Gerona</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, which stood in that <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, marked the definitive collapse of the whole fabric of legends out of which the <em>hermandad</em> between Le Puy and Gerona had grown.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Our Lady of Le Puy and the other treasures escaped the pillage of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The roving banditti were victoriously dispersed, in 1180, by the Confraternity of the <em>Chaperons</em> (Hooded Cloaks) founded at the suggestion of a canon of Le Puy. In 1562 and 1563 Le Puy was successfully defended against the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a> by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious armed with cuirasses and arquebusses. But in 1793 the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> was torn from its shrine and burned in the public square. <a href="../cathen/12667b.htm">P&egrave;re de Ravignan</a>, in 1846, and the Abb&eacute; Combalot, in 1850, were inspired with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a great monument to the Blessed Virgin on the Rocher Corneille. <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a> placed at the disposal of Bishop Morlhon 213 pieces of artillery taken by P&eacute;lissier at Sebastopol, and the colossal <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of "Notre-Damede France" cast from the iron of these guns, amounting in weight to 150,000 kilogrammes, or more than 330,000 lbs. avoirdupois, was dedicated 12 September, 1860.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> specially <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: St. Domninus, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, whose body is preserved in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; St. Julian of Brioude, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> in 304, and his companion, St. Ferr&eacute;ol; St. Calminius (Carmery), Duke of Auvergne, who prompted the foundation of the Abbey of Le Monastier, and St. Eudes, first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> (end of the sixth century); St. Theofredus (Chaffre), <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Le Monastier and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> under the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> (c. 735); St. Mayeul, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny, who, in the second half of the tenth century, cured a blind man at the gates of Le Puy, and whose name was given, in the fourteenth century, to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in which the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> made their studies; St. Odilon, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny (962-1049), who embraced the life of a regular canon in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Julien de Brioude; St. Robert d'Aurillac (d. 1067) who founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Chaise Dieu in the Brioude district; St. Peter Chavanon (d. 1080), a canon regular, founder and first <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the Abbey of P&eacute;brac. At the age of eighteen <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">M. Olier</a>, afterwards the founder of Saint-Sulpice, was Abbot <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em> of P&eacute;brac and, in 1626 was an "honorary count-canon of the chapter of St. Julien de Brioude". We may mention as natives of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>: the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, Hughes Lanthenas (1634-1701), who edited the works of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> and <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, and was the historian of the Abbey of Vend&ocirc;me; the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, Jacques Boyer joint author of <a href="../cathen/06350c.htm">"Gallia Christiana"</a>; Cardinal de Polignac (d. 1741), author of the "Antilucretius".

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Le Puy, which forms the highest point of the city, rising from the foot of the Rocher Corneille, exhibits architecture of every period from the fifth century to the fifteenth. Formerly, the visitor passed through a <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> standing well out from the building and, after descending beneath the pavement, emerged by a stairway in front of the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>; the principal stairway is now covered by a bold vaulting which serves as base for one half of the church. The <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> effect is incredibly audacious and picturesque. The four galleries of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> were constructed during a period extending from the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> epoch to the twelfth century. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Chaise Dieu united in 1640 to the Congregation of St-Maur, still stands, with the fortifications which Abbot de Chanac caused to be built between 1378 and 1420, and the church, rebuilt in the fourteenth century by <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>, who had made his studies here, and by <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a>, his nephew. This church contains the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>. The fine church of S. Julien de Brioude, in florid Byzantine style, dates from the eleventh or twelfth century. Besides the great <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of Le Puy, we may mention those of Notre-Dame de Pradelles, at Pradelles, a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from 1512; of Notre-Dame d'Auteyrac, at Sorlhac, which was very popular before the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>; of Notre-Dame Trouv&eacute;e, at Lavoute-Chilhac.

<p>Before the passage of the Law of Associations (1901) there were at Le Puy, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Religious of St. Mary of the Assumption, and, <a href="../cathen/09749c.htm">Little Brothers of Mary</a>. Two important congregations of men originated and had their mother-house, in the diocese. Of these the <a href="../cathen/13305a.htm">Brothers of the Sacred Heart</a>, founded in 1821 with the object of giving commercial instruction, have their mother-house at Paradis and important boarding-schools at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, as well as in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> (chiefly Baie Saint-Louis) and in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> (chiefly at Athabaskaville). The Labourer Brothers, or Farmer Brothers, of St. John Francis R&eacute;gis were founded in 1850 by P&egrave;re de Bussy, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, and possess seven model farms for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of poor children. A certain number of congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> originated in the diocese. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> of M&egrave;re Agn&egrave;s, who taught and served as sick nurses and housekeepers, were founded in 1221; the teaching Sisters of Notre-Dame, in 1618; the religious of St. Charles, teachers and nurses, in 1624, by Just de Serres, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Le Puy; the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and teaching <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, in 1650, by P&egrave;re M&eacute;daille, who were the first congregation placed under the patronage of St. Joseph; the contemplative religious of the Visitation of St. Mary were founded in 1659; those of the Instruction of the Infant Jesus, for teaching in 1667, by the celebrated Sulpician Tronson, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of St. Georges, and his penitent, Mlle Martel; the Sisters of the Cross, for <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> service and teaching, in 1673.

<p>At the end of the nineteenth century the religious congregations possessed in the Diocese of Le Puy: 69 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (<em>&eacute;coles maternelles</em>), 2 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for deaf mutes, 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for boys, 6 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for girls, 1 refuge for penitent <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 20 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or hospices, 1 <a href="../cathen/08038b.htm">lunatic asylum</a>, 3 old men's homes, 57 houses of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the care of the sick at home. In 1905 (end of the Concordat period) the diocese had 314,058 inhabitants, 33 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 243 auxiliary <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (<em>succursales</em>), and 195 state-paid vicariates.
