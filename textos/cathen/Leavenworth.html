<h1>Leavenworth</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of Leavenworth (Leavenworthensis).

<p>Suffragan to St. Louis. When established, 22 May, 1877, it comprised the <a href="../cathen/08597a.htm">State of Kansas</a>, U. S. A., with the Right Rev. Louis Mary Fink, O.S.B. as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. At his request, ten years later the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> divided the diocese into three: Wichita, <a href="../cathen/04206a.htm">Concordia</a>, and Leavenworth. Leavenworth was then restricted to the 43 counties lying east of Republic, Cloud, <a href="../cathen/11352a.htm">Ottawa</a>, Saline McPherson, Harvey, Sedgwick and Sumner Counties. The diocese had an area of 28,687 sq. m., with a total population in 1890, of 901,536. Authorized by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, Bishop Fink on 29 May, 1891, took up his residence in <a href="../cathen/08602a.htm">Kansas City</a>, Kans., and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was named after this city for some years. <a href="../cathen/01640a.htm">Apostolic letters</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1 July, 1897, further diminished the territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in favour of <a href="../cathen/04206a.htm">Concordia</a> and <a href="../cathen/15616a.htm">Wichita</a>. It now includes only the Counties of Anderson, Osage, Pottawatomie, Shawnee Wabaunsee, Wyandotte, Jackson, Jefferson, Linn, Lyon, Marshall, Miami, Nemaha, Atchison, Brown, Coffey, Doniphan, Douglas, Franklin, Johnson, and Leavenworth; an area of 12,594 sq. miles.

<p>The first missionary to the wild Indians of the plains, within the present borders of <a href="../cathen/08597a.htm">Kansas</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11385a.htm">Father Juan de Padilla</a>. He obtained the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> crown just fifty years after <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> discovered the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>. The first permanent Indian missions in these parts were established by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> among the <a href="../cathen/12320a.htm">Potawatomies</a> and Osages. The latter originally dwelt on both sides of the Missouri. They <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of <a href="../cathen/09690a.htm">Father Marquette</a> and had implored Father Garvier to preach to them. Two <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> had been among them in 1745. Bishop Dubourg promised them missionaries in 1820. The Pottawatomies came from <a href="../cathen/10280a.htm">Michigan</a> and <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>. Some hundreds of them had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02200b.htm">Rev. S.T. Badin</a> of Kentucky, the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. In <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, Father Deseilles was succeeded among the <a href="../cathen/12320a.htm">Potawatomies</a> by Father Petit, who accompanied them to the confines of their new reservation in the Indian Territory, which then included Kansas. The Indian converts were confirmed by <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Bishop P. Kenrick</a> in 1843, and by <a href="../cathen/16007a.htm">Bishop Barron</a> in 1845. An Indian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Oklahoma Diocese is descended from the Pottawatomies and was born in <a href="../cathen/08597a.htm">Kansas</a>. In 1845 by the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> efforts of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12350a.htm">prayer-books</a> in the Pottawatomie dialect were given to the Indians. Manual training <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls and boys had been established some years previously. The latter were conducted by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Bishop Rosati wrote from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> that <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> would be delighted to have a Sacred Heart <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> among the Indians. In the year 1841 the Religious of the Sacred Heart opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> among the Pottawatomies under the leadership of Mother Philippine-Rose Duchesne. Manual training <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were established among the Osages in 1847. Here also the boys' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was under the conduct of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; but the girls' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was in charge of the Sisters of Loretto.

<p>Kansas was under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> until St. Louis was made an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. The Vicariate Apostolic of the Indian Territory east of the Rocky Mountains included the present states of <a href="../cathen/08597a.htm">Kansas</a>, <a href="../cathen/10729b.htm">Nebraska</a>, <a href="../cathen/11230c.htm">Oklahoma</a>, that part of North and <a href="../cathen/14160a.htm">South Dakota</a> west of the Missouri River, <a href="../cathen/15724b.htm">Wyoming</a>, <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a>, and a part of <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a>. It was placed under Rt. Rev. John B. Mi&egrave;ge, S.J., who was appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Messenia, in St. Louis, 25 March, 1851. Accompanied by Father Paul Ponziglione, S.J., who was to devote himself for forty years to the Indians and early white settlers of the new vicariate, Bishop Mi&egrave;ge arrived among the Pottawatomies on the Kansas River, where now stands St. Mary's College, in May of that year. The founder of the Pottawatomie mission of the Immaculate Conception, Father Christian Hoecken, S.J., while ascending the Missouri River with Father P.J. de Smedt, died of cholera, at the age of forty-three years (19 June, 1851), fifteen of which were passed among the Indians in the Missouri Valley.

<p>Bishop Mi&egrave;ge was born 18 September, 1815, at La For&ecirc;t, Upper <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He studied classics and philosophy at the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Moutiers where his elder brother Urban was a teacher for over forty years. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> 23 Oct., 1836; was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 7 Sept. 1847, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was professor of Philosophy in the Roman College. Driven from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> by the political troubles of the following year, he was sent at his own request to the Indian Missions in the United States. In 1849 he was assistant <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Charles's church at St. Charles, Missouri. In 1850 he was <em>socius</em> of the master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> at Florissant. He also taught <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> there. The vicariate subjected to his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in 1851 consisted mostly of Indian missions. There were five churches, ten Indian Nations, and eight <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, with a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of almost 5000, of whom 3000 were Indians. He was an indefatigable missionary, traversing on horseback and by wagon for years the wild remote regions over which his people were scattered, visiting the Indian villages, forts, trading posts, and growing towns. In August, 1855, there were seven <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> in Leavenworth, and he moved his residence from the Pottawatomie mission, to this city for a permanent location to minister to the fast increasing tide of immigration that had turned to Kansas. In 1856 the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> began a foundation at Donipfan, near Atchison, but a short time afterwards they established a <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in the latter city. They were followed by the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> in 1864. Father Theodore Heimann, a German, who later joined the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Fathers; Father J. H. Defouri, from <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>; and Father Ambrose T. Butler, from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> were among the first <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> to come to the assistance of Bishop Mi&egrave;ge, who was represented at the second <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, and went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1853. He assisted at provincial councils in St. Louis in 1855 and 1858. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> soon had a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> wherever there was a resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He built a noble <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Leavenworth. Before leaving for the Ecumenical Council of the Vatican, he appointed the Very Rev. L. M. Fink, Prior of St. Benedict's, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> <em>in spiritualibus</em>, and Father Michael J. Corbett, administrator <em>in temporalibus</em>. Nebraska, part of the Dakotas, <a href="../cathen/15724b.htm">Wyoming</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a>) continued until May, 1859. The increase in the Kansas Territory, which extended west to the Rocky Mountains, was steady. Desiring to return to the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, Bishop Mi&egrave;ge petitioned to be allowed to resign his episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and in 1871 a coadjutor was given him in the Very Rev. Louis M. Fink, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Atchison, and who had as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> worked on the missions in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>, and Illinois. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> 11 June, 1871, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05572b.htm">Eucarpia</a>.



<p>Bishop Mi&egrave;ge then went on a begging tour in aid of the vicariate and spent three years collecting in South America. His petition to be allowed to resign was granted in December, 1874, when he returned to his order, being assigned to the house of studies at Woodstock, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. In 1877 he was sent to Detroit where he founded a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> and remained until 1880, when he was appointed <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a> at Woodstock for three years. Here he died 21 July, 1884.

<p>In 1874 Bishop Fink took charge of the vicariate on the resignation of Bishop Mi&egrave;ge; and 22 May, 1877, it was established as the Diocese of Leavenworth, and his title was transferred to this see. He was born 12 July, 1834, at Triftersberg, Baveria, and <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> in boyhood to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. He entered the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> in September, 1852, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at St. Vincent's Abbey, Beatty, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, 27 May, 1857. When he assumed <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in 1874, there were within the boundaries of <a href="../cathen/08597a.htm">Kansas</a> 65 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 88 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 3 colleges, 4 academies, 1 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, 13 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 1700 pupils; and communities of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> priests; of Religious of the Sacred Heart, of Sisters of St. Benedict, of Sisters of Charity, and of Sisters of Loretto; with a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of nearly 25,000. In 1887 there were in Kansas 137 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 216 churches. The decrees of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod are admirable. The two new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/15616a.htm">Wichita</a> and Concordia took from the diocese over 69,000 sq. miles. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were placed under the supervision of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> board that selects textbooks, and examines teachers and pupils. He fostered the Association of the Holy Childhood, the sodalities of the Blessed Virgin, and the Holy Angels; established the Confraternity of the Holy Family throughout the diocese and acted as <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> director of the League of the Sacred Heart. Bishop Fink took part in the Third Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and sedulously endeavoured to enforce its decrees. He continued to promote the progress of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> until his death, 17 March, 1904.

<p>There were then 110 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 100 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 13 stations and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 37 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 4000 pupils, and 35,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. On his demise the Very Rev. Thomas Moore, who had been <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> since 1899, was made Apostolic administrator.

<p>The successor of Bishop Fink was the Very Rev. Thomas F. Lillis, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08602a.htm">Diocese of Kansas City</a>, who was born at Lexington, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, in 1862, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1885. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Leavenworth, in <a href="../cathen/08602a.htm">Kansas City</a>, 27 December, 1904. His episcopal administration of the Leavenworth Diocese was eminently successful. The growth of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was marked by the foundation of new congregations, and the building of churches and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> were strengthened and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> revised to enforce the decrees of the Third Plenary Council of Baltimeore under present conditions. He adopted practical means of enforcing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> "Motu Proprio"' on <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">Church music</a>. In March, 1910, he was appointed coadjutor to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08602a.htm">Kansas City</a>, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, <em>cum jure successionis</em>.
