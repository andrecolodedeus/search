<h1>Lectern</h1>  

<p>(Lecturn, Letturn, Lettern, from <em>legere</em>, to read).

<p>Support for a book, reading-desk, or bookstand, a solid and permanent structure upon which the Sacred Books, which were generally large and heavy, were placed when used by the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the altar in <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> functions. In early days only one such structure was employed; later, two were erected, one at the northern wall of the choir, and another on the opposite side. From the former the sermon was delivered by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and also by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, unless he spoke from his <em>cathedra</em>; here decrees of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, censures and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunications</a> pronounced, the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> read, the Gospel chanted by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and all those parts of the liturgy were sung which belonged to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> office. The other, somewhat longer but not so high, was divided into two compartments or stories--the higher, facing the altar, was used by the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> when reading the Epistle; in the other, facing the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, the other lessons were read. A third lectern was used in some churches for the sermon. Some of these were built of marble, others of wood, highly adorned with silver and gold, enamelled, and set with precious stones, covered with bronze plates and carvings in <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a>. Besides those mentioned under Ambo, we find among the treasures of the Abbey of Saint-Riquier "lectoria tria ex marmore, argento et auro fabricata" (P.L., CLXXIV, 1257). One in the court of the church of St. Pantalaemon in Thessalonica is held to be the oldest. On its lower part is found in relief the Madonna and Child, seated on a throne and surrounded by shepherds and the three <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, and on the superstructure are symbolic representations. The upper part of the lectern in S. Apollinare Nuovo at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> is old and fairly complete. Another, well preserved and richly decorated, a donation of Henry II, is at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>. Movable lecterns were also made of wood, bronze, or polished brass. A bronze lectern inlaid with <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a>, made about the middle of the twelfth century by Sugar, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Denis, was in the shape of an eagle whose outspread wings held the book. Eagle-shaped lecterns were also numerous in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Samples, but not going back later than the fifteenth century, are found at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, Dusseldorf, St. Severin's at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, etc. A lectern of neatly wrought iron, in the shape of an X, which can be folded, is in the Musee Cluny at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> of <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a> had a lectern which was a large column of copper, in <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> style, supporting a phoenix surrounded by the four animals of the Prophet Ezechiel. In some the figure of a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> holds the book.

<p>The Synods of Munster (1279), <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> (1287), and Cambrai (1300) prescribed that the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, enveloped in a linen cloth, should be laid on the altar. Towards the end of the thirteenth century a cushion came into use. The oldest notice of a stand for the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> is found in an inventory of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Angers of the year 1297 (Zeitschrift fur christliche Kunst, X, 175). All such lecterns were covered on festivals with rich cloths of silver and gold. At the present day lecterns are in use as Missal-stands and for the reading of the prophecies on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> and Pentecost Saturday, for the chanting of the Passion, the singing of the <a href="../cathen/05730b.htm">"Exultet"</a>, and the reading of the lessons in choirs.
