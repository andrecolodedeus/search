<h1>Lectionary</h1>  

<p>(<em>Lectionarium</em> or <em>Legenda</em>).

<p><em>Lectionary</em> is a term of somewhat vague significance, used with a good deal of latitude by <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> writers. It must be remembered that in the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> neither the Liturgy of the Mass, nor the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> recited by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> in choir, were to be found, as in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> of the present day, complete in one volume. Both for the Mass and for the Office a variety of books were used, for it was obviously a matter of convenience when books were both bulky and costly to produce that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, e.g. which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> had to say at the altar, should be contained in a different volume from the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> to be sung by the choir. The word <em>lectionary</em>, then, in its wider sense, is a term which may be correctly applied to any <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> volume containing passages to be read aloud in the services of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In this larger signification it would include all Scriptural books written continuously, in which readings were marked, such as the "Evangeliaria" (also often known as "Textus"), as well as books, known also as "Plenaria", containing both Epistles and Gospels combined, such as are commonly employed in a high Mass at the present day, and also those collections, either of extracts from the Fathers or of historical narrations about the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, which were read aloud as lessons in the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>. This wider signification is, however, perhaps the less usual, and in practice the term lectionary is more commonly used to denote one of two things: (1) the book containing the collection of Scriptural readings which are chanted by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> during Mass; (2) any book from which the readings were taken which are read aloud in the Office of <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>, after each nocturn or group of psalms. With regard to these last the practice seems to have varied greatly. Sometimes collections were made containing just the extracts to be used in choir, such as we find them in a modern <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>. Sometimes a large volume of patristic <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> (known also as <em>sermonarium</em>) or historical matter was employed, in which certain passages were marked to be used as lessons. This last custom seems more particularly to have obtained with regard to the short biographical accounts of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, which in our modern <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> form the lessons of the second nocturn. In this connection the word <em>legenda</em> in particular is of common occurrence. The <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandist</a> Poncelet is, consequently, inclined to draw a distinction between the "Legenda" and the "Lectionarium" (see Analecta Bollandiana, XXIX, 13). The "Legenda", also called "Passionarium" is a collection of narratives of variable length, in which are recounted the life, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, translation, or <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. This usually forms a large volume, and the order of the pieces in the collection is commonly, though not necessarily, that of the calendar. A few such "Legend&aelig;" come down from quite the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. But the vast majority of those now preserved in our <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> belong to the eleventh, twelfth. and thirteenth centuries. The earliest, is the "Codex Velseri", <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Lat. 3514, of the Royal Library at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, written probably before the year 700. When these books were used in choir during Office the reader either read certain definitely marked passages, indicated by markings of which our existing <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> constantly show traces, or, in the earlier periods especially, he read on until the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who presided gave him the signal to stop. After the thirteenth century however, this type of book was much more rarely transcribed. It was replaced by what may conveniently be called for distinction's sake the "Lectionarium" <em>par excellence</em>, a book which consisted not of entire narratives, but only of extracts arranged according to feasts, and made expressly to be read in the Office. It may be added that about the same period the still more comprehensive <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical book</a>, known to us so familiarly as the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> also began to make its appearance. In the early centuries the Scriptural passages to be read at Mass, whether taken from the Gospels, the Epistles, or the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, were very commonly included in one book, often called a "Comes" or "Liber Comicus". But no constant or uniform practice was followed, for sometimes the Epistles and Lessons were read from a continuous text equipped with <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> indicating the different days for which the passages were intended &mdash; this is the case with the famous "Epistolarium" of <a href="../cathen/15414c.htm">St. Victor of Capua</a> in the sixth century; sometimes Lessons, Epistles, and Gospels were all transcribed in their proper order into one volume, as in the case of the Liber Comicus" of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Toledo lately edited by Dom Morin, or of the Lectionnaire de Luxeuil, published by <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> in his "Liturgia Gallicana".
