<h1>Lector</h1>  

<p>A <em>lector</em> (reader) in the West is a clerk having the second of the four <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>. In all <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> also, readers are <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to a <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor order</a> preparatory to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>. The primary reason for a special class of readers was the need of some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> sufficiently <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> to be able to read the books in church, for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> continued the Jewish practice of reading the Sacred Books publicly. The first mention of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> reader is by <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin Martyr</a> (d. about 165) in I Apol., lxvii, 3, 4. The <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> known as <a href="../fathers/1011.htm">"II Clem. ad Corinthios"</a> also contains a reference to a lector, <em>anaginoskon</em> (xix, 1). The position of reader was honourable and dignified. It involved a higher standard of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> than that of most offices. Although <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> says that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> preached the sermon, it appears that the reader himself often went on to expound what he had read. As the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> obtained that a special blessing and dedication should be given to everyone who performs an office for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the reader too was instituted by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and some <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. Readers were blessed and set apart, as were the <em>fossores</em> who dug graves, the <em>notarii</em> who kept registers, and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>. All the group of rituals that depend on the "Apostolic Constitutions" contain the rite of ordaining readers. "Apost. Const.", vii, xxii, tells the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to ordain a reader by laying on his hand and saying a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, which is given. The derived documents however forbid an <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>. ("Epitome Const. Ap.", xiii; Funk, "Didascalia", <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, 1905, II, p. 82; see also the "Egyptian Church Order", V, ib., p. 105).

<p>During the first centuries all the lessons in the liturgy, including the Epistle and Gospel, were read by the lector. <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius I</a> (251-53) in a letter to Fabius of Antioch mentions that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> has forty-two <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> and fifty-two <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcists</a>, readers and doorkeepers. (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchiridion", n. 45). In the fourth century in Africa the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/04295a.htm">Cirta</a> had four <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, three <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, four <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, and seven readers. The account of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> ("Gesta apud Zenophilum" printed in the appendix to Optatus of Mileve in the <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> edition of "Corp. Script. eccl. lat.", XXVI, 185-97) describes how the readers kept the sacred books which the magistrate demanded to be given up (p. 187). An old set of Western canons, ascribed (wrongly) to a supposed <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> in 398, but really of the sixth century, gives forms for all ordinations. Canon 8 is about our subject: "When a reader is <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> speak about him (<em>faciat de illo verbum</em>) to the people, pointing out his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and life and skill. After this, while the people look on, let him give him the book from which he is to read, saying to him: Receive this and be the spokesman (<em>relator</em>) of the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and you shall have, if you do your work faithfully and usefully, a part with those who have administered the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, op. cit., n. 156). But gradually the lectorate lost all importance. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> obtained the office of reading the Gospel; in the West the Epistle became the privilege of the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> this and other lessons are still supposed to be read by a lector, but everywhere his office (as all <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>) may be supplied by a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. The lector is still mentioned twice in the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> at the beginning it is said that if Mass be sung without <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> a lector wearing a <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a> may sing the Epistle in the usual place; but at the end he does not <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> the celebrant's hand (Ritus celebr. Missam", vi, 8). On <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> the morning service begins with a prophecy read by a lector at the place where the Epistle is usually read (first <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a> on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>).

<p>Everywhere the order of reader has become merely a stepping-stone to major orders, and a memory of early days. In the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> in is the second <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor order</a> (<em>Ostiarius, Lector, <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">Exorcista</a>, Acolythus</em>). The <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> are conferred during Mass after the first Lesson; but they may be given apart from Mass, on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> or doubles, in the morning. The lectorate involves no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> or of any other kind. The Byzantine Office will be found in the "Euchologion" (<em>Euchologion to mega</em>, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> 8th edition, 1898, pp. 186-87). The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> (Gregorian and Uniate) have adopted the Roman system of four <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> exactly. Their rite of ordaining a reader also consists essentially in handing to him the book of the Epistles.
