<h1>Leeds</h1>  

<p>(LOIDIS; LOIDENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> embracing the West Riding of Yorkshire, and that part of the city of York to the south of the River Ouse. Though one of the fourteen <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> now comprised in the Province of Westminster, it was not erected at the time of the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1850. For in that year the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, whilst anticipating and providing for its ultimate division, created for Yorkshire the See of Beverley, with <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the entire county then known to the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> as the Yorkshire District. As that of Lancashire, this vicariate had been made in 1840 by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> out of a portion of the original Northern District, first established by <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>, in 1688.

<p>Dr. John Briggs, President of <a href="../cathen/04578a.htm">St. Cuthbert's</a> College, Durham (1832-36), and last <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of this extensive territory, which included seven counties of the North of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and the isle of Man, was, in 1833, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Trachis <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus</a></em>, and coadjutor of the Northern District, to which he succeeded in 1836. In 1839 he returned the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> within his vicariate as about 180,000, of whom only 13,000 were in Yorkshire. Having in 1840 been appointed to the Yorkshire District, Dr. Briggs, by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> approved by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 23 Sept., 1830, was translated from Trachis to Beverley, which see he resigned, 7 Nov., 1860. He died at <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, 4 Jan., 1861. Eventually senior <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the restored <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, his episcopate was one long, heroic struggle to provide <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and churches for an ever-growing destitute <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population&mdash;the outcome of many years of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> immigration. So early as 1838, Bishop Briggs deplored that great numbers of his people were without <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, without <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and without <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for their children; of whom, in 1845, he stated that, in Yorkshire alone, no less than 3000 were receiving no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> whatsoever&mdash;a class, ten years later, known to have numbered, throughout <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, 120,000.

<p>Dr. Briggs was succeeded in the See of Beverley by Dr. Robert Cornthwaite, canon of <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham and Newcastle</a>, and formerly <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the English College, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1851-57). He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a>, 10 Nov., 1861. Subsequently, Dr. Cornthwaite obtained from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 20 Dec., 1878, though not published until 6 Feb., 1879, dividing the <a href="../cathen/02540b.htm">Diocese of Beverley</a> into those of Leeds and Middlesbrough &mdash; that of Leeds lying, for the most part, to the south of a line running east and west through the County of Yorkshire, marked by the courses of the Humber, the Ouse, and the Ure, but embracing also a small portion of the county north of the Ouse included within the parliamentary division of the West Riding. Of the 152 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Beverley (who in 1850 had numbered 69) 98 were transferred to Leeds; of its 123 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> (which twenty-nine years before were 61) Beverley surrendered to Leeds 85; whilst of its 141 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (in 1850 in all 31) 105 were transferred to the larger of the two new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, carrying with them more than four-fifths of the 15,677 children formerly in attendance within the <a href="../cathen/02540b.htm">Diocese of Beverley</a>.

<p>Dr. Cornthwaite having petitioned, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for assistance, he received as coadjutor Dr. William Gordon, a member of the Leeds Chapter, and afterwards his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. The last <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Dr. Briggs in 1859, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01687c.htm">Arcadiopolis</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus</a>, and coadjutor of Leeds <em>cum jure successionis</em>, 24 Feb., 1890, to which see he succeeded upon the death of his predecessor, 16 June, 1890. His coadjutor, Dr. Joseph Robert Cowgill, was appointed fifteen years later <em>cum jure succesionis</em>. At that time financial agent of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and canon of the Chapter, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11240b.htm">Olenus</a> <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus</a></em>, 30 Nov., 1905.

<p>With an estimated <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of about 106,000, mostly operatives, the Diocese of Leeds now contains 138 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, served by 163 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, of whom 36 are members of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and congregations. Of its 150 elementary and other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 70 are taught by religious. Among other memorials of Dr. Cornthwaite's episcopate, besides 39 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and its <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Leeds, the diocese possesses houses of the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, for the aged and infirm, at Sheffield and Leeds; industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys and girls at Shibden and Sheffield; St. Mary's Orphanage for Girls and St. Vincent's Working Boys' Home, at Leeds; and, at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> Spa, St. John's Institution for the Deaf and Dumb&mdash;one of the largest of its kind, and in efficiency second to none in the kingdom. During Dr. Gordon's government of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, much-needed secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys have been established at Leeds and Bradford; of these, St. Michael's College, Leeds, being erected 1908-1909 at a cost of upwards of &#163;18,000. Provision has also been made, during this period, for the higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of girls at Sheffield, Leeds, and Bradford-- the Leeds Centre and Teachers' Training College, under the care of the <a href="../cathen/11128b.htm">Sisters of Notre Dame (Namur)</a>, representing an outlay of about &#163;15,000.

<p>Among the 35 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, within the Diocese of Leeds, special interest attaches to the seventeenth-century Bar Convent, of the <a href="../cathen/08054a.htm">Institute of Mary</a>, in <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, rich in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> associations and in <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyrs</a>. Of the numerous churches more recently built, particular mention should be made of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/01538a.htm">St. Anne</a>, and erected at Leeds, in 1902-04, from the designs of J.H. Eastwood, A.R.I.B.A., a small but unique example of "developed Gothic"; and, among the churches of earlier date architecturally remarkable, St. Mary's, Sheffield (1850) and St. Mary's, Leeds. (1857), are both fine examples of the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> revival of the last century. And with these may be associated St. Edward's, Clifford (1850), a small church in the Norman style, worthy of the ages of Faith, erected principally through the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of descendants of the Venerable Ralph Grimston, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> under Elizabeth at <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, in 1598.
