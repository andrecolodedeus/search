<h1>Legacies</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>Legata</em>).
<h2 id="section1">Definition</h2>

<p>In its most restricted sense, by a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> legacy or bequest (<em>legatum pium</em>) is understood, the assigning, by a last will, of a particular thing forming part of an estate, to a church or an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institution. It differs from a testament in favour of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> works (<em>testamentum ad pias causas</em>) in this, that in a testament the favoured institution is made the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heir of the testator, continuing as it were his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Moreover, a testament deals with the whole <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, the patrimony of the testator. It results from this that a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> legacy or bequest need not necessarily be made the body of a will; it can be inserted in a codicil. A <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequest differs likewise from a "donatio mortis causa", which is a contract, whereas the bequest is made by a unilateral act. It is distinguished, finally, from a foundation, which can be made during life as well as by provision in a will, and which always imposes on the favoured establishment <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>, either perpetual or of fairly long duration. A legacy may be but is not necessarily a foundation.
<h2 id="section2">Right of the Church to receive legacies</h2>

<p>Natural law, no less than Divine, ordains that the will of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, bequeathing part of their wealth to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be respected (Instruction of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, 1807, in "Collectanea S.C. de P. F.", I, Rome, 1907, n. 689). The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was established by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and perfect <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, since its object is to lead men to their last end, consequently, it can uphold its right to acquire all the means <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to realize the object for which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> instituted it. Being an external and visible <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, it must be able to dispose of temporal goods for the needs of Divine service, the support of its <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, the propagation of the Faith, the care of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, etc. Therefore, it may acquire these goods by all legitimate means, and among these means are included <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequests or legacies. Natural right demands that the goods of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> dying intestate should pass to their children, and in many cases it is a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> for <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to leave part of their patrimony to their children; canon law recognizes and approves of this <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. But there is no serious reason for depriving <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to dispose by will, for a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> purpose, of those goods that are at their free disposal as long as they are alive. While profitable to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequests are not less so to the donors "for the salvation of their souls", in the words of the usual testamentary formula of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> (Fournier, "Les officialit&eacute;s au moyen &acirc;ge", Paris, 1880, p. 87). The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXVI, Decr. de Purgatorio) declares that <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> foundations are a means of relieving the sufferings of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>. The First <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/07117b.htm">Halifax</a> applies to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequests those words of the Gospel: "Make unto you friends of the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">Mammon</a> of iniquity; that when you shall fail, they may receive you into everlasting dwellings" (Luke xvi, 9; "Collectio Lacensis", III, Freiburg, 1875, 746). Pious bequests are a means by which generous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> can continue, after their decease, their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, and provide for the future of the institutions that they have founded or enriched. Those who have omitted during life to fulfill the precept of charity can find therein a way of repairing their negligence ("First Provincial Council of Westminster", 1852, XXV, II; "Collectio Lacensis", III, 942). Those, finally, who, owing to daily cares and anxieties, found it impossible to be bountiful during life, may yet, if only at the hour of death, cooperate in the relief of the unfortunate, and assure their neighbour the spiritual advantages of Divine service.
<h2 id="section3">History</h2>

<p>The charity of the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> led them to despoil themselves while alive of their superfluous goods; consequently, mention is rarely made of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> legacies before the time of Constantine. After that emperor's conversion they became more prominent, especially after the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the year 321 allowed churches to receive all kinds of legacies, and granted them the "factio testamenti passiva", i.e. the right of being made heirs (Theodosian Code, XVI, II, lit. iv). Authors are not agreed on the import of a law of <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> dated June, 390, forbidding <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, who were <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and had children, to dispose of their goods in favour of churches or the poor (ibid. xxvii). Many authors consider it an important restriction of the right recognized by Constantine as belonging to the churches (Fourneret, "Les biens d'&Eacute;glise apres les &eacute;dits de pacification; Ressources dont l'&Eacute;glise disposa pour reconstruire son patrimoine", Paris, 1902, p. 84). Others see in it only a means of protecting, against the abuse of maternal power, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the children to the succession of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> (Knecht, "System des Justinianischen Kirchenverm&ouml;gensrechtes", Stuttgart, 1905, 75-76). In any case, Emperor Marcian restored the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the churches in 485 (Justinian Code, I, II, xiii). Among the Teutonic peoples, testamentary liberalities properly so-called seem to have been unknown, but they had an arrangement resembling the "donatio mortis causa" of the Romans, i.e., the "cessiones post obitum", donations which the donor bound himself not to retract, but which took effect only on his death.



<p>In virtue of the Teutonic principle of the <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> of law, the inhabitants whom the Teutons found settled in the old provinces of the empire they conquered could continue to follow the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>. In this way the power to bequeath to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> establishments was introduced among the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a>, <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>, and Bavarians, while in Gaul <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequests were tolerated in fact before being authorized by law (Loening, "Geschichte des deutschen Kirchenrechts", II, <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, 1878, 655). Several <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> period even declare the validity of testaments, especially those of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, in which the formalities prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> had not been observed (Bondroit, "De capacitate possidendi Ecclesi&aelig; &aelig;tate merovingica", Louvain, 1900, 87 and 105). (See <a href="../cathen/05116a.htm">DONATIONS</a>.)

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> retained in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the right of supervising the execution of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequests, which had been recognized by the Justinian Code (I, III, xlv). This right was even extended, and in several regions the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunal judged of the validity of wills and supervised their execution (Fournier, op. cit., 87; Friedberg, "De finium inter Ecclesiam et Civitatem regundorum judicio quid medii &aelig;vi doctores statuerint", Leipzig, 1861, 124). It was in virtue of this right that <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> determined the conditions for the validity of wills in non-ecclesiastical matters (c. x., "De testamentis et ultimis voluntatibus", X; III, xxvi. See Wernz, "Jus Decretalium", III, Rome, 1901, 309). This same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, following the example of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/08545a.htm">ecclesiastical judge</a> was to decide the validity of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequests not in accordance with the provisions of the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> but with the decrees of canon law (cc. iv, xi, "De testamentis et ultimis voluntatibus", X, III, xxvi).

<p>The practice of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequests was so common in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> that it seemed improbable that any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> would have dispensed himself from it. This was the origin of the right of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in certain places, particularly in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, to dispose, in favour of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> objects, of part of the goods of an intestate deceased <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> (Fournier, op. cit., 89). The generosity of the faithful built and endowed those wonders of art, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and churches as well as the many <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> that were the glory of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Church, and that the official charity of the State has succeeded neither in rivalling nor in replacing. It was not until the close of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval period</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> began to restrict the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> by religious <a href="../cathen/10579a.htm">mortmain</a>. In modern times, even in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries, wills were withdrawn from the judicial authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> finally deprived the latter of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to adjudicate even on testamentary questions relating to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequests.
<h2 id="section4">Actual canonical legislation</h2>

<p>The Church reserves to itself, even now, an exclusive authority in the matter of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> wills and legacies; it has its own legislation, the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> modified on several points by canon law, and its <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunals to examine the questions connected therewith.

<p>(1) Besides <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who by <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> or in virtue of the enactments of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> are incapable of making a will, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> refuses to accept the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequests of <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usurers</a> (c. ii, De usuris, in VI&#176;, V, 5), of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and their accomplices (c. xiii, De hereticis, X, V, 7), and of those who are guilty of attacks on the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> (c. v, De p&oelig;nis, in VI&#176;, V, 9). In practice, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> refuses at the present time, to accept the bequests of sinners who die impenitent, and especially of <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usurers</a>, in order not to be enriched by their ill-gotten goods (Santi, "Pr&aelig;lectiones juris canonici", III, Rome, 1898, 224-25). Religious who make solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of profession are permitted to make wills only during the two months preceding their solemn profession; other religious must conform to the rules of their congregation. The rules (<em>norm&oelig;</em>) drawn up by the Congregation of Bishops and Regulars for the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of institutes bound by simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> (Rome, 1901) forbid the making of wills after <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> without the permission of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> or, in case of urgency, without the authorization of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or the superiors (Art. 120 and 122. See Vermeersch, "De religiosis", I, <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, 1902, 148).

<p>(2) It is not alone bequests made to churches that enjoy the prerogatives established by canon law, but also those made to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, and all institutions, whether purely religious or of a charitable character subject to the direction of religious authorities. However, certain <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, either because they practise poverty in a stricter manner, or in virtue of their constitution, have only a restricted right to acquire <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> by legacy or will (Santi, op. cit., III, 238-9; Wernz, op. cit., III, 322).

<p>(3) The heirs of the testator are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to execute <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequests, even if they have not been made in accordance with the formalities prescribed under penalty of nullity by the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, provided canon law considers them to have been made validly. The State has an incontestable right to prescribe the formalities requisite for the validity of wills in all matters falling within its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> legacies and bequests for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> purposes are under the exclusive control of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This principle was clearly enunciated by <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretal</a> "Relatum" (c. xi, De testamentis et ultimis voluntatibus, X, III, xxvi). It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> this <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretal</a> was addressed to the judges of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Velletri</a>, a town in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, but its force cannot be restricted solely to the territory under the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and the insertion of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretal</a> in the "Corpus Juris", or general law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, deprives the objection of all force. It has been urged that a contrary custom had abrogated this canonical enactment, and that, moreover, only natural equity and the favour shown by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequests have caused <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> legacies made with a neglect of solemn formalities to be considered valid. The constant practice of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> proves that this argument is not conclusive. On 10 January, 1901, the Sacred Penitentiaria declared that, as a general rule, it considers valid and binding in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequests which the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> declares void on account of the omission of extrinsic formalities prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. Nevertheless, in such a case the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> are generally disposed to come to terms with the heirs ("Acta Sancti&aelig; Sedis", XXXIV, Rome, 1902, 384). (See, in the same sense, the decrees of the S. C. C. "in caus. Arimin.", 13 September, 1854; "in caus. Hortana", 29 February, 1855; and reply of the Penitentiaria, 23 June, 1844.)

<p>According to the common opinion of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, for a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequest to be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> it suffices that the wish of the testator be well established, e.g. by a holograph or a writing merely signed by the testator, by a verbal declaration made to the heir himself or before two witnesses (a single testimony other than that of the heir would be insufficient). If it be urged that the testator has revoked his bequest, the fact must be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> The Congregation of the Council decided, 16 March, 1900, that a writing containing erasures, which is only a draft of a will, is not a sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the testator wished to revoke a previous will ("Acta Sanct&aelig; Sedis", XXXII, Rome, 1900-01, 202). The contrary opinion is now held only by a few authorities (Carriere, "De contractibus", n. 586, Louvain, 1846; D'Annibale, "Summula theologi&aelig; moralis", II n 339, Rome, 1892; Boudinhon in "Le Canoniste contemporain", XXIV, Paris, 1901, 734). By <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, if a testator knowingly bequeathes a thing not in his possession, it was equivalent to ordering the heir to purchase the thing for the legatee or, if that were impossible, to give him its value. A <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory I</a> seems to overrule this decision (c. v. De testamentis et ultimis voluntatibus, X, III, xxvi). But it may be replied that this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, while admitting the principle of the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, intended only to declare that natural equity will often dispense the heir from carrying out the wish of the testator in the matter (Santi, op. cit., III, 242--245). This provision of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> being not generally known in our day, it is lawful to presume that the testator made a mistake, and that the bequest is therefore void.

<p>(4) The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> approved the provision of the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> prohibiting the testator from disposing of the "pars legitima" which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> ordered to be preserved to the heirs, this being conformable to <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. Although in our modern codes the "pars legitima" is greater than it was in the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, it may be presumed that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> recognizes the ruling of our codes in the matter. All bequests exceeding the amount which the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> allows to be disposed of freely by the testator may therefore be reduced. The provisions of the Corpus Juris (cc. xiv, xv, xx, De testamentis et ultimis voluntatibus, X, III, xxvi) granting the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the "portio canonica"&mdash;i.e. the quarter of all <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequests not affected by the testator to a definite purpose&mdash;are no longer in force. (5) The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can compel the heirs or the executors to fulfil the last wishes of the deceased in the matter of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequests (c. ii, v, xix, "De testamentis et ultimis voluntatibus", X, III, xxvi; Council of Trent, Sess. xxii, "De reformatione", c. viii). He is also the judge of the first instance in testamentary cases submitted to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunals. In virtue of this he has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to interpret the terms of the will, but any change properly so called of the wishes of the deceased is reserved we think, to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, which can make such change only for grave reasons (c. ii, "De religiosis domibus III, 11, in "Clem."). The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess, XXII, De reformatione, c. vi) recognizes in <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> only the right of executing a change in the will made by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; this, however, does not prevent a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from applying to another object, a legacy left for a definite purpose which can no longer be executed in accordance with the wish of the testator. <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> grants <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> the right of making changes in the will of a testator, in countries where communication with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is very difficult, and in cases where it is impossible to carry out the testator's wish; but it <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliges</a> them in each case to obtain a subsequent approval of their act by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (Instruction of 1807, in "Collectanea", I, n. 689). The Constitution "Romanos pontifices" of 8 May, 1881, lays down certain rules concerning the interpretation of the terms of a last will (" Acta et decreta concilii plenarii Baltimorensis III", <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 1886, 46, 225-- 227).
<h2 id="section5">Wills of ecclesiastics</h2>

<p>While canon law has never forbidden <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> to dispose freely of their own private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, it has always maintained the principle that the superfluous revenues derived from <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> ought to be devoted to religious or charitable purposes. If they have not been so disposed of during his lifetime by the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who was in receipt of them, after his death they should be distributed either as canonical legislation enacts or as a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequest. During the first centuries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> alone had the administration of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, measures were taken by the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> to prevent its dissipation by the heirs of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Justinian forbade <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to dispose of the goods acquired by them after their promotion to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>, excepting, of course, their own patrimonial estate (Novell&aelig;, CXXXI, c. xiii). The Third <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> (397) had already legislated in a similar sense with regard to ecelesiastics (Bruns, "Canones apostolorum et conciliorum veterum selecti", I, <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1839, 134). Moreover, the Theodosian Code assigned to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the goods of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> dying intestate, and not leaving children or relatives (V, III, lib. i). These regulations were confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and the councils (see Decretum Gratiani, II, c. Xii, q. 5, "An liceat clericis testamenta conficere"). But, as early as the sixth century, we learn from the decrees of councils that abuses had already crept in: <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and even <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were attempting to seize <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> on the death of their confreres (Decret. Gratian, loc. cit., q. 2); later, it was the turn of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>; emperors, princes, lawyers, and patrons claimed a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to the spoils (<em>Jus spolii</em> or <em>exuviarum</em>).

<p>To remedy this state of affairs, the reforming <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of the eleventh and twelfth centuries forced the emperors to renounce explicitly their right to the spoils, and the Third Council of Lateran (1179) as well as <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> made certain enactments regarding the estates of ecelesiastics; the latter were free to dispose of their own patrimony, the "peculium patrimoniale" as canonists call it, i.e., all goods which <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> acquired by inheritance, will, or any kind of contract soever, but independently of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> character. They might dispose likewise of the "peculium industriale" or "quasi patrimioniale", i.e. the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> acquired by their own personal activity. To this was likened the "peculium parsimoniale", or that portion of the revenues coming from <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>, which the beneficiary might reasonably have spent on himself, but which he economized (Santi, op. cit., III, 210). But he was forbidden to dispose of the "peculium beneficiale", the superfluous revenue of the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> he held, and which he did not distribute in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> during his life. In principle this was to pass to the church in which the ecclesiastic held the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. However, <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> does not blame the custom, where it exists, of bequeathing some part of this "peculium" to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, or to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions, or even, as a reward for services rendered, to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, whether relatives or not, who have been in the service of the deceased cleric (cc. vii, viii, ix, xii, De testamentis et ultimis voluntatibus, X,III, xxvi).

<p>It does not follow, of course, that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was observed; the "spolium" remained customary among ecelesiastics, especially <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, chapters, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (c. xl, "De electione in VI&#176;, 6; c. ix, "De officio ordinarii" in VI&#176;, I, 16 c i De excessibus pr&aelig;latorum in Clem. V, vi) The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> themselves saw in it a means of increasing their revenues. As early as the fourteenth century they reserved to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> that portion of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> which the latter could not dispose of freely, with certain exceptions. These fiscal measures reached their highest limits during the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>. They met with vigorous opposition in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where the kings refused to admit the right of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and also in the councils of the fifteenth century. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> maintained their claims for a long time (see the Constitution of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> "Grave nobis", 26 May, 1560 in "Bullarum amplissima collectio", ed. Cocquelines, IV, ii, 18; that of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> "Romani pontificis providentia", 30 August, 1587, Ibidem, 394; and of <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>, "Officii", 21 January, 1577, Ibidem, IV, iii, 330). On 19 June, 1817, <a href="../cathen/12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a> declared that <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> was entitled to all revenue of the "spolium" (Collectanea, I, n. 724). On the other hand, even when the legislation of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> was introduced, it was not always enforced in the same way; in some places the ecclesiastics could dispose of their "peculium beneficiale" in favour of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> purposes; in others they were granted full testamentary liberty, provided they made a legacy in favour of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> objects, or else paid a certain sum to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who allowed them to make the will. These practices, together with the difficulty of distinguishing, in the inheritance of an ecclesiastic, the amount of the "patrimonium beneficiale", eventually left <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> testamentary freedom.

<p>However, the canonical legislation is yet substantially unchanged; <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> are even now <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to bequeath for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> purposes the superfluous part of the revenues from their <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> which they have not distributed during their life. This principle, recalled by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXV, De reformatione, c. i), is reasserted in most provincial councils of the nineteenth century. It is commonly admitted that it imposes no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but merely one based on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> precept (Santi, op. cit., III, 211; Wernz, op. cit., III, 210--11). This <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> does not exist in countries where there are no <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, or where <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> strictly so called are <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notoriously</a> insufficient for the support of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who enjoy them. Under these circumstances, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> bequests are earnestly recommended to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, but they are never <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. For the special rules regulating the wills of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, see Santi, op. cit., III, 227--34. The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> imposed on <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, needless to say, are binding on their heirs in case they die intestate. Sometimes this matter is decided by local custom. The Provincial Councils of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1858) and of Prague (1860) <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> that the estate of an ecclesiastic deceased intestate is to be divided into three parts: one for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, one for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and the third for the relatives of the deceased. If the deceased was not possessed of any <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>, only one-third of the estate is subject to the above rule, and that is to be distributed among the needy, but should the heirs of the deceased belong to that class, said portion may be given to them.
