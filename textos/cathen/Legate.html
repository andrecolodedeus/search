<h1>Legate</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>legare</em>, to send).

<p>Legate, in its broad signification, means that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is sent by another for some representative office. In the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> sense it means one whom the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sends to sovereigns or governments or only to the members of the episcopate and faithful of a country, as his representative, to treat of church matters or even on a mission of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Hence the legate differs from the delegate, taking this term in a strictly juridical sense, since the delegate is one to whom the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> entrusts an affair or many affairs to be treated through delegated <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and often in questions of litigation, whereas the legate goes with ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over a whole country or nation. The canon law treats of delegates of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, <em>delegati Sedis Apostolic&aelig;</em> (Decret., lib. I, tit. xxix), and in this sense even <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, in certain cases determined by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. V, cap. i, De Ref., etc.), may act as delegates of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Nevertheless, as will be seen later, according to the present <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a>, a delegate, inasmuch as he is sent to represent the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in some particular country, really fills the office of a legate. Since the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of a legate is ordinary, he does not cease to be legate even at the death of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> who appointed him, and even if he arrived at his post after the death of that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, by virtue of his primacy of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to send legates to provide for the unity of Faith and for <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, and to choose them at will. Though self-evident, this authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has been contested from a very early period. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> (1073-85) reproved the claims of those who wished to have only Romans as legates and not representatives from other countries. Paschal II (1099-1118), in a letter to Henry I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, grievously deplores the vexations inflicted on the pontifical. legate, and maintains the right of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to send such representatives. <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> (1316-34) declares unreasonable and contrary to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the refusal to admit a papal legate without the approval of the sovereign. And there are not wanting writers who denied, some wholly, others in part, such a right on the part of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, e.g. Marc' Antonio de Dominis, Richer, <a href="../cathen/07463a.htm">Febronius</a>, Eybel, and others. This <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> claim was upheld in the eighteenth century by four <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, those of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and Salzburg, to whom <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> made the famous reply of 14 November, 1789, in which we read that one of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of primacy of St. Peter is that "By virtue of his Apostolic prerogative, while providing for the care of all the lambs and the sheep confided to him, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> discharges his Apostolic <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> also by delegating <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> for a time or permanently as may seem best, to go into distant places where he cannot go and to take his place and exercise such <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> as he himself, if present, would exercise." Worthy of attention also are the diplomatical note of <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Cardinal Consalvi</a> to the Spanish Government (9 January, 1802), which treats of the character of the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Apostolic nuncio</a>, and the letter of Cardinal Jacobii (15 April, 1885) to the same Government. The <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, in stating the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> concerning the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (Sess. IV, cap. iii), condemned implicitly the said <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. The Constitution <a href="../cathen/01645a.htm">"Apostolic&aelig; Sedis"</a>, moreover, contains (no. 5) an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> reserved <em>speciali modo</em> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> against those who harm, expel, or unlawfully detain legates or <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a>.
<h2>Historical development and division</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> have made use of this right from the earliest ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The first example was the sending by Sylvester I of legates to the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (325); afterwards those sent to the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> (345); and those sent by Zosimus I to Africa (418), to settle certain <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters. In the fourth century we find the first example of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> representative sent in an official character, i.e. the <em>apocrisiarius</em> (q.v.), or <em>responsalis</em>. According to <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar of Reims</a>, the apocrisiarius dates back to. the time of Constantine, but according to <a href="../cathen/09637b.htm">De Marca</a> (De Ord. Palatii, cap. xiii), the office dates from the Council of Colchis (451). From the letters of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory I</a>, himself an apocrisiarius, and from a letter of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a> to Julianus of Cos, whom he appointed apocrisiarius, can be <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> the powers of this officer and his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, i.e. to look after the observance of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, to resist the spread of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and to defend the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. For three centuries such a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> intermediary existed at the Byzantine Court. During the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast troubles</a> of the eighth century this office disappeared, but was temporarily revived in the West when the empire was restored by <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a> (795-816). Finally, however, the necessity and frequency of extraordinary legations, the weakening and later division of the empire among the successors of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, rendered useless and almost impossible the presence of Apostolic legates at the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> court.


<h3><em>Legati nati</em></h3>

<p>Almost contemporaneously with the apocrisiarius, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> established in the fourth century another class of legates, of a purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> character, known eventually as <em>legati nati</em>, or perpetual legates. They may be regarded as originating from the "Apostolic vicars" established by Popes Damasus I (366-84) and Siricius (384-99). To provide more expeditiously for <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> and to facilitate the dispatch of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> deemed it opportune to attach to certain sees (and first to Thessalonica) the title and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of Apostolic vicar. The same title and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> were conferred by later <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> on other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who successively occupied those sees came to be known as legati nati, inasmuch as by their election to the said sees they became <em>ipso facto</em> Apostolic legates, that office being attached to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> itself. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> legati nati became very numerous; in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> those of Arles (545), Sens (876), Lyons (1097); in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> those of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a> (517), Seville (520), Toledo (1088); in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> those of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> (969), Salzburg (973); in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> that of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>; in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> that of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, etc. In the beginning the faculties of legati nati were very ample, namely, the right of visiting the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the province, of examining the status of candidates for <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, of consecrating the metropolitan, etc.; eventually, however, these faculties were much lessened, and in the eleventh century the legati nati practically ceased to exist. In our day the sees to which was annexed such privilege have no longer any extraordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, though some enjoy an honorary distinction; the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, for example, may wear the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalatial</a> purple, even in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.
<h3><em>Legati missi</em></h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> conditions of the tenth and eleventh centuries were responsible for the cessation of the office of legati nati. Ecclesiastical life was then in many ways and places ill-regulated, and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> very lax; the legati nati <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> incapable of remedying these evils, either because some times times their own conduct was not exemplary or because they were negligent in the discharge of their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to combat these abuses by choosing and sending into various countries <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who could be depended upon to secure the desired results (Luxardo, "Das p&auml;pstliche Vordekretalen-Gesandschaftsrecht", 1878). Thus came into existence the <em>legati missi</em>, or special envoys. Later all those whom the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> sent on a special mission were called legati missi, even those who were to preside at some solemn <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, e.g. a royal <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> or marriage; those appointed to meet an emperor or a sovereign visiting <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, etc. This title was also given to those who were chosen to rule some provinces of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>, e.g. the legate of Bologna, of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, etc.
<h3><em>Legati a latere</em></h3>

<p>About the same time another form of legation was established, which became and is the highest, i.e. the <em>legati a latere</em>. The legate a latere is always a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and this name arises from the fact that a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, being a member of the senate of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, is considered as an intimate, one attached to the very side of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a>. Other authorities derive this title from the custom of receiving the insignia and the office in the presence, or at the side, of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Such legates are sent on missions of the greatest importance, e.g. the legate a latere sent to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Cardinal Giovanni Battista Caprara, to execute the famous <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a>. The last legate a latere was also sent to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1856, in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Cardinal Patrizi, to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> the Prince Imperial. The "Diario di Roma" of that year gives all the particulars of the proclamation of the appointment in a consistory of 27 August, and of the ceremonies which accompanied the departure of the legate. The same Cardinal Patrizi on that occasion was deputed to present the <a href="../cathen/06629a.htm">Golden Rose</a> to the Empress Eug&eacute;nie. The powers of the legate a latere are of the most ample character, both in matters of litigation and favours. He journeys with an imposing suite; immediately after leaving <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the cross is borne before him, and in his presence not even <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> have the right that their cross should precede them; <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> cannot give episcopal <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> without his consent. According to the present usage, however, a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> sent on a mission does not always bear the title of legate a latere, as in the case of a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> sent by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to represent him at some religious gathering, like the Eucharistic Congresses of Westminster, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> clearly defined the powers of legates missi and legates a latere. Since the latter were sent only for very important matters, the custom of sending legati missi became more frequent.
<h3>Nuncios</h3>

<p>In the thirteenth century legati missi came to be known as <em>nuncios</em>, by which name they are yet called. After the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a> were established permanently in various countries. Besides an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> mission, they have also a diplomatic character, having been from their origin accredited to courts or governments. Their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is ordinary, but it is customary at present to grant them special faculties, according to the needs of the country to which they are sent; such faculties are conveyed in a special <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>. They are also given credential letters to be presented to the ruler of the country, and particular instructions in writing. The <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a> are usually titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>; occasionally, however, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of residential sees are appointed to the office. Some <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a> are of the first and some of the second class, the only difference between them being that, at the end of their mission, those of the first class are usually promoted to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>. <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> have <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a> of the first class. <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> was also of this class, but, on account of the rupture of diplomatic relations between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the Vatican which took place in 1907, it has at present no representative of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> have <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a> of the second class. There is no specified period for the duration of the term of a <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio's</a> office; it depends on circumstances and the will of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.
<h3>Internuncios</h3>

<p>According to the present discipline, there are also internuncios, who in the order of pontifical diplomacy follow immediately after <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a>. These also are frequently titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, always have a diplomatic character, and are sent to governments of less importance. They are equivalent to <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the second class, have the same faculties as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a>, and are furnished with similar credentials and instructions. At present there are internuncios in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentina</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>. In <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, however, because of the exclusion of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> from the Peace Conference of 1899, the internuncio, Monsignor Tarnassi, was recalled, and now there is only a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> charg&eacute; d'affaires. The internuncio of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> is also accredited to the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg.
<h3>Apostolic delegates and envoys extraordinary</h3>

<p>Actually there are also <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> representatives known as Apostolic delegates and envoys extraordinary. Apostolic delegates, strictly speaking, are always <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> in character, and are usually sent by the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a> to missionary countries. However, the pontifical secretariate of state is accustomed to send Apostolic delegates purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> in character to countries which have not diplomatic relations with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; at the same time when sending an Apostolic delegate to a country which has diplomatic relations with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> there is added the title of envoy extraordinary, by which title he is accredited to the Government. Such are the Apostolic delegates and envoys extraordinary to South America, e.g. to <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">Colombia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, <a href="../cathen/02627a.htm">Bolivia</a>, <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>, <a href="../cathen/04417d.htm">Costa Rica</a>, etc. Other Apostolic delegates, purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> in character, are those sent to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, Mexico, <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, <a href="../cathen/04558c.htm">Cuba</a>, and Porto Rico. The Apostolic delegation to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> deserves special mention. First, on account of its importance it is practically equivalent to a nunciature of the first class, as may be inferred from the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> of 6 January, 1895, addressed by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, which declares:

<blockquote><p>When the Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> had concluded its labours, the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> still remained of putting, so to speak, a proper and becoming crown upon the work. This we perceived could scarcely be done in a more fitting manner than through the due establishment by the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> of an American legation. Accordingly, as you are well aware, we have done this. By this action, as we have elsewhere intimated, we wished, first of all, to certify that in our judgment and affection America occupied the same place and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as other states, however powerful and imperial.</p></blockquote>

<p>Moreover, from the beginning all the incumbents of this office have been elevated to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>. Second, the Apostolic delegation to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> has the power to decide appeals by definitive sentence; in other words it is a tribunal of third instance, and from its decision there is regularly no appeal to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. This power, although granted from the beginning, has been recently confirmed by a declaration of the Consistorial Congregation to an inquiry of the Apostolic delegate at Washington, as to whether the original <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> grant of authority was to be continued, in view of the transfer of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (Sapienti Consilio, 4 November, 1908). The said reply, given 8 May, 1909, establishes once for all that the parties are free to appeal from a sentence of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> or <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> curia directly to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> or to the delegation, but, an appeal once made to the delegation, the sentence pronounced by the delegate is to be considered definitive.

<p>The Delegation of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was established by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 24 January, 1893. The first delegate was <a href="../cathen/13486a.htm">Monsignor Francesco Satolli</a>, who in 1892 had been selected to represent the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> at the World's Fair in <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> commissioner. He was born at Marsciano, <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Archdiocese of Perugia</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, in 1839; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 8 Jan., 1910. Acknowledged as one of the leading <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the day, he was appointed by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> a professor in the most famous <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> college and Roman <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. He was later made president of the Academy of Noble Ecclesiastics in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1886), and titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09181b.htm">Lepanto</a> (1888); promoted to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> 29 November, 1896, he received the <a href="../cathen/02577a.htm">biretta</a> in February, 1896, at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, from Cardinal Gibbons. <a href="../cathen/13486a.htm">Cardinal Satolli</a> was succeeded 27 Aug., 1896, by Monsignor Sebastian Martinelli, an Augustinian. Born in August, 1848, he entered the Augustinian Order in 1863 and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1874. He occupied many prominent positions in his order, and was elected prior general for the second term in 1895. While in Nice he was appointed Apostolic Delegate to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and created <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Ephesus in August, 1996. He was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> 15 April, 1901, and received the <a href="../cathen/02577a.htm">biretta</a> 9 May of that year, in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, from Cardinal Gibbons. The present Apostolic delegate (1909), Monsignor Diomede Falconio, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, succeeded Cardinal Martinelli 30 September, 1902, and took possession on 21 November, 1902. he was born 20 September, 1842, at Pescocostanzo in the Abruzzi, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and entered the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> 2 September, 1860. On the completion of his studies he was sent as missionary to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> to the mother-house of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at Alleghany, New York, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Bishop Timon of <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, 4 January, 1S66. After filling several important positions, he was sent, November, 1871, to <a href="../cathen/10782a.htm">Newfoundland</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and secretary and chancellor to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He left Harbor Grace in 1882, and in 1883 returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In 1889 he was chosen procurator-general of his order, and in July, 1892, was <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08732a.htm">Lacedonia</a>. A few years later, he was promoted to the <a href="../cathen/01101a.htm">archiepiscopal See of Acerenza and Matera</a> in Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Monsignor Falconio was appointed first permanent Apostolic Delegate to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, 3 August, 1899, and on 30 September, 1902 was nominated Apostolic Delegate to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is also accustomed, according to circumstances, to send so-called Apostolic vicars, who may be either <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> or simply members of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities. Such representatives have always an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> mission only, and are sent to examine the status of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> or <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, or some religious body.

<p>To nunciatures and Apostolic delegations is attached a staff composed of an auditor and a secretary. They are nominated by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and are either of the first or second class. Sometimes the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> sends also to nunciatures a counsellor and an attach&eacute;. In the absence of <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> or delegate the auditor takes his place with the title of charg&eacute; d'affaires.

<p>Among the envoys of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> should be mentioned also the Apostolic ablegate and the bearer of the <a href="../cathen/06629a.htm">Golden Rose</a>. The Apostolic ablegate is generally a Roman <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> or private chamberlain, sent to bear the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> <a href="../cathen/02577a.htm">biretta</a> to a new <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> who is absent from the residence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He is accompanied by a member of the Noble Guard, who carries the <a href="../cathen/15765b.htm">zucchetto</a>, and by a private secretary. The <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of conferring the <a href="../cathen/02577a.htm">biretta</a> is performed either by the head of the State, if in diplomatic relation with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, or by the highest ecclesiastical dignitary in the country. The bearer of the <a href="../cathen/06629a.htm">Golden Rose</a> is appointed to carry the <a href="../cathen/06629a.htm">Golden Rose</a> (blessed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on L&aelig;tare Sunday of each year) to sovereigns or to distinguished <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> or to some famous church. In 1895 this office was established permanently.
<h2>Right of precedence of the representatives of the Holy See</h2>

<p>The question of precedence among the various diplomatic representatives to foreign countries was treated at the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1815, and it was decided that it always appertains to the representatives of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a> are by right and in fact deans of the diplomatic body. Some objections were afterwards made, especially by <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and Sweden, as to the precedence of Apostolic delegates and internuncios, these not being mentioned in the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>; however, it ended in their practical recognition as included in the decision of said congress.
