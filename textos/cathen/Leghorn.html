<h1>Leghorn</h1>  

<p>(LIBURNENSIS.)

<p>Suffragan of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. Leghorn (<a href="../cathen/08245a.htm">Italian</a> <em>Livorno</em>), in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, is the capital of the smallest of the provinces of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The city is situated on marshy ground, and is in consequence intersected by many canals, hence it has been called "Little <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>". A larger canal puts it in communication with <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. It has two ports, the old, or <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a>, port, and the new port constructed in 1854. In former times Leghorn was the most important port in the Grand Duchy of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>; even now it is outranked only by <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>.

<p>Among its numerous teaching establishments are a naval academy, and an observatory erected in 1881. The public <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> is important, and the prehistoric museum contains many Etruscan and Roman antiquities. The town likewise possesses a gallery of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, and its archives have an historical interest. Among the more important industries are shipbuilding, ironworks, and trade in alabaster and coral. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> dates from the sixteenth century; there are also churches belonging to the Greek, the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Rites. The <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">Synagogue</a> (1603) is second only to that at <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>. The royal palace was erected by Cosimo I. Of note also are the Torre del Marzocco, now used as a signal station, and the Torre della Meloria, near which, in 1241, the <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a> surprised and defeated the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> fleet on its way to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were going to the council summoned against <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>.

<p>Among the ancients Leghorn was known as <em>Portus Liburni</em>, and was of small importance until the sixteenth century. It belonged to the <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a>, and was captured from them by the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a>. In 1421 the Florentines bought it for 100,000 florins, and thus Leghorn came to be the main outlet for Florentine commerce, to the detriment of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, which from that time began to wane. The <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici family</a> took great interest in the prosperity of this stronghold; Alessandro de' Medici built the old fortress; Cosmo I, under the supervision of <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a>, built a breakwater and a new canal. But the real author of its greatness was Ferdinand I, who called Leghorn "his mistress". To increase its population he showered his favours on it and on those who went to live there, and made it a town of refuge for men from every nation, so that there flocked to it not only outlaws from all over <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but even Greeks, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> driven out of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Exiled <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> found a home there. Cosmo II erected a monument to Ferdinand, the work of Giovanni dell' Opera. Owing to the bombardment (by the English in 1651, and by the French in 1671) of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> fleet stationed in the harbour, Ferdinand II caused Leghorn to be declared a neutral port by international treaty (1691). This neutrality was violated for the first time in 1796 by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a "Continental blockade" did immense damage to the commerce of the town. In 1848 Leghorn was the hotbed of the <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> revolution.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> was created by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> in 1806. Its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Filippo Canucci. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has 32 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with 170,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> for men is 9, and for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 12. It has 3 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> for boys, and 7 for girls.
