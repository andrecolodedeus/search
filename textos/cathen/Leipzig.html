<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Leipzig</h1>  

<p>Chief town in the Kingdom of Saxony, situated at the junction of the Pleisse, Parthe, and Weisse Elster. In 1905 it contained 503,672 inhabitants, of whom 22,864 were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; the population today numbers about 545,000. The meaning of the word Leipzig, which is probably of Slavonic origin, is still uncertain. The latest investigations have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the region about Leipzig was originally occupied by the Teutons. With the migration of the nations, the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> settled there, but in the ninth century, the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> succeeded in re-establishing themselves. In 922 King Henry I conquered the Daleminzians, and laid out the fortified town of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a>. Other strongholds were subsequently founded in the vicinity. The first mention of Leipzig is to be found in the chronicle of <a href="../cathen/05047d.htm">Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg</a> (1009-18). Another German colony grew up beside this stronghold, to which Margrave Otto of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a> gave a charter (about 1160), the so-called <em>Stadtbrief</em> of Leipzig. According to this charter Leipzig was given the Magdeburg code of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and at the same time an important plan of extension was decided upon.

<p>The expansion of the German people was followed everywhere by the growth of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Leipzig belonged to the Diocese of Merseburg. The oldest church was Peterskapelle, the larger Nikol&#228;ikirche was built later. Of this, parts are still extant in the present church of that name. The Thomaskloster, the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, was founded in the reign of Margrave Dietrich (1197-1221); both the Nikol&#228;iskirche and the Peterskapelle were made subordinate to this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which was governed by the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a>. By purchase and through foundations the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, whose prior was freely elected by the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, gradually became possessed of considerable real estate and valuable <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>. A <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, the oldest in <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, was soon founded in connexion with the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Three other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> were founded in the town after the Thomaskloster; first that of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Sisters mentioned between 1220 and 1230, which found a great benefactor in Margrave Heinrich (1230-88); then the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> fathers, founded about 1229 and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1240 in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Merseburg, Naumburg, and Meissen; and lastly the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, which existed at least as early as 1253. Including these four <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> churches, Leipzig thus possessed six churches in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; to these were added the Katharinenkapelle (1240), the Marienkapelle (about 1262), and the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> belonging to the townhall and the castle (fifteenth century). The oldest <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> in the town was that founded together and in connexion with the Thomaskloster in 1213; its management was transferred from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> to the town in 1439. St John's <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, erected at the end of the thirteenth century, was originaly devoted to the care of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>.

<p>From the latter part of the twelfth century Leipzig was looked upon as the most important military station between the Saale and the Mulde. The <em>Messen</em> or annual fairs added greatly to the prosperity of the town; at first they were held in the Spring (<em>Jubilatemesse</em>) and Autumn (<em>Michaelismesse</em>), but after 1458 they were also held at <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> or the New Year. In 1419 Leipzig obtained from <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Pope Martin V</a> privileges on account of her fair, and received in 1515 a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> market privilege. The fame and importance of the city was greatly increased by still another event, namely the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1449 by the students and professors who had seceded from Prague on account of the tyrannical actions of the Czech-Hussite faction. The foundation was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Pope Alexander V</a> in 1409. Towards the latter part of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Agest</a> the state of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had changed for the worse. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> were becoming more worldly; in 1445 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Merseburg found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to attempt a reform of the Thomaskloster, but met with no success. The remedial measures tried by <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa</a> in 1451 brought about no permanent improvement. The preaching activity of St. John Capistran in 1455 was more successful, at least among members of his own order (the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>), but the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Sisters in Leipzig did everything in their power to impede a reform. Later on there was a division in both the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> orders, which led to mutual opposition, some contending for a more rigorous and some for a laxer interpretation of the rule. The relations between the town council and the townspeople on the one side and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, more particularly the regulars, on the other, became strained in the fifteenth century. The situation was further aggravated by the quarrel between the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Small wonder, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> reform movement soon found adherents in Leipzig.

<p>Another connexion which the city had with the new movement was that <a href="../cathen/14539a.htm">Tetzel</a> was a citizen, and also that <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> Theses of 1517 were printed there. The celebrated Disputation between <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and Karlstadt on one side and <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Eck</a> on the other also took place in Leipzig; this was held under the most brilliant auspices, and lasted from 27 June until 15 July, 1519. Although both sides claimed the victory, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> adherents increased so greatly that neither the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a> nor the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> dared announce in Leipzig before 1521 the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, which <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Eck</a> had brought from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Among the many scholars of the town who energetically opposed the new movement by word and writing, particular mention must be made of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Petrus Sylvius, Professor Dungersheim of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Augustin Alfeld, <a href="../cathen/05410a.htm">Hieronymus Emser</a>, and later Cochl&aelig;us. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> made no headway in <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a> and Leipzig as long as Duke George lived; he even commanded four hundred adherents of the new teaching to leave the town in 1552, and forbade the people of Leipzig to attend the <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">University of Wittenberg</a>. After his death in 1539 the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was introduced, and in 1543 all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> were suppressed, their lands sold, the buildings mostly torn down, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> public worship abolished. Besides the Disputation, there is another important event of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> period connected with the town of Leipzig: the so-called Leipzig Interim (see <a href="../cathen/08077b.htm">I<font size=-2>NTERIMS </font></a>).

<p>In connexion with the political history of the town there are many events which deserve special mention. The town suffered greatly during the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>. In 1631 <a href="../cathen/14724c.htm">Tilly</a> appeared before it with his army and captured it, but was defeated at Breitenfeld by Gustavus Adolphus on 17 September. Leipzig was besieged seven times and was captured six; from 1642 until 1560 it was in the possession of the Swedes; in 1706 it had to pay heavy tribute to Charles XII. Even more oppressive were the burdens of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> imposed on the town by the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussians</a> during the Second Silesian War in 1745 and during the Seven Years War. In consequence its trade and industries were ruined for years. In the Napoleonic Wars Leipzig was occupied by the French Marshal Davoust in 1806 after the Battle of Jena and Auerst&#228;dt; in 1809 it was pillaged by the Duke of Brunswick; and it was only after the battle of Leipzig (16-18 October, 1813) that the town was freed from heavy taxation and oppression. Half a million men fought in this mammoth battle, by which <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> was liberated from <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> yoke. After Saxony's accession to the German Customs' Union in the year 1834, the town received a new impetus. While in 1834 it only numbered 45,000 inhabitants, it had 107,000 in 1871, 149,000 in 1880, 455,000 in 1900, and at the present time (1910) has 545,000.

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was accomplished, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> became wholly extinct; at least there is no mention of any <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> until about 1710. Only during the time of the fair <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> came from Halberstadt to Leipzig to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. No mention is made of where the services were held. In 1710 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> received permission to celebrate <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> openly, and Elector Frederick Augustus I, who <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in order to be King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, gave up the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Pleissenburg to them, where on 3 June, 1710, Mass was again said. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> was in charge of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, at first two fathers, but after 1743 there were three. As <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> of the elector, or king, they received from the court in Dresden their salaries and rent allowance. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> also found a place in the Pleissenburg. When in 1738 the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> became too small for the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, the elector gave funds to replace it by a larger one. The fathers did not confine their activity to Leipzig alone, but extended it as far as Merseburg, Chemnitz, Naumburg, Wittenburg, etc.; and from 1749 they were also entrusted with the spiritual care of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>. After the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society of Jesus</a>, the fathers remained as <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who subsequently laboured in Leipzig, came for the most part from <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, particularly <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. When in the nineteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Pleissenburg became dilapidated, and had to be given up, the town council placed the Matth&#228;ikirche at certain hours at the disposal of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> means for the building of a new church had been partly collected by the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> efforts of the chief <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the Saxon <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in those days, Bishop and Apostolic Vicar Franz Laurens Mauermann. In 1845 the foundation stone of the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church was laid, and in 1847 it was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Joseph Dittrich. As the town developed, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregation also grew; their esteemed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> Franz Stolle built the rectory in 1871, founded the Societies of St. Vincent and St. Elizabeth with their homes, the reading association, etc. In 1892 the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of the second <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church was laid in Leipzig-Reudnitz; in 1907 the Marienkirche in Leipzig-Plagwitz-Lindenau, and in 1888 a new large <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was built, in addition to which <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> have been established in the newly incorporated suburbs.

<p>At the present time Leipzig has three <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches and two <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; a <em>Stammschule</em> comprising a public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and a high school; three branch <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; three institutions belonging to the Grey <a href="../cathen/05388a.htm">Sisters of St. Elizabeth</a>, who have charge of St. Vincent's establishment (institution for the care of the sick, boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and public kitchen), St. Joseph's Home (institution for the care of the sick and surgical clinic), and St. Elizabeth's Home (home for single <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and servants). Among the well-developed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions worthy of mention are the Society of St. Vincent and also of St. Elizabeth, the Apprentices' Club, the Club for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Business Men, the Association of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Teachers, two students' corporations, the Workingmen's Guild, the Marienverein, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Casino, the <a href="../cathen/02688c.htm">Borromean Society</a>, and others.
