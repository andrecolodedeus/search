<h1>Leitmeritz</h1>  

<p>(L<font size=-2>ITOMERICENSIS</font>), in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, embraces the northern part of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Kingdom of Bohemia</a> (see map accompanying <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">A<font size=-2>USTRIA-</font>H<font size=-2>UNGARY</font></a>).
<h2 id="section1">History</h2>

<p>After the introduction of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> under <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and Louis the German, the present Diocese of Leitmeritz formed part of the <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Diocese of Ratisbon</a>. Before the end of the tenth century the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> was so widespread that <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Emperor Otto I</a> founded the first <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> diocese (Prague) in 973, which included all <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. The first church in Leitmeritz, dedicated to St. Wenceslaus, was built in 925, while in 1057 Duke Spitihnew built St. Stephen's church and founded a collegiate chapter. In time numerous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were built; in 1384 the city, with its suburbs, possessed thirteen <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and, besides numerous religious, twenty <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> engaged in the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>. The Hussite Wars put an end to this flourishing <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization. In 1421 Ziska appeared before Leitmeritz, which was spared only on condition of accepting the Hussite religion. The collegiate church alone, despoiled of its possessions, held firm to the old rite of Communion under one kind. Hussitism was the forerunner of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, which found the ground already prepared on account of the long religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, the decline of learning among <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, the lack of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the insubordination of the nobles, who had become rich and powerful through the wealth and possessions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. At first the nobility accepted the teaching of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, and in many cities the transition from Ultraquism to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> soon followed. Through the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Gallus Cahera, a disciple of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, Leitmeritz was also won over to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> brought a reaction. By the victorious campaign of the emperor in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> the revolutionary nobles were overthrown, the cities lost their privileges, and the people <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> or again became <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. For the better administration of the large <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Archdiocese of Prague</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that time, Count Ernst Adalbert von Harrach, a nephew of Wallenstein, divided its territory, and created the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/08688b.htm">K&ouml;niggr&#228;tz</a> and Leitmeritz as its suffragans.

<p>In 1655 the then <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the collegiate chapter of Leitmeritz, Baron Max Rudolf von Schleinitz, was named first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Leitmeritz (1655-75). He built the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to replace the small collegiate church, organized the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and expended his whole fortune on the improvement of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. His successor, Count Jaroslaus Franz Ignaz von Sternberg (1676-1709), finished the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and erected the episcopal curia (1694-1701). The fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Johann Adam, Count Wratislaus von Mitrowitz (1721-33), appears to have administered also the <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Archdiocese of Prague</a>. In the Seven Years War, during the administration of Duke Moritz Adolf of Sachsen-Zeitz (1733-59), who built the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, the diocese had much to suffer from the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussians</a>. His successor, Count Emanuel Ernst von Waldstein (1760-89), made little opposition to the efforts of the Government to spread through the diocese the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="../cathen/07463a.htm">Febronius</a>; the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a>, etc. were confiscated, many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> closed as superfluous, and all brotherhoods disbanded. In 1784 the territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was increased by two districts. The next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Ferdinand Kindermann, Ritter von Schulstein (1790-1801), had before his appointment to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> won deserved fame as a reformer and organizer of the whole <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> system of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>; as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he continued to direct <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, built the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and erected an institute for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of girls at Leitmeritz. The eighth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Wenzel Leopold Chlumchansky, Ritter von Prestawlk and Chlumchan (1802-15), a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> father of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, built the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> in 1805. Joseph Franz Hurdalek (1815-1823) was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to resign. <a href="../cathen/10302a.htm">Vincent Eduard Milde</a> (1823-32) became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. Augustin Bartholom&#228;us Hille (1832-65) opened in 1851 the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys and a normal college. He was succeeded by Augustin Paul Wahala (1866-77), in whose time originated in Warnsdorf the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a>; Anton Ludwig Frind (1879-81), the learned author of the "Ecclesiastical History of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>"; and Emmanuel Johann Sch&ouml;bel (1882-1909), to whom the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is indebted for many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and for the introduction of popular missions; and Joseph Gross (<a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 23 May, 1910).
<h2 id="section2">Statistics</h2>

<p>In 1909 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> numbered 28 vicariates, 2 provostships, 3 archdeaneries, 37 deaneries, 392 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 7 <em>Exposituren</em> (substantially independent filial churches), 343 stations, chaplaincies, and curacies, 26 other <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, 628 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 397 public <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 756 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> engaged in the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>, 87 other <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 140 religious <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 1,598,900 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 33,560 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, 10,400 <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a>, and 18,300 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has much to contend with. For centuries two different races (German and Czech), and two different <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> (<a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>), have existed side by side, and national and religious disputes are of frequent occurrence. The <em>Los-von-Rom</em> movement, having its origin in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, sought in the Diocese of Leitmeritz, situated on the borders, a vantage ground for the propagation of its <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and as a result thousands of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> drifted away from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Another difficulty is the lack of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, over a hundred vacancies existing in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The language spoken in twenty of the vicariates is German, in six Czech, and in two is mixed. More than a third of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are Czech. There are 309 German <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 95 Czech, and the rest mixed. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter possesses a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, a dean, five capitulary, and six honorary canons. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are trained in the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> training <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Leitmeritz. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> intermediate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are the private gymnasium of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at Mariaschein, which is at the same time the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys, and five <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, of which two are in Reichenberg and one each at Leitmeritz, Teplitz-Sch&ouml;nau, and Jungbunzlau. In the public primary and secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has very little opportunity to impart religious instruction. For girls, however, there are several institutions for instruction and training conducted by sisters: 8 boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 10 primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 2 secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and 20 advanced and industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.

<p>The following orders have foundations in the diocese (1909): <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> at Ossegg, 1 <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> (founded in 1293), with an extensive <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and gallery of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>; the fathers teach in the Gymnasium of Komotau; <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, 1 college in Mariaschein; <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Piarists</a>; <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>; <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>; Augustinians; Reformed <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>; <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a>; <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>; Order of Malta; Crosier Fathers; <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>; the Congregation of the Sacred Heart. In 1909 the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> orders and congregations in the diocese had 68 foundations, with 654 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, 93 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and 15 <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>: Congregation of St. Elizabeth, 1; <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, 1; <a href="../cathen/10201a.htm">Borromeans</a>, 23; Sisters of the Cross, 22; Poor School Sisters of Our Lady, 5; <a href="../cathen/05052f.htm">Daughters of Divine Charity</a>, 2; <a href="../cathen/12254a.htm">Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ</a>, 4; <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters, 3; <a href="../cathen/03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a>, 5; and <a href="../cathen/03711a.htm">Sisters of Christian Charity</a>, 1 foundation. Among the <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> under religious management are 20 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, 7 asylums for children, 14 kindergartens, 1 reformatory, and 20 <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">infant asylums</a>; the diocese conducts also its own institute for the deaf and dumb at Leitmeritz. Of the many associations, the following are worthy of mention: C&#228;cilienverein (Association of St. Cecilia), the <a href="../cathen/01633a.htm">Apostleship of Prayer</a>, the Marian Confraternities, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Teachers' Association, the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a>, the Gesellenvereine, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> People's Unions (60), and others. There are 55 shrines and places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the most popular being Mariaschein, B&ouml;hmisch-Kamenitz, Ossegg, Philippsdorf, and Krieschitz. The principal church of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, built in 1671 in <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> style. The most ancient is St. Clement's in Levy-Hradec. Among others, the beautiful churches of Melnik. Nimburg, Aussig and Saaz, the chief churches of their respective deaneries, and the town church of Br&uuml;x date from Gothic times, and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the collegiate church of Ossegg, and the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> church of Mariaschein from the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> period. The churches of Eichwald, Philippsdorf, St. Vincent in Reichenberg, the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Elizabeth in Teplitz-Sch&ouml;nau, and others, were built in the nineteenth century.
