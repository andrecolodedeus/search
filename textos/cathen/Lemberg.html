<h1>Lemberg</h1>  

<p>Seat of a Latin, a <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>. The city is called Lwow in Polish, Leopol in latinized Polish, L&ouml;wenburg in German, Lwihohrod in <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a>. It was founded in 1259 by the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> King Daniel for his son Leo, Prince of Halicz, and took its name from that prince. Destroyed by the Tatars in 1261, it was rebuilt in 1270 on the same spot by Prince Leo, as is recorded by the inscription on one of its gates: "Dux Leo mihi fundamenta jecit, posteri nomen dedere Leontopolis" (Duke Leo laid my foundations, posterity gave me the name of <a href="../cathen/09181a.htm">Leontopolis</a>). In 1340 Casimir the Great, King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, took possession of it, built two new castles, attracted German colonists to it, and gave it a charter modelled on that of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>. In 1372 Louis of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> entrusted the administration of the city to <a href="../cathen/15680b.htm">Wladislaw</a>, Prince of Oppeln; in 1387 it was given as dowry to the Princess Hedwig, by whose marriage with Jagellon it became a possession of the Polish Crown. Lemberg was thenceforward the recognized capital of the Russian territories dependent on <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (i.e. Red <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>), which preserved their autonomy undiminished until 1433. The city was one of the great entrep&ocirc;ts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> commerce with the East, which, after the taking of Constantinople by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, followed for the most part the overland route. Lemberg was besieged many times &#151; by the Lithuanians in 1350, the Wallachians in 1498, the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in 1524 and 1672, and the Cossacks in 1648 and 1655. Charles XII of Sweden took and plundered it in 1704. By the first partition of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> it was assigned to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in 1772; finally, in 1848, it revolted and was bombarded.

<p>Lemberg is situated in a deep and narrow valley on the Pelter, a tributary of the Bug; the capital of the Austrian Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, it contains &#151; including its many and populous suburbs &#151; about 160,000 inhabitants, of whom 45,000 are <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> which, in the seventeenth century, gained for it the name of "City of Monks", some still exist. <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a> reduced the number of its <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> from seventy-two to about twenty; some of them are very noteworthy &#151; e.g. the Latin <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, built in the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, built in 1740-9 in the neo-Italian style; the church of the <a href="../cathen/02507a.htm">Bernardines</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. John of Dukla, Patron of Lemberg; the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, the Wallachian, and other churches. The national Ossolinski Institute possesses a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the highest value for the study of Polish literature and local history, containing more than 100,000 volumes and 4000 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, founded in 1660 by Casimir of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, suffered especially from the withdrawal of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the political changes which culminated in Galicia becoming an Austrian province. It was restored in 1784, though with curtailed privileges and a much restricted staff, by <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, who desired to keep the Polish youth from going to Vilna or Warsaw. Reduced in 1807 to the rank of a lyceum, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was once more established with some measure of its former autonomy in 1816. It now numbers about 200 professors and tutors, with 1900 students, 300 of whom attend the faculty of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. The city also possesses a large number of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> for boys and girls, besides many benevolent institutions.
<h2>Latin archbishopric</h2>

<p>The Latin Bishopric of Halicz, in which that of Lemberg originated, appears to have been established no earlier than the year 1361. On 8 April, 1363, <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a> wrote to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> to insist that King Casimir III of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> should build a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in the city of Lemberg, which he had recently taken from the Russian schismatics. Nevertheless, letters of <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 13 February, 1375, mention only the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Halicz, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of Przemysl, <a href="../cathen/03645d.htm">Chelm</a>, and Vladimir, sufficient evidence that that of Lemberg was not yet established. On 3 March, 1375, the question is raised of transferring the See of Halicz to Lemberg, a transfer which was effected only in December, 1414, by <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>. In 1501 Bishop Andreas Rosza was given the administration of Przemysl, but was transferred in 1503 to the See of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>; his successor, Bernardine Wilczek (1503-40), rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which had been destroyed by fire. Many of the subsequent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were famous; such were Stanislaus Grochovski (1634-45), a writer of religious poetry, and Nicholas Poplavski (1709-11), an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer. A great many <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were held here from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries. Upon the opening of the Estates (or Diet) of Galicia, 13 February, 1817, Archbishop Skarbel Ankvicz obtained the title of <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of the Kingdoms of Galicia and Lodomeria, which title has been accorded since 1849 to the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. The Latin <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdiocese</a> has two suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>: Przemysl and Tarnov. It numbers 920,000 <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, 36,000 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and 550,000 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. There are 249 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 579 secular and 290 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> &#151; <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, etc. There are also a great many religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> engaged in teaching and works of mercy. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> numbers 60 students.


<h2>Ruthenian Catholic archbishopric</h2>

<p>After the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> in this region to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, the Bishopric of Halicz, suffragan to Kiev, was established for their benefit between 1152 and 1180. Halicz had been made a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> in 1345 by John Calecas, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, but in 1347 it was again placed under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Kiev, at the request of the Grand Duke Simeon of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>. Its <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank was restored to Halicz only after the Polish occupation of the province about 1371; it had four suffragans: Kulm, Przemysl, Turof, and Vladimir. In 1414 King Ladislaus, for some unknown reason, transferred the Latin See of Halicz to Leopol, and suppressed the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Halicz. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was subsequently administered by vicars of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kiev until 28 October, 1539, when it was restored as a simple <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. Macarius Tuczapsti, the titular, next year changed his residence to Lemberg and took the combined titles of Halicz and Lemberg, which his successors have borne, adding those of Kamenets and Podolia, when their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> extended so far. With the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in this county began the reform of the extremely <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who gradually turned towards <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1597 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lemberg, the celebrated Gideon Balaban, brought his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> back to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, but afterwards, through his <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, he relapsed into <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and with him nearly all his subjects. A council held at Lemberg in October, 1629, laboured in vain for the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and it was not until the end of the seventeenth century that Bishop Joseph Czumlanski embraced the cause of union, secretly at first in 1677, and then openly in 1700. After Joseph came Barlaam Czeptyski (1710-5) and <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> Czeptyski (1715-46), who, being promoted to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Kiev, retained that of Lemberg with it. This example was followed by Leo Louis Czeptyski (1749-79), when he became <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> in 1762.

<p>Under Peter Bielanski (1779-98) the Diocese of Lemberg, to which were united those of Halicz and Kamenets, fortunately became the possession of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, whose government took in hand the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who were poor and so <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> as hardly to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> their own rite. <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> had students sent to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> established at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> for the Hungarian Uniats. <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> turned the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> into a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, adding to it the church and the garden, and soon the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> students had places reserved for them in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of the city. On 22 February, 1807, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "In universalis ecclesi&aelig; regimine", withdrew Lemberg from the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Kiev and made it a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>, with Kulm and Przemysl as suffragans. The Diocese of Kulm was dependent on Lemberg until 1837, when it was made <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> until its suppression by <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. In its place another suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, that of Stanislaov, was given to Lemberg in 1856. The Emperor of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> obtained from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to nominate the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and his suffragans, while the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> was authorized to confirm their <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> and to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> them, as had formerly been granted to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Kiev by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>. The Habsburg monarchy has seriously taken up the task of developing <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and of putting them upon the same footing as the Latin <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> by giving them the same political <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, and lastly of teaching the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> language in <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> &#151; a point as to which the Poles had previously cared little. Between the Poles and <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, indeed, there has always existed a certain hostility, which, during the nineteenth century, resulted in violent controversies, and eventually, in 1862, necessitated the intervention of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In addition, the young <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, with their exaggerated <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of their rite and nationality, have accentuated their peculiarities and fostered the spirit of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> together with an excessive affection for <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Thus, they have shown an inclination to return to the primitive Gr&aelig;co-Slavic Rite, and to suppress the modifications which in former times had been &#151; wrongly perhaps &#151; introduced into the Liturgy, but which, in the minds of the people, have now become to a certain extent identified with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. Hence continual religious troubles have arisen, and indeed numerous defections. The reform of the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> inaugurated by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> has in part remedied these fatal tendencies, which, however, are still the chief danger threatening the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of this archdiocese.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> archdiocese comprises the districts of Lemberg, Stryj, Brzezany, Zloczow, and Tarnopol, and numbers 1,400,000 faithful. There are 881 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> &#151; 21 religious, 25 <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibate</a> seculars, 148 widowers, and 687 married. There is a chapter of 10 canons and a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consistory of 23 members. The archdiocese is divided into 30 deaconeries and 752 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. There are 749 churches with, and 500 without, resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and 36 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which counts 248 students, is intended also for the service of the other two Galician <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, Przemysl and Stanislaov; 108 of these students belong to the Archdiocese of Lemberg, while the other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> are <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> have 3 houses with 23 religious; the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, 2 houses with 68 religious; the Servants of the Blessed Virgin Mary (founded in 1892), 6 houses with 39 religious.
<h2>Armenian Catholic archbishopric</h2>

<p>As early as 1062 there were <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> settled at Kiev, in consequence of the various invasions and persecutions of Tatars, <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and Greeks. Thence these exiles migrated to Lemberg, Kamenets, and <a href="../cathen/09463b.htm">Lutzk</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> archdiocese was founded in 1365, upon the union of the titular, Gregory, with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was built two years later. From 1492 to 1516 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a>, after which it was occupied by schismatics until 24 October, 1630, when Nicholas Toroszewicz took the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of fidelity to <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>. Since then the succession of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> has been regular (<a href="../cathen/06376a.htm">Gams</a>,("Series epis. Ecclesi&aelig; cath.", 351; suppl., lxxxiii; Petit in Vacant, "Dict. de th&eacute;ol. cath.", I, 1916).
