<h1>Leonard Calvert</h1>  

<p>Proprietary Governor of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, 1634-1647, born in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 1607; died in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, 9 June, 1647. He was the second son of <a href="../cathen/03192a.htm">George Calvert</a>, first Lord Baltimore. In 1629 he was sent to <a href="../cathen/10782a.htm">Newfoundland</a> in charge of a vessel to protect the colony of Avalon against the depredations of French cruisers. In 1633, his brother, the <a href="../cathen/03193a.htm">second Lord Baltimore</a>, appointed him Governor of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and sent him in charge of an expedition to make a settlement. Two vessels, the Ark and <a href="../cathen/05144b.htm">Dove</a>, carrying over 300 settlers sailed from the harbour of Cowes, 22 November, 1633, arriving at point Comfort, <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, 24 February, 1634. On 27 March they landed at what is now St. Mary's, then the site of an Indian village, and they began the work of establishing a settlement. The <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indians</a> received them kindly and sold them the land. Clayborne of the Virginia colony had established a trading post on Kent Island, which was in the domain of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. After the settlement at St. Mary's this trade was continued. Trouble arose and Clayborne went to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to lay is claims before the king, but was informed that the island belonged to Lord Baltimore. The governor at once took possession of the island and established a settlement there.

<p>The troubles in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> following 1640 were responsible for disturbances in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. In 1643 Governor Calvert went to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to discuss policies with the proprietor, leaving the affairs of the colony in charge of acting Governor Brent. At the close of 1643 Captain Ingle appeared at St. Mary's with a vessel commissioned by Parliament. The ship was captured and the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> against Parliament was tendered the crew. Ingle escaped. When Governor Calvert returned he found the colony distracted by factions. Ingle returned the following year, and, with the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and Clayborne, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, including Governor Calvert, were driven into <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>. An <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of submission was tendered but not one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> took it. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were sent to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. A state of <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a> prevailed for two years. Calvert returned in 1646 and captured St. Mary's, and in the following year Kent island. He favored the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of initiative in legislation by the colonists and won for them this <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privilege</a>. In the difficulty between the proprietor and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, he sympathized with the latter and prevented a rupture between them. In 1890 the state of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> erected a monument to him and his wife at St. Mary's.
