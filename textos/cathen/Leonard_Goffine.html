<h1>Leonard Goffine</h1>  

<p>(Or G<font size=-2>OFFIN&Eacute;</font>).

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, or according to some, at Broich, 6 December, 1648; died 11 August, 1719. At the age of nineteen he entered the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> Abbey of Steinfeld, in the Eifel district of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and commenced his two years <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in July 1667. Having made his solemn profession on 16 July, 1667, he was sent for his course of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> college at cologne. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on Ember Saturday before <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, 1667, Goffine was sent to Dunwald to assist the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who were charged with the direction of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> canonesses. In the same capacity he was afterwards sent to Ellen, where there was also a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. Goffine remained four years in each of these places, being recalled by the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, 26 February, 1680, to fill the office of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> master in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. He was next given charge of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Clarholz, which was incorporated with the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> abbey of the same name, in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, for owing to the dearth of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> due to the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran heresy</a> and the Thirty Year War, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to have recourse to other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders to fill the vacancies.

<p>Goffine remained at Clarholz five years (1680-85), and was sent thence to Niederehe, a <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> which the Abbey of Steinfeld possessed in the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. He remained in Niederehe but a very short time, being sent in 1885 to assist the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/08757a.htm">St. Lambert's</a> at Coesfield, in the Diocese of Munster. He left Coesfeld in 1691, when, at the urgent request of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, he undertook the charge of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, first of Wehr (1691-94), then of Rheinbollen (1694-96), and afterwards of Oberstein on the Nahe, from December, 1696, until his death in 1719. While <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Oberstein he had also to attend the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> living at Weiersbach, in the Diocese of Mayence. The inhabitants of Oberstein were mostly <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and at times Goffine had much annoyance to bear from them. Animated with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a>, Goffine was all things to all men, and, as Dr. Joseph Prickartz, president of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> college at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, wrote, in a sketch of his life, "Goffine was a truly apostolic <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, filled with an untiring <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, who edified everyone by his word and by his example. The purity of his life, the integrity of his <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, the fervour of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>, the pleasing style of his writings, commanded the respect of even the enemies of his religion. From the rudest and most forward of these he had often to endure the bitterest insults, but at these he showed himself the more cheerful, since by them he became the more conformable to those who had the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> to suffer insults for the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Jesus</a>". This is a character sketch of the saintly <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, not only during the twenty-three years he worked at Oberstein, but even from the day of his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.

<p>In the month of July, 1719, he returned to the Abbey of Steinfeld in order to be present at the feast of St. Norbert (July 11), and to follow the spiritual exercises during the octave. On the Sunday during the octave he preached the panegyric of the holy founder, and on 16 July he celebrated the golden jubilee of his own <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>.

<p>After the octave he returned to Oberstein, and less than a month later he rendered his well-tried <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Goffine himself states that he had taken St. Norbert, the founder of his order, as his model, "because St. Norbert cared and worked so much for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>." Observing that so many had gone astray through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, he was most anxious and always ready to instruct the people, both old and young, for whose benefit he wrote and published no fewer than ten books. While he was at Coesfeld he wrote his well-known work, "Handpostille oder Christkatholische Unterrichtungen auf alle Sonn und Feyer-tagen des ganzen Jahrs" (brief commentaries in the form of question and answer on the Proper of the mass, principally on the Epistle and gospel of the day). This book was ready in 1687, and in 1688 it received the imprimatur of the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of Munster, and in 1690 the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of Rev. William Heimbach, <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Meer, and of Rev. John Dirking, Rector of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>. The first edition, printed at Mayence in 1690, was soon exhausted, and a second edition was printed at Cologne in 1692. Since then other editions have appeared at short intervals, and it is said that hardly any book, with the exception of the <a href="../cathen/07674c.htm">"Imitation of Christ"</a> by <a href="../cathen/14661a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Kempis</a>, has had as many editions and translations as Goffine's "Handpostille". As far as can be ascertained translations have been made into Moravian, Bohemian, <a href="../cathen/07560a.htm">Hungarian</a>, English, French, Italian, and Flemish.

<p>A writer in "Le Magasin Catholique Illustre", says of the worth of this book: "How many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> has this book not saved and preserved from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, during the last two centuries that it has been known in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>? Here is an instance: whenever in this classical land of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> this book has become popular, the door was shut to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Goffine's instructions, the like of which we have nothing in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, gives the dogmatic, moral, and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>", etc. As Father Hattler, S.J., writes: "the child reads from it, for <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father and mother</a>; the bride is presented with it on the day of her wedding; it is given to the emigrant when he leaves his country for the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>." Goffine also published the following books: (1) "Auslegung der Regel des heiligen Augustinus" (Cologne, 1692); (2) "Trostbuch in Tr&uuml;bsalen" (Cologne); (3) "Cibus anim&aelig; matutinalis, etc." (Cologne, 1705); (4) "Sermons for the whole year", 2 vols. (Nuremberg, 1705); (5) "Erklarung des Katechismi Petri Canisii" (Cologne, 1712); (6) "Die Lehre Christi" (Cologne, 1715); (7) "Kleiner Kinder-katechismus" (Cologne, 1717); (8) "Der Wachter des gottlichen Worts" (Cologne, 1718); (9) "Praxes Sacr&aelig; seu modus explicandi c&aelig;remonias per annum" (Frankfort, 1719).
