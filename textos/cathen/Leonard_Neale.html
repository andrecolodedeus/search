<h1>Leonard Neale</h1>  

<p>Second <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, b. near Port Tobacco, Charles County, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, 15 Oct., 1746; d. at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a>, D.C., 18 June, 1817. He was a descendant of Captain James Neale, the founder of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in America, who settled in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> as early as 1642. At twelve Leonard was sent to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> at <a href="../cathen/13365c.htm">St. Omers</a> in French <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. Thence he went to <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, and later to <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. On the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society of Jesus</a>, Father Neale, together with the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, repaired to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he engaged in pastoral work for four years, but in response to his petition for a foreign mission, he was assigned to Demarara, in <a href="../cathen/07062a.htm">British Guiana</a>, South America, where he laboured from 1779-83. Discouraged by the slow improvement of the people and with health impaired by the climate, he set sail for America in January, 1783, arriving in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> in April, associating himself with his former <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> brethren of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, among them the Rev. John Carroll. During the yellow fever epidemic in Philadelphia, in 1793, the two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of that city were stricken and Father Neale gladly took their place. For nearly six years he remained there, acting as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to the then Bishop Carroll of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. During the second visitation of the yellow fever to Philadelphia in 1797-8, he was overtaken by the dread disease. In 1798 Bishop Carroll called Father Neale from Philadelphia to succeed Rev. Dr. Dubourg in the presidency of the college at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a>. He acted in the dual capacity of president and tutor for several years and under his guidance the institution was developed from an academy into a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in 1801. The venerable Bishop Carroll had some time previous to this applied to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to name Father Neale as his co-adjutor. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Bishop Carroll in 1800, but remained as President of Georgetown until 1806 when he was succeeded by the Rev. Father Molyneux.

<p>Upon the death of Archbishop Carroll on 3 December, 1815, Bishop Neale succeeded him and received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> the following year. Already nearly seventy years old he lived most of the time at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a> in quiet and retirement, but when is his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as the highest dignitary of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> called him to <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, he was remarkably energetic for one of his age and feeble health. While in Philadelphia Father Neale had made the acquaintance of Miss Alice Lalor, through whose aid he started a small <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> conducted by three ladies, which was destined to be the seed of a great <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> teachers in America. This <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was broken up by the ravages of yellow fever, but the project was revived by Bishop Neale who requested Miss Lalor with another lady from Philadelphia to come to Georgetown. They associated themselves with the Order of St. Clare, or <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>. In 1805, on the death of their <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a> returned to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, selling their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to Bishop Neale, who conveyed it to Miss Lalor and her associates, whom he permitted to enter into simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in 1813. After his accession to the See of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> petitioned <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> for the regular establishment of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Order of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a>, which request was readily granted.

<p>His health failing, Archbishop Neale applied to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to have Bishop <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> associated with him in governing the <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Diocese of Baltimore</a> with the right of succession. But Bishop <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> objected, proposing instead that a coadjutor be appointed with the right of succession. To this the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> agreed, and Rev. Ambrose Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal was selected by Archbishop Neale, who proposed his name to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. By a brief of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 24 July, 1817, Father Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal was appointed coadjutor with right of succession, under the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Strauropolis <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus infidelium</a>, but before the arrival of the brief the venerable <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> had already died.
