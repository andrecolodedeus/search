<h1>Leontius Byzantinus</h1>  

<p>(<em>Leontios Byzantios</em>)

<p>An important <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the sixth century. In spite of his deserved fame there are few <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers whose lives have been so much discussed. Till quite lately even his period was not considered certain. <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> and Labbe placed him before the fifth general council (Constantinople A.D. 553; cf. "Scriptores eccles.", <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1728, VII, 204). He has been assigned to the time of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> (590-604; Mir&aelig;us, "Bibl. eccl.", <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, 1639, 211); identified with Bishop Leontius of <a href="../cathen/13393a.htm">Salamis</a> in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> (in the VII cent.; Cave, "Script. eccles. hist. litt.", <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, 1720, 352); and the <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenist</a> Leontius mentioned in the "Life of Sabas" by Cyril of <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Scythopolis</a> (Canisius-Basnage, "Thesaurus monum. eccles.", <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, 1725, 529 and 533). There is, or was, the same uncertainty about his works; the authenticity of many books under his name has been discussed continually. In short, <a href="../cathen/05745a.htm">Fabricius</a> said with some reason that (at his time) it was impossible to come to any clear conception of who Leontius really was, or what he really wrote (Fabricius Harles, "Biblioth. Gr&aelig;ca", <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, 1802, VIII 310). In his account of himself, in a work whose authenticity is undisputed (Contra Nest. et Eutych.) he says that in his youth he had belonged to the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, but was converted by "holy men who cleansed his heart by the works of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>" (P.G., LXXXVI, 1358 and 1360). Other works ("Adv. Nest.", and "Adv. Monoph.") describe him in their title as a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (P. 0., LXXXVI 1399 and 1769). Friedrich Loofs has made a special study of his life and works. As far as the Life is concerned, his conclusion is accepted in the main by Ehrhard and Krumbacher (Byzant. Litt., 55), Bardenhewer (Patrologie, 506-508), and to some extent R&uuml;gamer.

<p>According to Loofs, Leontius was the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of that name who came with others (Scythians) to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 519, to try to persuade Pope Hormisdas (514-523) to authorize the formula (suspect of <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>) "One of the Trinity suffered", and was also the Ongenist Leontius of the "Vita S. Sab&aelig;". He was born, probably at Constantinople, about 485, of a distinguished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> related to the imperial general Vitalian. He then joined the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> in Scythia but was converted and became a stanch defender of Ephesus. Early in his life he became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. He came to Constantinople in 519, and then to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as part of the embassy of Scythian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. After that he was for a time in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. In 531 he took part in public disputes arranged by Justinian (527-565) between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> followers of Severus of Antioch (538). He stayed at the capital till about 538, then went back to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Later he was again at Constantinople, where he died, apparently before the first Edict against the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">"Three Chapters"</a> (544). Loofs dates his death at "about 543". His change of residence accounts for the various descriptions of him as "a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>" and "a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Constantinople". This theory, explained and defended at length by Loofs, supposes the identification of our author with the "Venerable <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Leontius and Legate of the Fathers (<a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>) of the holy city (Jerusalem)" who took part in Justinian's controversy (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, VIII, 818; cf. 911 and 1019); with the Scythian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Leontius who came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 519 (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, VIII, 498 and 499); and with the <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenist</a> <a href="../cathen/09179b.htm">Leontius of Byzantium</a>, of whom Cyril of <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Scythopolis</a> writes in his "Life of St. Sabas" (Cotelerius, "Ecclesi&aelig; gr&aelig;c&aelig; monumenta", Paris, 1686).

<p>R&uuml;gamer admits the period of Leontius's life defended by Loofs (this may now be considered accepted), and the identification with the disputant at Constantinople (Leontius von Byzanz, 56-58). He thinks his identity with the Scythian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. Leontius himself never mentions Scythia as a place where he has lived; he does not defend the famous sentence "One of the Trinity suffered" with the ardour one would expect in one of its chief patrons (ibid., pp. 54-56). R&uuml;gamer altogether denies the identification with the <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenist</a> Leontius. Had he been an <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origenist</a> his name would not be so <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in Byzantine tradition, where he appears as "blessed", "all-wise", and "a great <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>" (ibid., pp. 58-63) According to R&uuml;gamer, Leontius spent his youth and became a <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> at Constantinople at the time of the <a href="../cathen/07218b.htm">Henoticon</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> (482-519). He went after his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> to Jerusalem and became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> there. He had never been a public orator, as some author's (Nirselil, "Lehrbuch der Patrologie und Patristik", Mainz, 1885, p. 553) conclude from the title <em>scholastikos</em> (the common one for such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; it is often given to him). On the contrary, he shows no special legal or forensic training, and never refers to such a career in his youth. So <em>scholastikos</em> in his case can only mean learned man, He came to Constantinople for the disputation, went back to Jerusalem, was superior of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> there, was an enemy of <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, but yet did not desire the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">"Three Chapters"</a>, and died after 553 (op. cit., pp. 49-72).

<p>The works ascribed to Leontius Byzantinus are: (1) three books "Against the Nestorians and Eutychians" (commonly quoted as "Contra Nestorianos et Eutychianos", P.G., LXXXVI 1267-1396). This is certainly authentic (in other words, the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> about whom they dispute is the author of this work). It is his earliest composition. Book I refutes the opposite <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of Nestorius and <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>, and establishes the Faith of Chalcedon. Book II, in dialogue form, refutes the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the Aphthartodocetes (mitigated <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> who made our Lord's <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> incorruptible during His life on earth-therefore not a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>). Book III (the title of this book in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> belongs really to Book II) accuses the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> of dishonest practices to make converts, and vehemently attacks <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>. The whole work is full of well-selected quotations from the Fathers, and shows great learning and controversial skill. All the other works have been disputed, at least in their present form. (2) "Against the Monophysites" ("Adv. Monophysitas", P.G., LXXXVI, 1769-1902), in two parts, but incomplete. Part I argues philosophically from the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of nature; part II quotes the witness of the Fathers, and refutes texts alleged to favour <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>. (3) "Against the Nestorians" ("Adv. Nestorianos", P.G., LXXXVI, 1399-1768). in eight books, of which the last is wanting. "A classical work" (Nirsehi, op. cit., 555), explaining and defending all the issues against this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Book IV defends the title <em>Theotokos</em>; Book VII defends the formula: "One of the Trinity suffered". (4) "Scholia" or "Of Sects" ("De Sectis", P. 0., LXXXVI, 1193-1268); ten chapters called "Acts" (<em>praxeis</em>) against all the known <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> at that time, including <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Sarnaritans. (5) Solution of the arguments proposed by Severus" (of Antioch; "Adv. Severum" P.G., LXXXVI, 1915-46). A refutation of Monophysitisim in dialogue form. It supposes a <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> work (otherwise unknown) whose order it follows. (6) "Thirty chapters against Severus" ("Triginta capita", P.G., LXXXVI, 1901-16), a short work with many parallels to the preceding one. (7) "Against the frauds of the Apollinarists" ("Adv. fraudes Apollinaristarum", P. (1., LXXXVI, 1947-76), a very important work, the beginning of the discovery of the works of Apollinaris of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> which still occupies the minds of students. It is an examination of certain works attributed to <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, <a href="../cathen/07015a.htm">Gregory Thaumaturgus</a>, and Pope Julius, which are declared to be really by Apollinaris, and <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraudulently</a> attributed to these Fathers by his followers. (8) "Discussions of Sacred Things", by Leontius and John ("De rebus sacris", P.G., LXXXVI, 2017-2100). This is a recension of the second book of the "Sacra Parallela" (collections of texts of the Fathers) of which a version is also attributed to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a> (c. 760). (9) Two <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Leontius of Constantinople (P.G., LXXXVI, 1975-2004), certainly another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Of these works, (1) is certainly genuine, (8) and (9) are certainly not. The "De rebus sacris" was probably composed between 614 and 627. The Leontius of the title is a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that name of <a href="../cathen/13393a.htm">Salamis</a> in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>. Of the others, Loofs thinks that (5) and (6) are fragments of a large work by Leontius Byzantinus, called "Scholia"; (2), (3), and (4) are later works founded on it. (7) is by another (unknown) author, written between 511 and 520. R&uuml;gamer, on the other hand, defends the authenticity in their present form of all these works, except (8) and (9).

<p>Leontius of Byzantium is, in any case, a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> of great importance. Apart from the merit of his controversial work against <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> and <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, his <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelianism</a> marks an epoch in the history of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> philosophy. He has been described as the first of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> (KrumbacherEhrhard, "Byzantinische Litteratur", p. 544.
