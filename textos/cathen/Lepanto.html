<h1>Lepanto</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> name for Naupactos (Naupactus) a <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> of ancient Epirus. The name Naupactus (dockyard) is said to have originated in the traditional building of a fleet there by Heraclidae (Strabo, IX, ix, 7). The site must have been chosen because of the strong position of the hill, the fertile plains of the neighbourhood, and the many streams. Situated on the coast of Loeris, it originally belonged to the Locri Ozolae but was subsequently taken by the Athenians, who in 455 B.C., after the Third Messenian War, established there the Messenian helots, the bitter enemies of <a href="../cathen/14209b.htm">Sparta</a> (Pausanias, IV, xxv, 7; X, xxxviii, 10). After the battle of &AElig;gospotami (404 B.C.), the Spartans captured Naupactus, drove out the Messenians, and restored the town to the Locri Ozolae. Subsequently, it passed in turn to the <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaeans</a>, the Thesbians, and to Philip Macedon, who gave it to the &AElig;tolians; hence it was sometimes called the "city of the &AElig;tolians" (Strabo, IX, iv, 7). For two months Naupactus fiercely resisted the Romans, who under M. Acilius Glabrio finally (191 B.C.) captured the town. Pausanias (X, xxxviii, 12-13) saw there near the sea a <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Poseidon, another of Artemis, a cave dedicated to Aphrodite, and ruins of a <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Aesculapius. During Justinian's reign Naupactus was almost entirely destroyed by an earthquake (Procopius, "Bell. Goth.", IV, xxv).

<p><a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> (Oriens Christianus, II, 197-200) mentions only ten of its Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the first of whom took part in the council of Ephesus (431), but our <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> lists contain ninety-eight names. The <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Naupactus depended on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, as Western Patriarch, until 733, when Leo III the Isaurian annexed it to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. In the early years of the tenth century it had eight suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> (Gelzer, "Ungedruckte . . . Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum", <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1900, p. 557); nine about 1175 under Emporor Manuel Comnenus (Parthey, "Hieroclis Synecdemus", <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1866, p. 121), but only four at the close of the fifteenth century (Gelzer, op. Cit., 635). Annexed to the Greek <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> in 1827, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was suppressed in 1900, and replaced by the See of Acarnania and Naupactia, whose seat is at Missolonghi; the limits of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are identical to those of the name &AElig;tolia and Acarnania. As to the Latin <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Naupactus during the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> occupation, La Quien (Oriens Christ., III, 995) and Eubel (Hierarchia catholica medii aevi, I, 379; II, 222) mention about twenty in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.

<p>Occupied by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in 1498, Lepanto is chiefly celebrated for the victory which the combined <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a>, Spanish, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> fleets, under Don John of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, gained over the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> fleet on 7 Oct., 1571. The latter had 208 galleys and 66 small ships; the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> fleet about the same number. The <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> lost 17 ships and 7500 men; 15 <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> ships were sunk and 177 taken, from 20,000 to 30,000 men disabled, and from 12,000 to 15,000 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> rowers, slaves on the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> galleys, were delivered. Though this victory did not accomplish all that was hoped for, since the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> appeared the very next year with a fleet of 250 ships before Modon and Cape Matapan, and in vain offered battle to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, it was of great importance as being the first great defeat of the infidels on the sea. Held by the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> from 1687 to 1689, and thence by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> until 1827, it became in the latter year part of the new Greek realm. Today Naupactus, chief town of the district in the province of Arcarnania and &AElig;tolia, has 4,500 inhabitants, all Orthodox Greeks. The roadstead is rather small and silted up; the strait connects the Bay of Patras with the Gulf of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>.
