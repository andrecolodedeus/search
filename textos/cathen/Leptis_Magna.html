<h1>Leptis Magna</h1>  

<p>Leptis Magna, a <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> of Tripolitana. Founded by the Sidonians in a fine and fertile country, it was the most important of the three towns which formed the Tripoli Confederation. The remains of the ancient Ph&oelig;nician town are still visible, with the harbour, quays, walls, and inland defence, which make it look like Carthage. This <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> city subsequently became the centre of a Greek city, Neapolis, of which most of the monuments are <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> under sand. Notwithstanding Pliny (Nat. Hist., V, xxviii), who distinguishes Neapolis from Leptis, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, according to Ptolemy, Strabo, and Scyllax, that they should be identified. Leptis allied itself with the Romans in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Jugurtha. Having obtained under <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> the title of <em>civitas</em> it seems at that time to have been administered by Carthaginian magistrates; it may have been a <em>municipium</em> during the first century of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a> and erected by <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> into a colony bearing the name of <a href="../cathen/04125b.htm">Colonia</a> Ulpia Trajana, found on many of its <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>. The birthplace of <a href="../cathen/13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a>, who embellished it and enriched it with several fine monuments, it was taken and sacked in the fourth century by the Libyan tribe of Aurusiani (Ammianus Marcellinus, XXVIII, vi) and has never since completely recovered. It was at that time the seat of the military government of Tripolitana.

<p>When <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Justinian</a> took it from the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> in the sixth century, Leptis Magna was largely in ruins and buried under sand. It was rebuilt, and its walls were raised, their extent being reduced in order more easily to protect the town against the attacks of the Berber tribes dwelling beyond its gates. The duke, or military governor, who again took up his residence there, built public baths and several magnificent buildings; the <a href="../cathen/13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a> palace was restored, and five churches were built (Procopius, "De &aelig;dif.", VI-IV). The massacre of all the Berber chiefs of the Levathes, treacherously ordered by Duke Sergius at Leptis Magna in 543, provoked a terrible insurrection, through which the Romans almost lost <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. Taken in the seventh century by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, who allowed it to be invaded by the sands, Leptis Magna is now only a majestic ruin called Lebda, sixty-two miles east of Tripoli. Besides vague traces of several large buildings, the remains of a vast circus, 380 yards by sixty-six yards, are visible. Five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are recorded: Dioga in 255, Victorinus and Maximus in 393, <a href="../cathen/13411a.htm">Salvianus</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a>, in 411, Calipedes in 484. This town must not be confounded with Leptis Minor, today Lemta in Tunisia.
