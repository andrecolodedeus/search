<h1>Leubus</h1>  

<p>A celebrated ancient <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, situated on the Oder, northwest of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Province of Silesia. The year of foundation is not quite certain, the deed of foundation of 1175, formerly considered genuine, having been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>, but the statement of the old <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> chronicles and Polish <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalists</a>, that Leubus was founded 16 August, 1163, by Duke Boleslaus the Tall, is the most probable one. Formerly the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> were there. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> of Leubus have done a great deal for the cultivation and Germanization of Silesia, which was formerly wilderness, primeval forest, morass and moorland, although their activity has been overrated. The mother-house of Leubus was Pforta. From Leubus itself there sprang the houses of Mogila and Klara Tumba at <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, Heinrichau at M&uuml;nsterberg, and Kamenz at Glatz. Leubus had extensive possessions. In the Hussite <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> with all the buildings was burned to the ground (1432). When it had recovered from these misfortunes, it was severely oppressed by the Dukes of Sagan and M&uuml;nsterberg, and was in their possession for seven years (1492-98), the inmates of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> having fled. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> Andreas Hoffmann (1498-1534) infused new life into the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a> it was occupied by the Swedes in 1632 and pillaged. All the treasures of the church fell into their hands. A few years later they returned once more and carried off the valuable <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, which had taken centuries to collect, to Stettin, where it was afterwards destroyed by lightning. As long as the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> lasted, Leubus was practically a ruin, but after the peace Abbot Arnold (1636-72) restored it in a comparatively short time and embellished the church and buildings. He called in the skilful <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> Michael Willmann, who was employed forty years at Leubus (until his death 1706). Under Arnold and Johann IX (1672-91) <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies also flourished. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> reached its zenith under Ludwig Bauch (1696-1729), under whose rule the enormous and imposing building was erected, which is considered the largest building in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and one of the largest in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The principal <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> is 225 metres long, the wings are 118 metres long. Under Constantine (1733-47) the interior was decorated, the hall of princes and the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> being adorned with extravagant magnificence. In the first Silesian War, and in the Seven Years' War (1740-42 and 1756-63), Leubus was terribly impoverished by the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussians</a> and Austrians, so that it had a <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> of 200,000 Reichsthaler. On 21 Nov., 1810, it was suppressed by the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government and confiscated with its 59 villages and 10 domains. Part of the buildings are now used as a <a href="../cathen/08038b.htm">lunatic asylum</a>, in connexion with which the large and beautiful church is utilized for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship.
