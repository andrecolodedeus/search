<h1>Libellatici, Libelli</h1>  

<p>The <em>libelli</em> were certificates issued to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the third century. They were of two kinds: <ol><li>certificates of conformity, to attest that the holders had conformed to the religious tests required by the edict of <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>; <li>certificates of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, in which the confessors or <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> interceded for the <em><a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsi</a></em> (i.e. those who had <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a>).</ol>

<p>The opprobrious term <em>libellatici</em> is applied only to holders of the former kind. The edict of <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a> (Dec., 249, or Jan., 250), coming as it did after a comparatively long period of peace, frightened many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> into submission. But the methods and extent of submission were of several kinds: the <em><a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsi</a></em> might be: <ul><li><em><a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a></em>, who had entirely abandoned their religion, or <li><em>sacrificati</em>, <em>thurificati</em>, who had taken part in the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> rites, or <li><em>libellatici</em>, who had secured certificates (<em>libelli</em>) of conformity from the proper <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>.</ul>

<p>Three such <em>libelli</em> are extant, all of them of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> origin ("Oxyrhynchus Papyri", IV, 658; Gebhardt, "Acta Martyrum Selecta"). Therein the petitioner declares that he was ever constant in sacrificing to the gods, and has actually performed the test of conformity, in attestation of which he begs the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> commissioners to sign this certificate. However, it seems that the declaration was sometimes accepted for the deed, or the deed itself performed by proxy; and no doubt the document might be bought from amenable commissioners without any declaration of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>.

<p>It was in connexion with the reconciliation of these <em>libellatici</em> as well as other <em><a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsi</a></em> that the <em>libelli pacis</em>, or letters of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, were introduced. The <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsi</a> were in the habit of seeking the intercession of the confessors, who were suffering for the Faith; and the latter would address to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <em>libelli pacis</em> petitioning for the reconciliation of the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a>. The <em>libelli</em> were, however, more than mere recommendations to mercy; the confessors were understood to be petitioning that their own merits should be applied to the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, and procure them a remission of the temporal punishment due to their defection. And this <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> was not simply a remission of the canonical penance; it was believed that it availed before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and remitted the temporal punishment that would otherwise be required after death (<a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, <a href="../fathers/050703.htm">"De Lapsis", ad fin.</a>). This custom does not seem to have been established in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but it was particularly prevalent in <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and was not unknown in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. Even in the time of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, the <em><a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsi</a></em> of Carthage were in the habit of thus appealing to the intercession of the confessors ("Ad Mart.", i; <a href="../fathers/0407.htm"><em>On Pudicity</em> 22</a>). In the letters that <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Saint Cyprian</a> wrote from his place of exile he has frequent occasion to complain of the abuse of the <em>libelli</em>. There was a party of laxists who ignored the necessity of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> sanction, and their leader actually <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> a general <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> to all the <em><a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsi</a></em> (<a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, "Epp.", xxxiv, 23). The confessors themselves seem to have lacked discretion in the petitions they presented. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian's</a> letter to them (ep. xv), couched though it is in the tenderest of terms, begs them to be more judicious, to avoid vague petitions, such as "Let him and his people be received into communion", and not to lend their services to the schemes of the seditious or the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> of traffickers. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> own method of treating the petitions for <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> varied according to circumstances. Ep. xviii contains instructions that the <em><a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsi</a></em> who held such letters should be reconciled in case of sickness. Subsequently, however, owing no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> to the above-mentioned abuses and the need for wider methods, the <em>libelli</em> were not given any special mention in the general conditions of reconciliation (African Councils, I, 38).
