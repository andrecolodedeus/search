<h1>Liber Diurnus Romanorum Pontificum</h1>  

<p>A miscellaneous collection of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> formularies used in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancery until the eleventh century. It contains models of the important official documents usually prepared by the chancery; particularly of letters and official documents in connexion with the death, the election, and the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; the installation of newly elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, especially of the <a href="../cathen/14324a.htm">suburbicarian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; also models for the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the conferring of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> on <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, for the granting of privileges and <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a>, the founding of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, the confirmation of acts by which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> acquired <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, the establishment of private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and in general for all the many decrees called for by the extensive <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> administration. The collection opens with the superscriptions and closing formul&aelig; used in writing to the emperor and empress at Constantinople, the Patricius, the Exarch and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, a king, a consul; to <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. The collection is important both for the history of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and for <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, particularly for the history of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. The formularies and models set down are taken from earlier <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents, especially those of Gelasius I (492-6) and <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory I</a> (590-604).

<p>This collection was certainly compiled in the chancery of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, but probably a comparatively small number of the formularies contained in the extant <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were included at first, the remainder being added from time to time. There is no systematic arrangement of the formularies in the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. In its final form, as seen in the two existing <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> (one codex in the Vatican Archives, and another, originally from <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/01393a.htm">Ambrosian Library</a> at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>), the Liber Diurnus dates back to the eighth century. Concerning the more exact determination of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of its compilation, there is even a still great diversity of opinion. Garnier gives in his edition the year 715. Zaccaria, in his "Dissertationes" (P.L., CV, 119 sqq.), attributes the compilation to the ninth century; Rozi&egrave;re, to whom we owe the first good edition (see below), decides for the period 685 to 751 &mdash; the former date, because <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> Pogonatus (died 685) is mentioned as dead, and the latter, because in 751 Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was conquered by the Lombards and the Byzantine administration at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> came to an end (see Introduction, pp. 25 sqq.). Sickel, however in his "Prolegomena" and in his researches on the Liber Diurnus (see below), has shown that the work possesses by no means a uniform character. He recognizes in it three divisions, the first of which he ascribes to the time of Honorius I (625-38), the second to the end of the seventh century, and the third to the time of <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Hadrian I</a> (772-95). Duchesne (Biblioth&egrave;que de l'Ecole des Chartes, LII, 1891, pp. 7 sqq.) differs from Sickel, and maintains that the original version of most of the formularies, and among them the most important, must be referred to the years after 682, and that only the last formularies (nn. lxxxvi-xcix) were added in the time of <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Hadrian I</a>, though some few of these may have existed at an earlier date. Hartmann defends the views of Sickel (Mitteilungen des Instituts f&uuml;r &ouml;sterreich. Gesch., XIII, 1892, pp. 239 sqq.). Friederich (Sitzungsberichte der bayer. Akademie der Wiss. zu M&uuml;nchen, Phil.-hist. Kl., I, 1890, pp. 58 sqq.) investigated more closely the case of some of the formularies attributed by Sickel to one of the aforesaid periods, and attempted to indicate more nearly the occasions and pontificates to which they belonged. These investigations have established beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the collection had already attained its present form towards the end of the eighth century, though no insignificant portion had been compiled during the seventh century. The Liber Diurnus was used officially in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancery until the eleventh century, after which time, as it no longer corresponded to the needs of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> administration, it gave way to other collections. Twelfth century canonists, like <a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">Ivo of Chartres</a> and Gratian, continued to use the Liber Diurnus, but subsequently it ceased to be consulted, and was finally completely forgotten.

<p><a href="../cathen/07397a.htm">Lucas Holstenius</a> was the first who undertook to edit the Liber Diurnus. He had found one <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of it in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and obtained another from the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Coll&egrave;ge de Clermont at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; but as <a href="../cathen/07397a.htm">Holstenius</a> died in the meantime and his notes could not be found, this edition printed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1650 was withheld from publication, by advice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> censors, and the copies put away in a room at the Vatican. The reason for so doing was apparently formula lxxxiv, which contained the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the newly elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in which the latter recognized the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Sixth General Council</a> and its <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a> against Pope Honorius for his (alleged) <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelism</a>. The edition of <a href="../cathen/07397a.htm">Holstenius</a> was reprinted at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1658; but was again withdrawn in 1662 by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority, though in 1725 <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> permitted the issue of some copies. From the Clermont <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, which has since disappeared, Garnier prepared a new edition of the Liber Diurnus (Paris, 1680), but it is very inaccurate, and contains arbitrary alterations of the text. In his "Museum Italicum" (I, II, 32 sqq.) <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> issued a supplement to this edition of Garnier. From these materials, the Liber Diurnus was reprinted at Basle (1741), at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1762), and by <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> (P.L., CV, Paris, 1851). The first good edition, as stated above, we owe to Eug. de Rozi&egrave;re (Liber Diurnus ou Recueil des formules usit&eacute;es par la Chancellerie pontificale du V<sup>e</sup> au XI<sup>e</sup> si&egrave;cle, Paris, 1869). In the interest of this edition Daremberg and Renan compared Garnier's text with the Vatican <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, then regarded as the only authentic one. From this <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Th. von Sickel prepared a critical edition of the text: "Liber Diurnus Rom. Pont. ex unico codice Vaticano denuo ed." (Vienna, 1889). Just after the appearance of this work, however, Ceriani announced the discovery of a new <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, originally from <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/01393a.htm">Ambrosian Library</a> at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>; towards the end this was more complete than the Vatican <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>. This text was published by Achille Ratti (Milan, 1891).
