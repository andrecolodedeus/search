<h1>Liber Septimus</h1>  

<p>Three canonical collections of quite different value from a legal standpoint are known by this title.

<p>(1) The "Constitutiones Clementis V" or "Clementin&aelig;", not officially known as "Liber Septimus", but so designated by historians and canonists of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and even on one occasion by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, in a letter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, in 1321. This collection was not even considered a "Liber". It was officially <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> in a consistory held at Monteaux near Carpentras (<a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>) on 21 March, 1314, and sent to the Universities of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The death of <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, occurring on 20 April following, gave rise to certain <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> as to the legal force of the compilation. Consequently, <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> by his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Quoniam nulla", of 25 October, 1317, <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> it again as <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, without making any changes in it. Johannes Andre&aelig; compiled its commentary, or <em>glossa ordinaria</em>. It was not an exclusive collection, and did not abrogate the previously existing <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> not incorporated in it (see <a href="../cathen/04391a.htm">CORPUS JURIS CANONICI</a>; <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">PAPAL DECRETALS</a>).

<p>(2) A canonist of the sixteenth century, Pierre Mathieu (Petrus Matth&aelig;us), published in 1690, under the title of "Septimus Liber Decretalium", a collection of canons arranged according to the order of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, containing some <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> of preceding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, especially of those who reigned from the time of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> (1464-71) to that of <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, in 1590. It was an entirely private collection and devoid of scientific value. Some editions of the "Corpus Juris Canonici" (Frankfort, 1590; Lyons 1621 and 1671; B&ouml;hmer's edition, Halle, 1747), contain the text of this "Liber septimus" as an appendix.

<p>(3) The name has been given also to a canonical collection officially known as "Decretales Clementis Pap&aelig; VIII". It owes the name of "Liber Septimus" to Cardinal Pinelli, prefect of the special congregation appointed by <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> to draw up a new <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> code, who, in his <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> notes, applied this title to it. Fagnanus and <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> imitated him in this, and it has retained the name. It was to supply the defect of an official codification of the canon law from the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the publication of the "Clementin&aelig;" (1317), that <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>, about the year 1580 appointed a body of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to undertake the work. In 1587 <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> established the congregation mentioned above. The printed work was submitted to <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, in 1598 for his <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>, which was refused. A new revision undertaken in 1607-08 had a similar fate, the reigning <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, declining to approve the "Liber Septimus" as the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> legal code of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is divided into five books, subdivided into titles and chapters, and contains disciplinary and dogmatic canons of the Councils of Florence, Lateran, and <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, and constitutions of twenty-eight <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> from <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> to <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>. The refusals of <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> are to be attributed, not to the fear of seeing the canons of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> glossed by canonists (which was forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul IV</a>, "Benedictus Deus", confirming the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>), but to the political situation of the day, several states having refused to admit some of the constitutions inserted in the new collection, and also to the fact that the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> had not yet been accepted by the French Government; it was therefore feared that the Governments would refuse to recognize the new code. It seems a mistake, too, to have included in the work decisions that were purely and exclusively dogmatic and as such entirely foreign to the domain of canon law. This collection, which appeared appeared about the end of the sixteenth century, was edited by Fran&ccedil;ois Sentis ("Clementis Pap&aelig; VIII Decretales", Freiburg, 1870).
