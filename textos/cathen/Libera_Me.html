<h1>Libera Me</h1>  

<p>(Domine, de morte aeterna, etc.).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12787a.htm">responsory</a> sung at funerals. It is a <a href="../cathen/12787a.htm">responsory</a> of redundant form, having two versicles ("Tremens factus sum" and "Dies illa"). As in all the Office for the Dead, the verse "Requiem aeternam" takes the place of "Gloria Patri"; then all the first part, down to the first versicle, is repeated. Its form therefore is exceptional, considerably longer than the normal <a href="../cathen/12787a.htm">responsory</a>. It is a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the first <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> singular for mercy at the Last Day. This should no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> be understood as a dramatic substitution; the choir speaks for the dead <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. A great part of our Office for the Dead is made up of such <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> about the Last Day, the meaning of which appears to refer rather to the people who say them than to the dead (the sequence "Dies irae", most of the <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>).

<p>Another dramatic substitution is involved in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of this <a href="../cathen/12787a.htm">responsory</a> (and throughout the Office for the Dead) that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for whom we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> may be saved from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. That question was settled irrevocably as soon as he died. This is one instance of the dramatic displacement or rearrangement of the objective order of things that occurs continually in all rites (compare for instance in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> service the white robe and shining light given after the essential form, in the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> the power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> given after the man has been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> and has concelebrated, the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiclesis</a> in Eastern <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, etc.). The explanation of all these cases is the same. Since we cannot express everything at one instant, we are forced to act and speak as if things really simultaneous followed each other in order. And in the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> all things (including our consecutive <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>) are present at once &#151; <em>nunc stans aeternitas</em>. The <a href="../cathen/12787a.htm">responsory</a> "Libera me" is begun by a cantor and continued by the choir in the usual way (the cantor alone singing the versicles) at the beginning of the "Absolution", that is the service of <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers for the dead</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> said and sung by the bier immediately after the Mass for the Dead. As soon as Mass is over the celebrant exchanges his <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a> for a (black) cope (all the sacred <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of course take off their <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniples</a>) and chants the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> "Non intres in judicium". Then "Libera me" is sung. Meanwhile the celebrant puts <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> into the thurible, assisted by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. During the whole Absolution the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> stands at the head of the bier, facing the altar, with the processional cross.

<p>The ninth <a href="../cathen/12787a.htm">responsory</a> of <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> for the Dead also begins with "Libera me", but continues a different text (Domine, de viis inferni, etc.). This is built up according to the usual arrangement (with "Requiem aeternam" instead of "Gloria Patri"). But on <a href="../cathen/01315b.htm">All Souls' Day</a> (2 November), and whenever the whole Office of nine lessons is said, the "Libera me" of the Absolution is substituted for it. The Vatican Gradual gives the new chant for the "Libera me" after the Mass for the Dead.
