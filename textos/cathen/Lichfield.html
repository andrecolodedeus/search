<h1>Lichfield</h1>  

<p>ANCIENT DIOCESE OF LICHFIELD (LICHFELDENSIS).

<p>This diocese took its rise in the conversion of Mercia by <a href="../cathen/03475a.htm">St. Cedd</a> and his three companions in 652 and subsequent years. One of these was Diuma who was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mercia about 656. Among the successors of Diuma was St. Chad, who fixed his seat at Lichfield, where he built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. As time went on other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were carved out of the Mercian territory &#151; the sees afterwards known as <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>, <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, and Dorchester. But Lichfield, though lessened in territory, grew in political importance until the time of the ascendancy of Mercia under <a href="../cathen/11215c.htm">Offa</a>, when that king determined to raise Lichfield as a rival to Canterbury. At the Council of Chelsea in 785 <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> invested Bishop Higbert of Lichfield with the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">archiepiscopal pallium</a>, giving him <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> authority over <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, Leicester, Lincoln, <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>, and the East Anglian <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Elmham and Dunwich. On the death of <a href="../cathen/11215c.htm">Offa</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> restored the full power of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and in 803 the Council of Clovesho accepted the decision of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. During the ninth century the diocese suffered much from the Danes, and the great Abbey of Repton was sacked. The next step was the gradual conversion of the invaders. In the <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a> that ensued in the Midlands after the Conquest, the estates of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were devastated, and Lichfield itself was so poor a place that after the Synod of 1075, which directed the removal of all sees to walled towns, Bishop Peter fixed on Chester as his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> city, and his successor, Robert de Limesey, transferred his seat to Coventry.

<p>The chapter at Lichfield was nevertheless maintained, and one of the early Norman <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Roger de Clinton, rebuilt its <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> there, re-dedicating it to St. Chad, whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> he there enshrined. Enmity and jealousy, however, marked for many years the relations between the Lichfield secular canons and the Coventry <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and successive episcopal elections were the occasions for fresh quarrels. <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> (1227-41) settled the dispute by arranging that the elections should be made alternately by each chapter. During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the building of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> continued. Though not one of the larger <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, it has many beauties, including the west front and the Lady Chapel, and is altogether exceptional in having three spires. When the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> swept away all <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, the great monastic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of Coventry was destroyed, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was robbed by the king of many manors. The churches were plundered and the shrine of St. Chad in Lichfield <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was violated and stripped. The <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Roland Lee and Richard Sampson, wasted the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Ralph Bayne, who was deprived of the temporalities of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> by Elizabeth and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the house of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Grindal. There he died in November, 1559. The following is the list of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Lichfield, the dates of the Saxon <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> being very <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>:--

<p>In <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> days the Diocese of Lichfield included the counties of Derby, Salop, Stafford, and most of Warwickshire. It was divided into four archdeaconries: Derby, <a href="../cathen/13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a>, Stafford, and Coventry. The arms of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were: party per pale, gules and argent, a cross potent and quadrate in the centre between four crosslets patee of the second and or.
