<h1>Liesborn</h1>  

<p>A former noted <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, founded in 815; suppressed in 1803. It was situated near Beckurn, in the south-eastern part of the district of M&uuml;nster. According to an old tradition the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was established in 785 by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. More probably, however, it was built in 815 by two <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, Bozo and Bardo, whom the register of deaths of Liesborn names as the founders. At first Liesborn was a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. As time passed on the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> grew more and more worldly, so that in 1131 Bishop Egbert of M&uuml;nster expelled them, and installed <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in their place. It was several times besieged by enemies and from the thirteenth century ascetic life steadily declined as the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> increased in wealth. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> became a kind of secular foundation, into which the nobility gained admittance through influence. In 1298 the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> wall divided unto separate <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a>, twenty-two of them full <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a>, and six for boys. The Bursfeld Union successfully worked here also (1465) for the restoration of discipline. To the Union was due the flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of Liesborn in the period of the excellent <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> Heinrich of Cleves (1464-90), and Johann Smalebecker (1490-1522) who restored the buildings and greatly improved the <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> condition of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Monastic life, art, and study flourished again. The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Liesborn influenced other <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, and it succeeded in re-establishing discipline and the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> in several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The beautiful altar-paintings with which Abbot Heinrich adorned the church became famous, but under French administration (1807) they sold for a mere song. The artist is unknown, and the best pictures are now in the National Gallery, London.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Bernard Witte, a warm friend of Humanistic learning, was a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at Liesborn (1490 to about 1534). He wrote a history of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> and a chronicle of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. The period of prosperity, however, did not last long. Abbot Anton Kalthoff (1522-32) adopted the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> and was deposed; Gerlach Westhof (1554-82) favoured the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and involved the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> heavily in <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>; under Johann Rodde (1582-1601) immorality and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> decay again increased. Conditions were still worse during the disorders caused by the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the seventeenth century. It was not until the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> (1648) that any improvement appeared, and then it was only for a short time, for the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the eighteenth century also laid waste Liesborn so that at the time of the suppression there were still several thousand <em>thalers</em> of <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was suppressed 2 May, 1803, and was declared the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Crown. The <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a>, rebuilt 1499-1506, and several monastic buildings, are still standing.
