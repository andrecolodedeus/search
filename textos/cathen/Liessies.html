<h1>Liessies</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near Avesnes, in the <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Diocese of Cambrai</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (Nord), founded about the middle of eighth century and dedicated to <a href="../cathen/08757a.htm">St. Lambert</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> appears to have been destroyed twice in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the ensuing centuries, and was only finally established about the year 1110 by Theodoric of Avesnes and his wife Ada. From this time its continued history is on record, but without any fullness of detail, a list of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> may be found in <a href="../cathen/06350c.htm">"Gallia Christiana"</a>. The chief glory of Liessies is the famous Louis de Blois, who became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> there at the early age of fourteen. In 1530 he was made <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and at once inaugurated his well known series of reforms, which were rendered <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by the gradual decline from strict monastic observance (see <a href="../cathen/02604a.htm">BLOSIUS</a>). After the death of Abbot Blosius the next six <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> seem to have maintained the high state of observance inaugurated by him, but the forty-first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Lambert Bouillon, was of a different type. He is said to have lived extravagantly, exhausted the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> exchequer with lawsuits, and diverted the revenues to the advantage of his nephews and nieces. The illustrious <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a>, then <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> accordingly held a visitation of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in the year 1702 and left certain instructions of which the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> circulated a largely fictitious account. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, however, having secured the changes he desired, refrained from any public disavowal of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> declaration. After Abbot Bouillon's death in 1708 the existence of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> continued smoothly until the final suppression of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1791 the last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Dom Mark Verdier, and his community signed a declaration, as ordered by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 14 October, 1790, in which they protested their earnest desire to remain in religion, but the suppression followed nevertheless. The <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was sold in 1791 and 1792 and the church pillaged and destroyed. The valuable <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> for which the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was famous, which included a series of "religious founders", were burned or dispersed, a few being still to be seen in neighbouring churches.
