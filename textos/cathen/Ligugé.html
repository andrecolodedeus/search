<h1>Ligug&eacute;</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey, in the <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Diocese of Poitiers</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, was founded about the year <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 360, by <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and reputation of the holy founder attracted a large number of disciples to the new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. When however, St. Martin became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> and established the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Marmoutiers a short distance from that city, the fame of Ligug&eacute; declined considerably. Among St. Martin's successors as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Ligug&eacute; may be mentioned St. Savin, who resigned the post of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> to become a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, and Abbot Ursinus, during whose reign the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Defensor compiled the well-known "Scintillarum Liber" printed in P.L., LXXXVIII. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracenic</a> invasion, the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the dukes of Aquitame and the early Carlovingians, and lastly the Norman invasion were a series of disasters that almost destroyed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. By the eleventh century it had sunk to the position of a dependent <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> attached to the Abbey of Maillezais, and finally reached the lowest level as a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em>, One of the commendatory <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a>, Geoffrey d'Estissac, a great patron of literature and the friend of Rabelais, built the existing church, a graceful structure but smaller by far than the ancient basilica which it replaced. In 1607 Ligug&eacute; ceased to be a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and was annexed to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> to which institution it served as a country house until the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in 1762. At the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> the buildings and lands were sold as national <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, the church being used for some time as the Municipal Council chamber. Eventually when the upheaval of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> had subsided, the building was constituted a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church.

<p>In 1849 the famous Mgr Pie, afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>. This <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was the intimate friend of <a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Dom Prosper Gu&eacute;ranger</a>, re-founder of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Congregation of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and in 1852 he established at Ligug&eacute; a colony of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">Solesmes</a>. In 1864 the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> was erected into an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a>, and Dom L&eacute;on Bastide was appointed first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. When, in 1880, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were driven from their <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> as a result of the "Ferry laws", many of them retired under Dom Bourigaud, the successor of Dom Bastide, to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Silos in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> which was saved from extinction by the recruits thus received. Some years later the buildings at Ligug&eacute; were sold to a syndicate, civil in its constitution, by which they were leased to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and community who thus entered their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> once more. Novices now came in considerable numbers and, in 1894, the ancient Abbey of St. Wandrille de Fontenelle in the <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Diocese of Rouen</a> was repeopled by a colony from Ligug&eacute;. In 1902 the community were again driven out by the "Association Laws", and they are now settled in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> at Chevetoigne, in the <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Diocese of Namur</a>. On Dom Bourigaud's resignation in 1907. Dom L&eacute;opold Gaugain was elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, the community now numbers about forty choir <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and ten <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>.
