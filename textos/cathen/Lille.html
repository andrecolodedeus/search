<h1>Lille</h1>  

<p>The ancient capital of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, now the chief town of the D&eacute;partement du Nord in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. A very important religious centre ever since the eleventh century, Lille became in the nineteenth a great centre of industry. With a population of 12,818 in 1789, of 24,300 in 1821, of 140,000 in 1860, and of 211,000 in 1905, it is today the fourth city of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in population. (For the early history of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> at Lille, see <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">ARCHDIOCESE OF CAMBRAI</a>.) The Legend according to which the giant Finard was killed in the seventh century, by Lideric, whose mother, Ermengarde, he held <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, and according to which Lideric founded the dynasty of the counts of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, was invented in the thirteenth century. The first Count of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, as a matter of fact, was Baldwin of the Iron Arm, in the ninth century (see <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">FLANDERS</a>), and nothing certain is known of Lille before the middle of the eleventh century. The city seems to have been founded about that time by Count Baldwin V, and in 1054 it was already so well fortified that Henry III, Emperor of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, did not dare to besiege it. In 1055 Baldwin V laid the foundation stone of the collegiate <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter, which was dedicated in 1066.

<p>One of the oldest chronicles of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> says that the foundation of this collegiate church was the beginning of the prosperity of the town. St. Peters was served by forty canons and had very prosperous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> as early as the end of the eleventh century. About the same time Raimbert, a Nominalist, who taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in St. Peter's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, was in conflict with Odo, a Realist, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Carnbrai but at that time professor at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Notre-Dame de Tournai. Raimbert's <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a>, however, was never carried to the extremes which caused Boseclin's condemnation in 1092 Another teacher in St. Peter's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was the celebrated Gautier de Ch&acirc;tillon (twelfth century), the author of the Alexandreis a Latin epic on Alexander the Great which was used as a substitute for Virgil's work in some of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Connected with the same <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> about the same time were <a href="../cathen/01244e.htm">Alain de Lille</a> surnamed the Universal Doctor (see <a href="../cathen/01244e.htm">ALAIN DE L'ISLE</a>); Adam de la Bass&eacute;e, a canon of the collegiate church who composed beautiful <a href="../cathen/09304a.htm">liturgical chants</a>; Lietbert, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Saint-Ruf, author of a great commentary on the Psalms, "Flores Psalmorum". St Thomas of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard of Clairvaux</a> visited the collegiate church of Lille, and in it Philip the Good, Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, held, in 1481, the first chapter of the Order of the Golden Fleece, founded by him in 1430 for the defence of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. In a neighbouring palace was held the famous "Feast of the Pheasant" (1453). in the midst of which Religion, mounted on an elephant which was led by a giant <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a>, entered the banquet hall to beg aid from the Knights of the Golden Fleece. Jean Mi&eacute;lot, a canon of St. Peter's at Lille, wrote for Philip the Good twenty-two works, including translations, <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> works, and biographies. The most important of these works, "La Vie de sainte Catherine d'Al&eacute;xandrie", was printed later. Miniatures of that period often represent this canon offering Philip a book. It was he who, after the "V&aelig;u du Faisan", translated a work of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Father Brochart, "Advis directif pour faire le passage doultre-mer", and a description of the Holy Land.

<p>About this time the preacher Jean d'Eeckhout. another canon of Lille, author of two celebrated <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> treatises, on the espousals of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin</a>, and on the espousals of <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">God the Son</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, yielded to the prevalent impulse towards <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Holy Land, and died while on his <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, in 1472. Influenced by the same movement, Anseim and John Adorno, members of a distinguished <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> settled at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, made a visit to the Holy Land of which the narrative is preserved in a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> at Lille. John Adorno, on his return, became a canon of Lille and devoted himself to spreading, throughout <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, the devotion to <a href="../cathen/03445a.htm">St. Catherine of Alexandria</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> he had seen on <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a> &mdash; hence the large number of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> works of art having St. Catherine for their subject.

<p>In the thirteenth century the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Note-Dame de la Trill, which stood in the collegiate <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter, drew thither many <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. The reputed <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of 14 June, 1254, are famous. It is not certain from what year of that same century the Confraternity of Note-Dame de la Trill dates; but it is historically certain that. in 1470 Margaret, Countess of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, decreed that every year, on the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> after <a href="../cathen/15058a.htm">Trinity Sunday</a> and for the nine days following, processions commemorating these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> should be held in the city. The fragment of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a> which is still preserved at St-Etienne, Lille, was given to the chapter of St. Peter's by the <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Walter of Courtrai, who was chancellor of the Emperor Baldwin I at Constantinople. From the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, the collegiate <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter was annually the scene of the curious election of the "Bishop of Fools", on the Eve of the Epiphany, and, on the feast of the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Holy Innocents</a>, of the election by the choristers of a "<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the Innocents", who was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> carried in <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a>. Another much frequented religious festival at Lille was that of the "Epinette" (little thorn), the solemnities of which began on <a href="../cathen/12614a.htm">Quinquagesima</a> Sunday and lasted until <a href="../cathen/08737c.htm">Mid-Lent</a>. The feast was instituted in the first half of the thirteenth century shortly after the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at Lille had received from the Countess Jeanne a fragment of the Crown of Thorns; it ceased in 1487, when the burghers began to find the expense too heavy. The veneration of the Mater Dolorosa originated in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> in the fifteenth century. The first treatise on this devotion, which dates from 1494, was the work of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Mieliel Fran&ccedil;ois, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Selimbria, and confessor of <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>, a native of Templemars, near Lille. The chapter of St. Peter's immediately combined this devotion with that of Notre Dame de la Treille, and erected in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter the stations of the Seven Dolours, to be made in the same manner as the Way of the Cross.



<p>The collegiate church also originated some important charitable works. Among these were the <em>Cour Gilson</em>, a row of houses established by Canon Robert Gillesson in the sixteenth century, the rents of which were to be used for works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and charity, the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> of the Grange, founded in the sixteenth century by Canon Jean de Lacu; the "marriage burses", or dowries for poor girls, instituted by Canon Etienne Ru&eacute;lin in the sixteenth century; the "prebends of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>", a fund instituted by Hangouard, dean of the chapter, to enable the aged poor to live with their children or kin without being a burden to them; and an apprenticeship fund for the benefit of young workmen, established by Provost Manare. Very modern <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of assisting the poor were devised and carried out as early as the sixteenth century by the canons of St. Peter's and through the liberality of Jean de Lannoy, the collegiate <em>scholasticus</em>, a mont-de-pi&eacute;t&eacute; was established to lend money free of interest to the needy. The collegiate church, again, hospitably received the English refugees, when the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was raging in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Among its English canons were John Marshall (1534-68), Allen's auxiliary in the foundation of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>. and Gilford (1554-1629), who, in 1603, at the peril of his life performed a mission in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and who died <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>: David Kearney, who in 1603 became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and suffered bitter <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Until the sixteenth century the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of St. Peter's was the only one where Latin and the humanities were taught; the City then opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which was entrusted to <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1592, and where the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> John Silvius taught. The collegiate <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter disappeared with the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>.

<p>After having in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> and modern times followed the destinies of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, which passed from the House of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> to the House of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, the city of Lille became French when it was conquered by <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> in 1667 and fortified by Vauban. In 1792 it heroically resisted the Austrians. During the nineteenth century two manufacturers of Lille, <a href="../cathen/15514a.htm">Philibert Vrau</a> (1829-1905) and Camille Fron-Vrau (1831-1908) laboured to form among the numerous working men of the city a centre of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> activity. With the aid of the Abb&eacute; Bernard, <a href="../cathen/15514a.htm">Philibert Vrau</a> founded, in 1863, the Lille <a href="../cathen/15154a.htm">Union of Prayer</a>, the "Bulletin" of which gradually increased its circulation to 22,000; a 1866 he established the "Cercle de Lille", which for many years held the district <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Congress for the D&eacute;partement du Nord and the Pas de Calais, and in 1871 the lay association for building new churches in the suburbs. <a href="../cathen/15514a.htm">Philibert Vrau</a> and Camille F&eacute;ron Vrau undertook to build a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Notre Dame de la Treille, hoping that. the city of Lille would some day be detached from the <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Diocese of Cambrai</a> and become the seat of a new diocese with Notre Dame de la Treille as its <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In 1885 they established the Corporation of St. Nicholas for spinners and weavers, with an employers' and a working. men's council, and a co-operative fund supported by monthly assessments on both employers and employees.

<p>The Catholic University of Lille, lastly, was the result of their continued and generous efforts. This scheme was presented by <a href="../cathen/15514a.htm">Philbert Vrau</a> in 1873 at the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Congress of the North; the Abb&eacute; Mortier, later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06378a.htm">Gap</a>, and the Abb&eacute; Dehaisnes, known for his writings on the history of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, were pointed to report. on the question. In 1874, in the ancient ball of the Prefecture which had been rented for the purpose by <a href="../cathen/15514a.htm">Philibert Vrau</a>, law courses were opened to the public. The passing of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> on the freedom of higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> (12 July, 1875) hastened the success of the foundation. On 18 Nov., 1875, a complete law course was organized; on 18 Jan., 1877, the four faculties of law <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, letters, and medicine were inaugurated; on 22 Nov., 1879, the cornerstone of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was laid. As early as 1878 it was ascertained that the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of St. Eugenia, attached to the faculty of medicine, had cared for as many as 2448 patients, and that the contributions received for the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> already amounted to 6,473,263 francs (about $1,294,000). <a href="../cathen/15514a.htm">Philibert Vrau</a> also took the initiative in establishing, in 1880, the only professedly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> commercial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for higher industrial studies was established in 1885. As early as 1876 <a href="../cathen/15514a.htm">Philibert Vrau</a> contemplated the foundation of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of arts and crafts at Lille, but it was not until 1898 that the institute was inaugurated under Father Lacoutre, S.J. In 1894 there was added to the faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> a department of social and political <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and lectures are now given every year by the most distinguished <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> savants of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The system of political economy opposed to the intervention of the State in labour affairs &mdash; a system long favoured by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> industriels of Lille &mdash; was gradually overthrown by the teaching given in this department, and Professor Duthoit's "Vers l'organisation professionelle", published in the spring of 1910, finally confirmed the victory of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> social <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> at Lille.

<p>In 1897, following the initiative taken by Cambridge and Oxford, the Catholic University of Lille established a "University Extension" for the organization of lectures by the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> professors throughout the manufacturing centres in the vicinity of Lille. In 1898 the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> organized higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> girls of Lille. In April, 1907, the Conseil G&eacute;n&eacute;ral du Nord suggested the suppression by the state of the freedom of higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and insisted upon ordinances preventing physicians coming from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> faculty of Lille from attending paupers in the D&eacute;partement du Nord at the expense of the State. Before the creation of <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> by the French Government, the Catholic University of Lille presented the first example of these institutions. As early as 1886, M. Lavisse, a professor at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, spoke in high terms of this impressive group of faculties, saying that in centralized <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> it was a distinguished <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of Lille to have been incorporated in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. The faculties of higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> which the State controlled at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> were transferred to Lille in 1888 and raised, six years later, to the rank of a state <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. <a href="../cathen/02352a.htm">Mgr Baunard</a> resigned the rectorship of the Catholic University in Oct., 1908, and was succeeded by Mgr Margerin, who had distinguished himself in 1888 at Fournies by placing himself between the workmen and the fire of the soldiers. Among the noteworthy works of art possessed by the city of Lille is a wax head, preserved in the museum, purchased in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> by Wicar during the Revolution; it is ascribed by this connoisseur to <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>; Alexandre Dumas the younger attributed it to <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo da Vinci</a>; Henry Thode claims that it was an antique modelled after the head of a young Roman girl whose remains were found in 1485; M. Franz Wickhoff, on the other hand, is inclined to regard it as the work of one of the pupils of Victor of <a href="../cathen/04401a.htm">Cortona</a> (end of the seventeenth century or the beginning of the eighteenth), and is of opinion that it is the head of a virgin and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>.
