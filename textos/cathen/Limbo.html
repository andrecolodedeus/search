<h1>Limbo</h1>  

<p>(Late <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>limbus</em>) a word of <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">Teutonic</a> derivation, meaning literally "hem" or "border," as of a garment, or anything joined on (cf. <a href="../cathen/08245a.htm">Italian</a> <em>lembo</em> or <a href="../cathen/05458a.htm">English</a> <em>limb</em>).

<p>In <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> usage the name is applied to (a) the temporary place or state of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just who, although <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purified</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, were excluded from the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> until <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Christ's triumphant ascension into Heaven</a> (the "limbus patrum"); or (b) to the permanent place or state of those unbaptized children and others who, dying without grievous personal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, are excluded from the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> on account of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> alone (the "limbus infantium" or "puerorum").

<p>In <a href="../cathen/05458a.htm">literary</a> usage the name is sometimes applied in a wider and more general sense to any place or state of restraint, confinement, or exclusion, and is practically equivalent to "prison" (see, e.g., Milton, "Paradise Lost," III, 495; Butler, "Hudibras," part II, canto i, and other <a href="../cathen/05458a.htm">English</a> classics). The not unnatural transition from the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05458a.htm">literary</a> usage is exemplified in <a href="../cathen/13748c.htm">Shakespeare</a>, "Henry VIII," act v, sc. 3. In this article we shall deal only with the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> meaning and connotation of the word.
<h2 id="section1"><em>Limbus patrum</em></h2>

<p>Though it can hardly be claimed, on the evidence of extant literature, that a definite and consistent <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the limbus patrum of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Christian tradition</a> was universal among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, it cannot on the other hand be denied that, more especially in the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">extra-canonical writings</a> of the second or first centuries B.C., some such <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> finds repeated expression; and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> references to the subject remove all doubt as to the current Jewish <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Whatever name may be used in <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Jewish literature to designate the abode of the departed just, the implication generally is <ul><li>that their condition is one of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, <li>that it is temporary, and <li>that it is to be replaced by a condition of <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">final and permanent bliss</a> when the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Messianic Kingdom</a> is established.</ul>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> refers by various names and figures to the place or state which <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a> has agreed to call the limbus patrum. In <a href="../bible/mat008.htm#vrs11">Matthew 8:11</a>, it is spoken of under the figure of a banquet "with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of Heaven</a>" (cf. <a href="../bible/luk008.htm#vrs29">Luke 8:29</a>; <a href="../bible/luk014.htm#vrs15">14:15</a>), and in <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs10">Matthew 25:10</a> under the figure of a marriage feast to which the prudent <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> are admitted, while in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of Lazarus and <a href="../cathen/05048a.htm">Dives</a> it is called <a href="../cathen/01055a.htm">"Abraham's bosom"</a> (<a href="../bible/luk016.htm#vrs22">Luke 16:22</a>) and in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words to the penitent thief on <a href="../cathen/03191a.htm">Calvary</a> the name <em>paradise</em> is used (<a href="../bible/luk023.htm#vrs43">Luke 23:43</a>). <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> teaches (<a href="../bible/eph004.htm#vrs9">Ephesians 4:9</a>) that before <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascending into Heaven</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "also descended first into the lower parts of the earth," and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">St. Peter</a> still more explicitly teaches that "being put to death indeed, in the flesh, but enlivened in the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>," <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> went and "preached to those <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that were in prison, which had been some time incredulous, when they waited for the patience of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the days of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>" (<a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#vrs18">1 Peter 3:18-20</a>).

<p>It is principally on the strength of these <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptural</a> texts, harmonized with the general <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">Fall</a> and <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, that <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a> has defended the existence of the limbus patrum as a temporary state or place of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> distinct from <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>. As a result of the <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">Fall</a>, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> was closed against <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Actual possession of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> was postponed, even for those already <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purified</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, until the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a> should have been historically completed by <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Christ's visible ascendancy</a> into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. Consequently, the just who had lived under the Old Dispensation, and who, either at death or after a course of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatorial discipline</a>, had attained the <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> required for entrance into <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, were obliged to await the coming of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Incarnate Son of God</a> and the full accomplishment of His visible earthly mission. Meanwhile they were "in prison," as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">St. Peter</a> says; but, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> own words to the penitent thief and in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of Lazarus clearly imply, their condition was one of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, notwithstanding the postponement of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">higher bliss</a> to which they looked forward. And this, substantially, is all that <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a> teaches regarding the limbus patrum.
<h2 id="section2"><em>Limbus infantium</em></h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> contains no definite statement of a positive kind regarding the lot of those who die in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> without being burdened with grievous personal guilt. But, by insisting on the absolute necessity of being "<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">born again of water</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs5">John 3:5</a>) for entry into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of Heaven</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">BAPTISM</a>, subtitle <em>Necessity of Baptism</em>), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> clearly enough implies that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are born into this world in a state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> teaching to the same effect is quite explicit (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs12">Romans 5:12 sqq.</a>). On the other hand, it is clear from <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> and <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a> that the means of regeneration provided for this life do not remain available after death, so that those dying unregenerate are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> excluded from the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> (<a href="../bible/joh009.htm#vrs4">John 9:4</a>, <a href="../bible/luk012.htm#vrs40">Luke 12:40</a>, <a href="../bible/luk016.htm#vrs19">16:19 sqq.</a>, <a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs10">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>; see also <a href="../cathen/01599a.htm">APOCATASTASIS</a>). The question therefore arises as to what, in the absence of a clear positive <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> on the subject, we ought in conformity with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles to believe regarding the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> lot of such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Now it may confidently be said that, as the result of centuries of speculation on the subject, we ought to believe that these <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> enjoy and will <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> enjoy a state of perfect natural <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; and this is what <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> usually mean when they speak of the limbus infantium, the "children's limbo."

<p>The best way of justifying the above statement is to give a brief sketch of the history of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> opinion on the subject. We shall try to do so by selecting the particular and pertinent facts from the general history of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> speculation regarding the Fall and <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, but it is only right to observe that a fairly full knowledge of this general history is required for a proper appreciation of these facts.
<h3 id="A">Pre-Augustinian tradition</h3>

<p>There is no evidence to prove that any <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> or <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Father</a> before <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> ever taught that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> of itself involved any severer penalty after death than exclusion from the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>, and this, by the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> at least, was always regarded as being strictly <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. Explicit references to the subject are rare, but for the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> generally the statement of <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a> may be taken as representative: <blockquote>It will happen, I believe . . . that those last mentioned [infants dying without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>] will neither be admitted by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">just judge</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> nor condemned to suffer <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">punishment</a>, since, though unsealed [by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>], they are not wicked. . . . For from the fact that one does not merit punishment it does not follow that one is worthy of being <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, any more than it follows that one who is not worthy of a certain <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> deserves on that account to be punished. [<a href="../fathers/310240.htm"><em>Oration</em> 40, no. 23</a>]</blockquote> Thus, according to <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory</a>, for children dying without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and excluded for want of the "seal" from the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">"honor"</a> or gratuitous favor of <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">seeing God face to face</a>, an intermediate or neutral state is admissible, which, unlike that of the personally wicked, is free from positive punishment. And, for the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> opposes infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> on the ground that infants are innocent, while <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> explains that <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> is rather an inclination to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than guilt in the strict sense, and that it need occasion no fear at the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgement</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/01406a.htm">Ambrosiaster</a> teaches that the "second death," which means condemnation to the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell of torment of the damned</a>, is not incurred by <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">Adam's sin</a>, but by our own. This was undoubtedly the general <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> before <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine's</a> time.


<h3 id="B">Teaching of St. Augustine</h3>

<p>In his earlier writings <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> himself agrees with the common <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a>. Thus in <em>De libero arbitrio</em> III, written several years before the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> controversy, discussing the fate of unbaptized infants after death, he writes: "It is superfluous to inquire about the <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> of one who has not any <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a>. For one need not hesitate to hold that <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> may be neutral as between good conduct and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and that as between <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">reward</a> and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">punishment</a> there may be a neutral sentence of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">judge</a>." But even before the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> controversy <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> had already abandoned the lenient <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">traditional</a> view, and in the course of the controversy he himself condemned, and persuaded the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> (418) to condemn, the substantially identical <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> teaching affirming the existence of "an intermediate place, or of any place anywhere at all (<em>ullus alicubi locus</em>), in which children who pass out of this life unbaptized live in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>" (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a> 102). This means that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">African</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> believed that unbaptized infants share in the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">common positive misery of the damned</a>, and the very most that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> concedes is that their punishment is the mildest of all, so mild indeed that one may not say that for them non-existence would be preferable to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">existence</a> in such a state (<a href="../fathers/15011.htm"><em>Of Sin and Merit</em> I.21</a>; <em>Contra Jul.</em> V, 44; etc.). But this <a href="../cathen/02091a.htm">Augustinian teaching</a> was an innovation in its day, and the history of subsequent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> speculation on this subject is taken up chiefly with the reaction which has ended in a return to the pre-Augustinian <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a>.
<h3 id="C">Post-Augustinian teaching</h3>

<p>After enjoying several centuries of undisputed supremacy, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine's</a> teaching on <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> was first successfully challenged by <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> (d. 1109), who maintained that it was not <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a>, but the privation of original justice, that constituted the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the inherited <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (<em>De conceptu virginali</em>). On the special question, however, of the punishment of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> after death, <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> was at one with <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> in holding that unbaptized children share in the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">positive sufferings of the damned</a>; and <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> was the first to rebel against the severity of the <a href="../cathen/02091a.htm">Augustinian tradition</a> on this point. According to him there was no guilt (<em>culpa</em>), but only punishment (<em>poena</em>), in the proper notion of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>; and although this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was rightly condemned by the <a href="../cathen/12164c.htm">Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> in 1140, his teaching, which rejected material torment (<em>poena sensus</em>) and retained only the pain of loss (<em>poena damni</em>) as the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> (<em>Comm. in Rom.</em>), was not only not condemned but was generally accepted and improved upon by the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>. <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, the Master of the Sentences, popularized it (<em>Sent.</em> II, xxxiii, 5), and it acquired a certain degree of official authority from the letter of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Arles, which soon found its way into the <a href="../cathen/04391a.htm">"Corpus Juris"</a>. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent's</a> teaching is to the effect that those dying with only <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> on their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will suffer "no other pain, whether from material fire or from the worm of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, except the pain of being deprived forever of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>" (<em>Corp. Juris</em>, Decret. l. III, tit. xlii, c. iii &#151; <em>Majores</em>). It should be noted, however, that this <em>poena damni</em> incurred for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> implied, with <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> and most of the early <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>, a certain degree of spiritual torment, and that <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> was the first great teacher who broke away completely from the <a href="../cathen/02091a.htm">Augustinian tradition</a> on this subject, and relying on the principle, derived through the <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as such with all its powers and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> was unaffected by the <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">Fall</a> (<em>quod naturalia manent integra</em>), maintained, at least virtually, what the great majority of later <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> have expressly taught, that the limbus infantium is a place or state of perfect natural <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.

<p>No reason can be given &#151; so argued the <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Angelic Doctor</a> &#151; for exempting unbaptized children from the material torments of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">Hell</a> (<em>poena sensus</em>) that does not hold good, even a fortiori, for exempting them also from internal spiritual suffering (<em>poena damni</em> in the subjective sense), since the latter in reality is the more grievous penalty, and is more opposed to the <em>mitissima poena</em> which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> was willing to admit (<em>De Malo</em>, V, art. iii). Hence he expressly denies that they suffer from any "interior affliction", in other words that they experience any pain of loss (<em>nihil omnino dolebunt de carentia visionis divinae</em> &#151; "In Sent.", II, 33, q. ii, a. 2). At first ("In Sent.", loc. cit.), <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> held this absence of subjective suffering to be compatible with a <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">consciousness</a> of objective loss or privation, the resignation of such <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to the ways of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">God's providence</a> being so perfect that a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what they had lost through no fault of their own does not interfere with the full enjoyment of the natural goods they possess. Afterwards, however, he adopted the much simpler psychological explanation which denies that these <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> have any knowledge of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> destiny they have missed, this knowledge being itself <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, and as such not included in what is naturally due to the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (<em>De Malo</em> loc. cit.). It should be added that in <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas'</a> view the limbus infantium is not a mere negative state of immunity from suffering and sorrow, but a state of positive <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of him proportionate to nature's capacity.

<p>The teaching of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> was received in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, almost without opposition, down to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> period. The very few <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> who, with <a href="../cathen/07018a.htm">Gregory of Rimini</a>, stood out for the severe <a href="../cathen/02091a.htm">Augustinian</a> view, were commonly designated by the opprobrious name of <em>tortores infantium</em>. Some writers, like <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a> (<em>De triumpho crucis</em>, III, 9) and Catharinus (<em>De statu parvulorum sine bapt. decedentium</em>), added certain details to the current teaching &#151; for example that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of unbaptized children will be united to glorious bodies at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">Resurrection</a>, and that the renovated earth of which <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">St. Peter</a> speaks (<a href="../bible/2pe003.htm#vrs13">2 Peter 3:13</a>) will be their happy dwelling place for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> generally, but more especially the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, in reviving <a href="../cathen/02091a.htm">Augustinian teaching</a>, added to its original harshness, and the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> followed on the same lines. This reacted in two ways on <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> opinion, first by compelling attention to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> historical situation, which the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> had understood very imperfectly, and second by stimulating an all-round opposition to <a href="../cathen/02091a.htm">Augustinian</a> severity regarding the effects of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>; and the immediate result was to set up two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> parties, one of whom either rejected <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> to follow the authority of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> or vainly try to reconcile the two, while the other remained faithful to the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. The latter party, after a fairly prolonged struggle, has certainly the balance of success on its side.

<p>Besides the professed advocates of <a href="../cathen/02091a.htm">Augustinianism</a>, the principal <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> who belonged to the first party were <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, and the chief ground of their opposition to the previously prevalent <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> view was that its acceptance seemed to compromise the very principle of the authority of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a>. As students of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history</a>, they felt bound to admit that, in excluding unbaptized children from any place or state even of natural <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and condemning them to the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">Hell</a>, <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a>, and later <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">African</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, like <a href="../cathen/06316a.htm">Fulgentius</a> (<em>De fide ad Petrum</em>, 27), intended to teach no mere private opinion, but a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>; nor could they be satisfied with what <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>, like <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> and <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a>, said in reply to this difficulty, namely that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> had simply been guilty of exaggeration ("respondit Bonaventura dicens quod Augustinus excessive loquitur de illis poenis, sicut frequenter faciunt sancti" &#151; Scots, <em>In Sent.</em>, II, xxxiii, 2). Neither could they accept the explanation which even some modern <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> continue to repeat: that the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> doctrine condemned by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> (see e.g., <a href="../fathers/15082.htm"><em>On the Soul and its Origin</em> II.17</a>) consisted in claiming <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, as opposed to natural, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> for those dying in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, <em>De amiss. gratiae</em>, vi, 1; <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a>, <em>De Deo</em>, IX, xi; De Rubeis, <em>De Peccat. Orig.</em>, xxx, lxxii). Moreover, there was the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of those dying in actual mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> alone go down at once (<em>mox</em>) into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">Hell</a>, to be punished, however, with widely different penalties."

<p>It is clear that <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> found the situation embarrassing, being unwilling, as he was, to admit that <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> generally were in conflict with what <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and other <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> considered to be <em>de fide</em>, and what the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> seemed to have taught definitively. Hence he names Catharinus and some others as revivers of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, as though their teaching differed in substance from the general teaching of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">School</a>, and tries in a milder way to refute what he concedes to be the view of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (op. cit., vi-vii). He himself adopts a view which is substantially that of <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> mentioned above; but he is obliged to do violence to the text of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and other <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> in his attempt to explain them in conformity with this view, and to contradict the principle he elsewhere insists upon that "<a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> does not destroy the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> but only the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>." (op. cit., iv).

<p><a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a>, on the other hand, did not try to explain away the obvious meaning of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and his followers, but, in conformity with that teaching, condemned unbaptized children to the sensible pains of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">Hell</a>, maintaining also that this was a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>.

<p>Neither of these <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, however, succeeded in winning a large following or in turning the current of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> opinion from the channel into which <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> had directed it. Besides <a href="../cathen/01296c.htm">Natalis Alexander</a> (<em>De peccat. et virtut</em>, I, i, 12), and Estius (<em>In Sent.</em>, II, xxxv, 7), <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine's</a> chief supporter was <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, who vainly tried to induce <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> to condemn certain propositions which he extracted from a posthumous work of <a href="../cathen/13748b.htm">Cardinal Sfrondati</a> and in which the lenient <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic</a> view is affirmed. Only professed <a href="../cathen/02091a.htm">Augustinians</a> like <a href="../cathen/11103a.htm">Noris</a> and <a href="../cathen/02522a.htm">Berti</a>, or out-and-out <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> like the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12117a.htm">Pistoia</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/12116c.htm">famous diocesan synod</a> furnished eighty-five propositions for condemnation by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> (1794), supported the harsh teaching of <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a>. The twenty-sixth of these propositions repudiated "as a <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> fable the existence of the place (usually called the children's limbo) in which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of those dying in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> are punished by the pain of loss without any pain of fire"; and this, taken to mean that by denying the pain of fire one thereby necessarily postulates a middle place or state, involving neither guilt nor penalty, between the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a>, is condemned by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as being "<a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and rash and as slander of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Catholic schools</a>" (Denz. 526).

<p>This condemnation was practically the death-knell of extreme <a href="../cathen/02091a.htm">Augustinianism</a>, while the mitigate <a href="../cathen/02091a.htm">Augustinianism</a> of <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> and <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> had already been rejected by the bulk of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. <a href="../cathen/14319a.htm">Suarez</a>, for example, ignoring <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine's</a> protest, continued to teach what Catharinus had taught &#151; that unbaptized children will not only enjoy perfect natural <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, but that they will <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">rise with immortal bodies</a> at the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">last day</a> and have the renovated earth for their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> abode (<em>De vit. et penat.</em>, ix, <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. vi, n. 4); and, without insisting on such details, the great majority of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> have continued to maintain the general <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that the children's limbo is a state of perfect natural <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, just the same as it would have been if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had not established the present <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, on the other hand, that some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> have stood out for some kind of compromise with <a href="../cathen/02091a.htm">Augustinianism</a>, on the ground that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself was wounded and weakened, or, at least that certain natural <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> (including the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">felicity</a>) were lost in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">Fall</a>. But these have granted for the most part that the children's limbo implies exemption, not only from the pain of sense, but from any positive spiritual anguish for the loss of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>; and not a few have been willing to admit a certain degree of natural <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in limbo. What has been chiefly in dispute is whether this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is as perfect and complete as it would have been in the hypothetical state of pure <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and this is what the majority of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> have affirmed.

<p>As to the difficulties against this view which possessed such weight in the eyes of the eminent <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> we have mentioned, it is to be observed: <ul><li>we must not confound <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine's</a> private authority with the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> authority of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and <li>if allowance be made for the confusion introduced into the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> controversy by the want of a clear and explicit conception of the distinction between the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a> one can easily understand why <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> were practically bound to condemn the <em>locus medius</em> of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> himself was inclined to deny this distinction altogether, although the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> had already developed it pretty fully, and although some of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> had a glimmering of it (see Coelestius in August., <em>De Peccat. Orig.</em>, v), they based their claim to natural <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> for unbaptized children on a denial of the Fall and <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, and identified this state of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> with the "life eternal" of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. <li>Moreover, even if one were to admit for the sake of argument that this <a href="../cathen/03287a.htm">canon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a> (the <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authenticity</a> of which cannot be reasonably <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>) acquired the force of an ecumenical <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">definition</a>, one ought to interpret it in the light of what was understood to be at issue by both sides in the controversy, and therefore add to the simple <em>locus medius</em> the qualification which is added by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> when, in the <a href="../cathen/04321a.htm">Constitution</a> <a href="../cathen/02068b.htm">"Auctoreum Fidei"</a>, he speaks of "locum illium et statum medium expertem culpae et poenae." <li>Finally, in regard to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, it is incredible that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Fathers</a> there assembled had any intention of defining a question so remote from the issue on which <a href="../cathen/15132a.htm">reunion</a> with the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greeks</a> depended, and one which was recognized at the time as being open to free discussion and continued to be so regarded by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> for several centuries afterwards. What the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">council</a> evidently intended to deny in the passage alleged was the postponement of final awards until the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">day of judgement</a>. Those dying in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> are said to descend into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">Hell</a>, but this does not necessarily mean anything more than that they are excluded <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> from the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>. In this sense they are damned; they have failed to reach their <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> destiny, and this viewed objectively is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> penalty. Thus the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, however literally interpreted, does not deny the possibility of perfect subjective <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> for those dying in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, and this is all that is needed from the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> viewpoint to justify the prevailing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> notion of the children's limbo, while from the standpoint of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>, as <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a> pointed out long ago, no harsher view can be reconciled with a worthy concept of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and other <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">attributes</a>.</ul>
