<h1>Limerick</h1>  

<p>(LIMERICENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; includes the greater part of the County of Limerick and a small portion of Clare, and has an area, approximately, of about 500,000 acres. It corresponds with the ancient territory of Hy Fidhgheinte. <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> visited the district, and was followed in the work of converting the natives by <a href="../cathen/13713a.htm">St. Senan</a>, who lived in the sixth century and who was at one time <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Scattery Island. In the same century lived St. Munchin, the patron of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, who established a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Mungret. This <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> became so famous that at one time it had 1,500 students. An offshoot from Mungret was a hermitage at Kill-Munchin, near Limerick. Thither St. Munchin retired, and there he spent his closing years, and, no doubt, from this hermitage and from Mungret the spiritual needs of the surrounding district were supplied. But as yet there was no city of Limerick, and no diocese till after the Danes came. Quick to discern the advantageous position of the place for trade and commerce, they settled there in the ninth century, and from this as their stronghold they oppressed the natives around and plundered the religious establishments along the Shannon. They were severely punished in the end of the tenth century by Brian Boroihme, who expelled them from the city, and they were readmitted only as subjects and tributaries of the kings of Thomond. Gradually they became <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, though they still disliked the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, and had their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at Limerick <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and subject to him.

<p>It is said there was a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Limerick about 1050, but his name and acts are unknown. We do <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, however, that there was a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at Limerick about 1100, a remarkable man, Gillebert by name. <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> at Bangor, he had been <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> there, and then, having travelled abroad, he met Anselm, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, at <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>. Perhaps it was through Anselm's influence that he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Limerick and also <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a>. Probably it was under Anselm's advice that he endeavoured to introduce unity of liturgy in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church, instead of the bewildering diversity of Offices and Masses which prevailed. He presided at the Synod of Rathbreasail (1118), where the number and limits of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were determined, when Limerick itself, freed from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, was made subject to Cashel as the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Munster. Gillebert resigned his position as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> delegate in 1139 and in the following year died. His immediate successors in the See of Limerick were all Danes; then came Donat O'Brien, of the royal House of Thomond. During his episcopate (1179-1207) the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Mary was built, a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter was set up, and Scattery Island was united to Limerick. Meantime the city of Limerick, alternately ruled by native and Anglo-Norman, was in 1199 taken possession of by de Burgh, who soon ruled with the power of an independent prince. Under Anglo-Norman rule English influences prevailed, and for two centuries the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> appointed were English, or of English descent. During that period the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> chapter were enlarged, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was divided into deaneries. One <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Limerick, in 1351, ruled <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> for a short period as lord deputy; and another had a serious quarrel with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, whom he drove out of Limerick by force. This militant <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1400 and was succeeded by a very able man, Cornelius O'Dea, a descendant of one of the ancient Dalcassian chiefs. His <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> and <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>, both beautifully ornamented, still exist. His successors, like his predecessors, were of the Anglo-Irish stock; nor did anything noteworthy occur during their rule until the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, and then, though a Limerick <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, William Casey, accepted from Edward VI the position of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, both <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and Anglo-Irish united in rejecting the new doctrines.

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of Elizabeth the diocese suffered much, nor did any city rejoice more sincerely than Limerick at the death of the queen. The city was again prominent in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of the seventeenth century. The <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> was present in its <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, in 1646, when a <a href="../cathen/14468c.htm">Te Deum</a> was sung for the victory of Benburb; and when the city was captured, in 1651, by Ireton, after a most heroic defence, one of those specially excluded from mercy was the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He managed, however, to escape, and died at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, in 1654. For nearly twenty years subsequently Limerick had no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; and then came the partial toleration under Charles II and the fleeting triumph under James II, followed by the Jacobite <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, which, in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, was mainly a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of religion. The Treaty of Limerick, which ended the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and was supposed to have secured toleration for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, was soon shamefully broken, and in the eighteenth century Limerick &mdash; city and diocese &mdash; experienced to the full the horrors of the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a>. From 1702 to 1720 there was no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but after that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the episcopal succession was regularly maintained. Shut out from every position of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> or emolument, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were prohibited from dwelling within the city, unless registered, and as late as 1744 there was no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church within the city walls. Gradually, however, the old religion gained ground. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, defying the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, settled in Limerick and soon outnumbered the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and being free to engage in trade, they amassed wealth and built churches. In 1805, when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Dr. Young, undertook the building of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> college, he had no difficulty in getting sufficient funds for the purpose. Dr. Young was one of those who refused to subscribe to the episcopal resolution of 1799 favouring the veto, and he denounced the project in 1808, when it was sought to have it revived, His successor, Dr. Tuohy, was equally vigorous (1814) in condemnation of the letter of Monsignor Quarantotti. One of Dr. Tuohy's most notable acts was to introduce the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> into the city. He died in 1828, and was succeeded by Dr. Ryan, who died in 1864. The long episcopate of the latter was marked by the erection of many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, including the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. John, the foundation-stone of which was laid in 1856. Convents, also, were multiplied, and where, in 1825, there was but one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> throughout the whole diocese, at Dr. Ryan's death there were in Limerick City alone five <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, these including the Good Shepherd, Presentation, and Mercy orders. And the good work of building churches, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> was carried on with equal energy by Dr. Ryan's successor, Dr. Butler (1864-86).

<p>The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Dr. Edward Thomas O'Dwyer, born in 1842, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth</a>, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1867, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1886, an eloquent and fearless man, always listened to with respect on public questions. Among eminent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> connected with the diocese may be named the poets <a href="../cathen/07032a.htm">Gerald Griffin</a>, Sir Aubrey de Vere, Bart., and his son Sir Aubrey Thomas de Vere, the second baronet. In 1910 the diocese contained 48 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 46 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 2 administrators, 60 <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a>, 7 professors, 115 secular and 54 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, 94 district churches, 12 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> with 144 religious living in community, 4 <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">monastic houses</a> with 38 religious living in community. In 1901 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was 111,170.
