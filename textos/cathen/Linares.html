<p>[Or MONTEREY or NUEVO LE&Oacute;N; ARCHDIOCESE OF (DE LINARES)]

<p>In 1777, at the request of Charles III of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> erected the episcopal See of Linares as suffragan of the <a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">Archdiocese of Mexico</a>. Its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Fra Antonio di Gesu, O.E.M. For reasons of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was raised to <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> rank by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 23 June, 1891, with San Luis Potosi, <a href="../cathen/13404b.htm">Saltillo</a>, and Tamaulipas, or Ciudad de Victoria, as suffragans. Monterey, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> town and residence of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, is the capital of the State of Nuevo Le&oacute;n, Mexico. It is situated about 1600 feet above sea-level, and in 1900 it had a population of 62,266, ranking as sixth city in the republic. Its streets are handsome, well paved and clean, and the suburbs are famous for the beauty of their gardens and orchards. The principal buildings include the fine <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, a spacious <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and medicine, and elaborate public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> where <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> is free and compulsory, as it is throughout the republic, though the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> on this head cannot always be enforced. Owing to improved railway facilities the trade of Monterey is very active, as it lies in the heart of a rich agricultural district, and the neighbourhood abounds in silver mines and metalliferous ores. The town was founded by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> in 1581 and long bore the name of <a href="../cathen/09177a.htm">Le&oacute;n</a>. In September, 1846, during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and Mexico, General Taylor with 6700 men assaulted Monterey, which was defended by General Ampudia and 10,000 Mexicans. It capitulated on 24 September, and the battle of Monterey is famous owing to the very liberal terms of capitulation granted by General Taylor.

<p>The town of Linares from which the archdiocese derives its <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> name is situated on the left bank of the River Tigris about fifty miles from Monterey. The population of the archdiocese is 327,937, and includes the whole of the State of Nuevo Le&oacute;n, an area of 23,592 sq. miles.

<p>The chapter consists of a dean and four canons: there are eighty <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, and seventy-five churches: the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> contains twenty students. The present <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> is Rt. Rev. Leopold Ruiz y Fl&oacute;rez, born at Amealco in the Diocese of Quer&eacute;taro, 13 November, 1865, appointed to Le&oacute;n 1 October, 1900, and transferred to Monterey 14 September, 1907. He succeeded Archbishop Garefa Zambrano, a native of Monterey who had occupied the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> from 19 April, 1900. The See of Linares was originally in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>, and among the members of that order who succeeded its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Fray Antonio de Jes&uacute;s, were Fray R.J. Verger (1782-1791); Andrew Ambrose de Llanos y Valdes (1791-1801); Prima Feliciano Mann di Tamaros (1801-1817); Jos. Ign. de Aranciva (1817-1831); Jos&eacute; de Jes&uacute;s (1831-1848). In the archdiocese there is 1 college with 50 students; 2 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> under the care of the Brothers of Mary with 250 boys; 2 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (<a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>), 400 pupils; 3 academies (Sisters of the Incarnate Word), 230 pupils; 2 academies (Salesian Sisters), 190 pupils; 1 academy, the Religious of the Sacred heart, 30 pupils; 7 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>; 1 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>; 1 home for the aged. Population practically all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>.
