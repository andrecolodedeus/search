<h1>Lippe</h1>  

<p>One of the Confederate States of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. The occasional use of the designation "Lippe Detmold" so called after the chief town, to distinguish it from Schaumberg Lippe, is legally inaccurate. It comprises 469 sq. miles and consists of a larger division lying between the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Provinces of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> and <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, including the ancient Countships of Lippe, Schwatonberg, and Sternberg and, in addition, of the three exclaves of Grevenhagen, Lipperode, and Cappel, lying in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> territory. The principality originated as an immediate suzerainty of the twelfth century, belonging to the lords of Lippe who, in 1529, were counts of the empire. In 1807, by taking part in the Rhenish Confederation the country achieved independence and at the same time became a principality. Since 1815 it had belonged to the German Confederation. In the German War of 1866 Lippe sided with <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and became a part of the North German Confederation, and in 1871 of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. A contest for the throne which had lasted for years was finally settled in 1905, since when Leopold IV (b. 1871) has been reigning prince. In the census of 1 December, 1905, the returns showed 145,577 inhabitants of whom 5,481 were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 139,127 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; 229 other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; 735 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and five members of other <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> increased from 2.4% to 3.8% of the population between 1871 and 1905.

<p>From the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the greater part of the country has belonged to the <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Diocese of Paderborn</a>, smaller portions to Minden and Cologne. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> obtained its first foothold in Lemgo, at that time the most important town in the principality. The ruler, Simon V, in vain endeavoured to suppress the new doctrines. His son and successor, Bernard VIII (1536-63), a minor, was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> a <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>. He forced a <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> ritual upon the country in 1538. Simon VI (1563-1613) confirmed the reformed doctrines (<a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>) in 1605, which ever since then have prevailed in the country. Only the city of Lemgo remained <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>, in spite of a struggle carried on for ten years with great bitterness between the princes and the city. During the last decade of the nineteenth century, however, the number of <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, even in Lemgo, has exceeded that of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>. After the Peace of Augsburg in 1555 by which religious matters were settled, the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in Lippe was substantially accomplished. In spite of the axiom "cujus regio, ejus religio", and of much <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and many struggles, there remained a small number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Lippe all through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, notably a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Falkenhagen established in 1228 and belonging first to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, then to the <a href="../cathen/15644b.htm">Williamites</a>, and since 1432 to the <a href="../cathen/08671a.htm">Knights of the Cross</a>. It was confiscated in 1596, though its possessions fell to the <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and only after the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">Papal suppression of the order</a>, to the reigning house. With the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, particularly Father T&ouml;nnemann, the confessor of Charles IV, the reigning count in 1720 obtained the rank of prince, but he did not assume this title because the exchequer could not defray the dues, notwithstanding the fact that, through Father T&ouml;nnemann's exertions, they were reduced from 20,000 to 5773 gulden. The letters patent granting the princely title were not redeemed until 1789.

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> community grew up in Lemgo in the eighteenth century. Here in 1774 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were given the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to practise their religion privately, and in 1786 openly, though under many restrictions. After 1672, when the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the neighbouring Countship of Ravensburg, which had belonged since 1609 to Brandenburg-Prussia, received their right to public worship, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> from Bielefeld took charge of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Lippe, though able to perform religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> only in secret. Nominally the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (as well as <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>) were allowed free practice of their religion and given full political and civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, through their country's participation in the Rhenish (1807) and the German (1815) Confederations. As a matter of fact, the situation remained unchanged. The control of livings exercised by the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> continued in force. In 1821 the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Papal Bull</a> "De salute animarum", made over to the <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">See of Paderborn</a> the Lippian <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Cappel, Lipperode, and Lippstadt, which had previously belonged to Cologne without producing any ensuing agreement with the State. As a result of this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> continued as he had formerly done, in spite of numerous protests from the Government, to interest himself in all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the country, whose number had greatly increased through immigration.

<p>In the sovereign edict of 9 March, 1854, owing in no small degree to the fairmindedness of the first cabinet minister, Laurenz Hannibal Fischer, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was placed on an equality with the state <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> religion. The <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> obtained the same status on 15 March, 1854. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> were recognized. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> presented the livings, though the sovereign could reject an unacceptable candidate. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was obliged to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance to the prince and his dynasty. In <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> the religion in which children were to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> was settled by agreement between the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. Should nothing be discussed or decided in the marriage settlements, the children without regard to sex must be brought up in the father's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. In order to elucidate this measure beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, the State passed the ordinance of 7 October, 1857, which decreed that ante-nuptial agreements or promises were, from a legal standpoint, null and void. The <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> have resulted in a larger number of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> than of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children. In other respects the legislation concerning marriage corresponds throughout to that in the civil code of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. With regard to sepulture, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are free to use the general cemeteries or open special ones for themselves. If <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have obtained right of sepulture in a non-Catholic cemetery, the use of the liturgy of their Church is permitted, but if they have not this right notice must be given to the evangelical <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, and permission obtained. To the five <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Detmold, with the subordinate <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Horn, Cappel (founded in 784 by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>), Falkenhagen, Lemgo, and Schwalenberg, were added in 1888, the three <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Lage, Lipperode, and Salzuflen. The entire eight were united in 1892 to the deanery of Detmold, presided over by ten <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p>Over and above its <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Falkenhagen, which are based on civil claims, the State pays 300 marks additional salary from the treasury of the confiscated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and institutions to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> at Lemgo only. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> is regulated by the civil code of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, and the Lippian <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>. The only <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community is that of St. Elizabeth's Institute in Detmold, a combined sewing <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and protectory conducted by the <a href="../cathen/03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a> (from <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>). Concerning orders and congregations there is no provision made by the State. However, article 13 of the edict of 1854 provides that all cases of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerning the application of the said edict or any conflicts over the bounds of episcopal authority, shall be determined by the definitions of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Constitution of 31 January, 1850. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are private, but the State furnishes half of the salaries and pensions of the teachers. The people of the eight <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> districts are exempt from payment of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> assessments (Law of 30 Deccember, 1904). Two free <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (Falkenhagen and Grevenhagen) enjoy the privileges of public primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. That of Cappel is a public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, attended by members of different Churches, yet <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in character as long as the majority of the inhabitants of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> district are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.
