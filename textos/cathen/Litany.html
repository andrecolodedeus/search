<h1>Litany</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>litania</em>, <em>letania</em>, from Greek <em>lite</em>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> or supplication)

<p>A litany is a well-known and much appreciated form of responsive petition, used in public <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> services, and in <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">private devotions</a>, for common necessities of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or in calamities &mdash; to implore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> aid or to appease His just wrath. This form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> finds its model in Psalm cxxxv: "Praise the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. Praise ye the God of gods . . . the Lord of lords . . . Who alone doth great wonders . . . Who made the heavens", etc., with the concluding words in each verse, "for his mercy endureth for ever." Similar is the canticle of praise by the youths in the fiery furnace (<a href="../bible/dan003.htm#vrs57">Daniel 3:57-87</a>), with the response, "praise and exalt him above all for ever." In the Mass of the Oriental Church we find several litanies in use even at the present day. Towards the end of the Mass of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> asks all to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; he formulates the petitions, and all answer "Kyrie Eleison". When the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> have departed, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> asks the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>: for the peace and welfare of the world, for the Holy, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and Apostolic Church, for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, for the sick, for those who have gone astray, etc., to each of which petitions the faithful answer <a href="../cathen/08714a.htm">"Kyrie Eleison"</a>, or "Grant us, 0 Lord", or "We beseech Thee." The litany is concluded by the words, "Save us, restore us again, 0 Lord, by Thy mercy." The last petitions in our <a href="../cathen/09291a.htm">Litany of the Saints</a>, with the responses "Deliver us, 0 Lord" and "We beseech Thee hear us", show a great resemblance to the Mass Litany of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>. In the Ambrosian or <a href="../cathen/01394a.htm">Milanese Rite</a> two litanies are recited on the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> instead of the "Gloria in excelsis". In the Stowe <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> a litany is inserted between the Epistle and Gospel (Duchesne, "Christian Worship", London, 1904, 199). The Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> has retained the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for all classes of people in the Mass of the Presanctified on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, a full litany on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>, and the triple repetition of "Kyrie Eleison", "Christe Eleison", "Kyrie Eleison", in every Mass. The frequent repetition of the "Kyrie" was probably the original form of the Litany, and was in use in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at a very early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. The Council of <a href="../cathen/16078b.htm">Vaison</a> in 529 passed the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>: "Let that beautiful custom of all the provinces of the East and of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> be kept up, viz., that of singing with great effect and compunction the <a href="../cathen/08714a.htm">"Kyrie Eleison"</a> at Mass, <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, because so sweet and pleasing a chant, even though continued day and night without interruption, could never produce disgust or weariness". The number of repetitions depended upon the celebrant. This litany is prescribed in the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> at the "Preces Feriales" and in the Monastic <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> for every "Hora" (<a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>, ix, 17). The continuous repetition of the "Kyrie" is used today at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a church, while the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> to be placed in the altar are carried in <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> around the church. Because the "Kyrie" and other petitions were said once or oftener, litanies were called <em>plan&oelig;, tern&oelig;, quin&oelig;, septen&oelig;</em>.

<p>When peace was granted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> after three centuries of bloody <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, public devotions became common and processions were frequently held, with preference for days which the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> had held sacred. These processions were called litanies, and in them pictures and other religious emblems were carried. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and people would go in procession each day, especially in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, to a different church, to celebrate the Sacred Mysteries. Thus originated the Roman "Stations", and what was called the "Litania Major", or "Romana". It was held on 25 April, on which day the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> had celebrated the festival of <em>Robigalia</em>, the principal feature of which was a procession. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> litany which replaced it set out from the church of S. Lorenzo in Lucina, held a station at S. Valentino Outside the Walls, and then at the Milvian Bridge. From thence, instead of proceeding on the Claudian Way, as the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> had done, it turned to the left towards the Vatican, stopped at a cross, of which the site is not given, and again in the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a> or atrium of St. Peter's, and finally in the basilica itself, where the station was held (Duchesne, 288). In 590, when a pestilence caused by an overflow of the Tiber was ravaging <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> commanded a litany which is called "Septiformis"; on the preceding day he exhorted the people to fervent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and arranged the order to be observed in the procession, viz, that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from S. Giovanni Battista, the men from S. Marcello, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from SS. Giovanni e Paolo, the unmarried <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> from SS. Cosma e Damiano, the married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> from San Stefano, the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> from S. Vitale, the poor and the children from S. C&aelig;cilia, were all to meet at S. Maria Maggiore. The "Litania Minor", or "Gallicana", on the Rogation Days before <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension</a>, was introduced (477) by <a href="../cathen/09580a.htm">St. Mamertus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vienne, on account of the earthquakes and other calamities then prevalent. It was prescribed for the whole of <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Gaul, in 511, by the Council of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> (can. xxvii). For <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> it was ordered by <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a>, in 799. In the Ambrosian Rite this litany was celebrated on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday after <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension</a>. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> we find a similar litany from Thursday to Saturday after <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Whitsuntide</a>, another from the first to third of November, ordered by the Council of Gerunda in 517, and still another for December, commanded by the synod of Toledo in 638. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the Litany of Rogation Days (Gang-Days) was known in the earliest periods. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> it was ordered by a Synod of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in 813. Owing to the fact that the Mass Litany became popular through its use in processions, numberless varieties were soon made, especially in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Litanies appeared in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a>, of <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">God the Son</a>, of <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">God the Holy Ghost</a>, of the Precious Blood, of the Blessed Virgin, of the Immaculate Conception, of each of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in different countries, for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, etc. In 1601 <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> wrote that about eighty forms were in circulation. To prevent abuse, Pope <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> of 6 Sept., 1601, forbade the publication of any litany, except that of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> as found in the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> and that of Loreto. Today the litanies approved for public recitation are: of All Saints, of Loreto, of the Holy Name, of the Sacred Heart, and of St. Joseph.
