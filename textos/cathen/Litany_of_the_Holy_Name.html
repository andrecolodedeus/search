<h1>Litany of the Holy Name</h1>  

<p>An old and popular form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Name of Jesus</a>. The author is not known. Probably <a href="../cathen/02570c.htm">Binterim</a> (Denkw&uuml;rdigkeiten, IV, I, 597) is correct in ascribing it to the celebrated preachers of the Holy Name, Saints <a href="../cathen/02505b.htm">Bernardine of Siena</a> and John Capistran, at the beginning of the fifteenth century. At the request of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Pope Sixtus V</a> (1585-90) granted an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of 300 days for its recitation (Samson, "Die Allerheiligen Litanei", <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, 1894, 14). Though this was an implied recognition of the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a>, requests made in 1640, 1642, and 1662, for formal approval were rejected. In 1862 <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> approved one of the formularies in use, and attached an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of 300 days for the faithful of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> whose <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had made special application. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (16 Jan., 1886) extended the privilege to the entire world (Beringer, "Die Abl&auml;sse", <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, 1900, 142).

<p>This <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> is arranged on the plan of the Litany of Loreto, and begins with the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>. The first part enumerates a list of praises referring to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and as man. Remembering the blessing bestowed on Peter's confession (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs16">Matthew 16:16</a>), we call <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">"Son of the Living God"</a>, "Splendour of the Father", and "Brightness of Eternal Light" (the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into this world &#151; <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs9">John 1:9</a>). He is the "King of Glory" (Ps. xxiii, 10), the "Sun of Justice, rising for them that fear the name of the Lord" (<a href="../bible/mal004.htm#vrs2">Malachi 4:2</a>). But, lest this splendour and glory make us fear, we turn to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in His humanity, and appeal to him as "Son of the Virgin Mary", and, as such, "amiable" and "admirable"; and, though annihilating Himself in taking the form of a servant (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs7">Philippians 2:7</a>), He is still the "mighty God", "Father of the world to come", "Angel of the great counsel" (<a href="../bible/isa009.htm#vrs6">Isaiah 9:6</a>). Again, though "most powerful", he has become for us "most patient" (led as a sheep to the slaughter &#151; <a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs32">Acts 8:32</a>), "most obedient" (even to the death of the cross &#151; Phil., ii, 8), "meek and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> of heart" (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs29">Matthew 11:29</a>). He is the "Lover of chastity" and "Lover of us", blessing the clean of heart (<a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs8">Matthew 5:8</a>), and proving His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for us by giving His life to procure that peace which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> announced (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs14">Luke 2:14</a>) and life everlasting, whence He is "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of peace" and "Author of life". During His sojourn on earth He was, and is today, "Model of virtues" and "zealous for souls", "our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" and "our refuge"; He is "Father of the poor" and "Treasure of the faithful", the "Good Shepherd" Who lays down His life for His sheep (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#vrs11">John 10:11</a>); He is the "True Light", "Eternal Wisdom", "Infinite Goodness", "our Way and our Life" (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs6">John 14:6</a>); He is the "Joy of Angels" and "King of Patriarchs". Through Him all have obtained the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and strength to accomplish <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> designs, for He is "Master of Apostles", "Teacher of Evangelists", "Strength of Martyrs", "Light of Confessors", "Purity of Virgins", and "Crown of all Saints". After again calling for mercy and the granting of our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, we, in the second part of the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a>, beg <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to deliver us from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that would keep us from the attainment of our last end, from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the wrath of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the snares of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and the spirit of uncleanness, from eternal death and the neglect of His inspirations. We adjure Him by the mystery of His holy Incarnation, His nativity and infancy, His most Divine life and labours, His <a href="../cathen/01224a.htm">agony</a> and Passion, His Cross and dereliction, His languor, His Death and burial, His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> and <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>, His joys and Glory. (Where sanctioned by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the invocation "Through Thine institution of the most holy Eucharist" may be added after "Through Thine <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>" &#151; S.R.C., 8 Feb., 1905). The <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> closes with the triple invocation of the Lamb of God, the petition, "Jesus hear us", "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> graciously hear us", and two <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.
