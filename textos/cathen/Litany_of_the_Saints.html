<h1>Litany of the Saints</h1>  

<p>The model of all other <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a>, of great antiquity.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>It was used in the "Litania Septiformis" of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, and in the procession of <a href="../cathen/09580a.htm">St. Mamertus</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a> with the invocation of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were employed in the days of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> (d. 379) and of <a href="../cathen/07015a.htm">St. Gregory Thaumaturgus</a> (d. about 270) (Basil, Ep. lxiii; <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, VI, viii, <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, VIII, vii). It is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> when or by whom the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> was composed, but the order in which the Apostles are given, corresponding with that of the Canon of the Mass, proves its antiquity (Walafr. Strabo, "De Reb. Eccl.", xxiii).
<h2>Structure and content</h2>
<h3>First part</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> begins with the call for mercy upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">God the Son</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">God the Holy Ghost</a>, in the "Kyrie eleison", "Christe eleison", <a href="../cathen/08714a.htm">Kyrie eleison</a>". Then, considering Christ as our Saviour and Mediator, we ask Him to hear us. In order to render more secure the hearing of our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, we again ask each of the Persons of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> for mercy, and, adding those titles which give us a claim to Their consideration, we call upon the First Person: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, to whom we owe existence and life; the Second: Redeemer of the world, to Whom we owe our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; the Third: Holy Ghost, to whom we owe our sanctification; and then on the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>To render <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> propitious, we, aware of our own unworthiness, ask the intercession of those who have become His special friends, through a holy life, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in lasting communion with Him. Foremost among these stands <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, the chosen daughter of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the undefiled mother of the Son, the stainless bride of the Holy Ghost &#151; we call upon her with the triple invocation: <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Holy Mary</a>, Mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Virgin of virgins. We then invoke the blessed spirits who remained firm in their allegiance to the Almighty during the rebellion of Lucifer and his adherents: Michael, prince of the heavenly host; Gabriel, "fortitude of God", the trusted companion of Tobias; and the other <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, archangels, and orders of blessed "ministering spirits, sent to minister for them, who shall receive the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>" (<a href="../bible/heb001.htm#vrs14">Hebrews 1:14</a>). Next in our confidence is he of whom Christ says "There hath nor risen among them that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> a greater than <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs11">Matthew 11:11</a>), the precursor of the Lord, the last of the Prophets of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a> and the first of the New.

<p>Next in order come St. Joseph, the foster-father of the Incarnate Word; and all the Patriarchs and Prophets who saved their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the hope of Him Who was the expected of the nations. Then follow the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: Peter, prince of the Apostles, vice-regent of Christ; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; Andrew, who first heeded the call of the Master; James the Greater and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John the Evangelist</a>, the beloved disciple, who, with St. Peter, were most favoured by Christ; Thomas, called Didymus, who received from Christ signal <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>; James the Less, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew, once called Levi, the toll-gatherer, who wrote the First Gospel; Simon the Zealot; Jude Thaddeus; Matthias, who was chosen to fill the place of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot</a>; Barnabas, called to the Apostolate by the Holy Ghost (<a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs2">Acts 13:2</a>); Luke, the physician, writer of the Third Gospel and the Acts; Mark, the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a>, disciple of St. Peter; all the Apostles and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>; the holy disciples of the Lord; the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Holy Innocents</a>, the infant martyr-flowers, "Who, slain at the command of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, confessed the name of the Lord not by speaking but by dying" (Rom. Brev.).

<p>The glorious <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are then invoked: <a href="../cathen/14286b.htm">Stephen the Deacon</a>, protomartyr, stoned at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> whilst <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for his executioners (<a href="../bible/act007.htm#vrs58">Acts 7:58</a>); Laurence, the Roman <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>; Vincent, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of Saragossa in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; Fabian, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and Sebastian, the soldier; John and Paul, brothers at the Court of <a href="../cathen/04294a.htm">Constantia</a>, daughter of Constantine; Cosmas and Damian, renowned physicians of &AElig;gea in Cilicia; <a href="../cathen/06537a.htm">Gervasius and Protasius</a>, brothers at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>; after which follows a collective impetration of all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> now asks the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> of St. Sylvester, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> who saw the triumph of the Crucified over <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>; of the <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctors of the Church</a>; Sts. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a>, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose of Milan</a>; Augustine of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, in Africa; and Jerome, representing <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> and the Holy Land; of the renowned Bishops <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">Martin of Tours</a>; <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">Nicholas of Myra</a>; of all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and confessors; of all the holy teachers; of the founders of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders: Anthony, father of the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>; Benedict, patriarch of the Western <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; Bernard; <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">Dominic</a>; Francis; of all <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and levites; of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a>. We then invoke <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a>, the model of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> penance and of a contemplative life, of whom Christ said: "Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memory of her" (<a href="../bible/mat026.htm#vrs13">Matthew 26:13</a>); the virgins and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>: <a href="../cathen/01203c.htm">Agatha</a>, Lucy, Agnes, <a href="../cathen/03471b.htm">Cecilia</a>, Catherine, and Anastasia the Younger; and in conclusion of the holy virgins and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>; all the holy men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.
<h3>Second part</h3>

<p>The second part of the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> begins with another cry of "Be merciful to us, spare us O Lord; Be merciful to us, graciously hear us O Lord". We then enumerate the ills from which we hope to be delivered: From all evils; from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; the wrath of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; sudden and unprovided death; the snares of the devil; <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, and all ill will; the spirit of fornication; lightning and tempest; the scourge of earthquake; plague, famine, and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; from everlasting death. To make our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> more effective, we present to Christ all that He did for us through the mystery of the Incarnation, through His coming, nativity, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, cross and passion, death and burial, <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">holy resurrection</a>, admirable ascension, the coming of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the Comforter, and we conclude by the petition, "In the day of judgment, O Lord, deliver us."
<h3>Third part</h3>

<p>In the third part we humbly acknowledge our unworthiness: "We, sinners, beseech Thee, hear us", and add the list of favours that we wish to obtain: that the Lord spare us; pardon us; and bring us to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> penance; that He govern and preserve His holy Church; preserve our Apostolic <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, and all orders of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> religion; <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; give peace and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> concord to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> kings and princes; peace and unity to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> nations; strengthen and preserve us in His holy service; raise our minds to heavenly desires; reward with eternal good all our benefactors; deliver us, our brethren, kinsfolk, and benefactors, from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a>; give and preserve the fruits of the earth; and grant eternal rest to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> departed. We ask all this in calling upon the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, thrice invoking the Lamb of God who takes away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the world. We repeat the "Kyrie", as in the beginning, and add the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> taught by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Father</a>. Then follow <a href="../bible/psa069.htm">Psalm 69</a>, "O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, come to my assistance", etc., and a number of verses, responses, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, renewing the former petitions. We conclude with an earnest request to be heard, and an appeal for the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> departed.
<h2>Forms</h2>

<p>Three forms of the Litany of the Saints are at present in <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> use.
<h3>First form</h3>

<p>The form given above is prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a> at the laying of the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> of a new church, at the blessing or reconciliation of the same or of a cemetery, in the rite of blessing the people and fields in virtue of a special <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">papal indult</a>, for the major and minor Rogation Days, in the procession and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to obtain rain or fine weather, to avert storms and tempests, in time of famine or <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, to escape mortality or in time of pestilence, in any tribulation, during the translation of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, in <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">solemn exorcisms</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">possessed</a>, and at the <a href="../cathen/06151a.htm">Forty Hours' Devotion</a>. The Roman Pontifical, besides the occasions given in the Ritual, orders its recitation in the conferring of major orders, in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, benediction of an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> or <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of virgins, <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of a king or queen, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a church, expulsion and readmission of public penitents on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>, and in the "Ordo ad Synodum".
<h3>Second form</h3>

<p>Another form is given in the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> for <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> and the Vigil of Pentecost. It is an abbreviation of the other. Each verse and response must be duplicated in this <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> and in that chanted on Rogation Days (S.R.C., 3993, ad 4).
<h3>Third form</h3>

<p>A third form is in the "Commendatio" of the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>, in which the invocations and supplications are specially chosen to benefit the departing <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> about to appear before its Maker (Holzhey, "Thekla-Akten", 1905, 93). This and the preceding form may not be used on other occasions (S.R.C., 2709, ad 1).

<p>Formerly it was customary to invoke only classes of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, then individual names were added, and in many places local <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were added (Rock, "The Church of Our Fathers", London, 1903, 182; "Manuale Lincopense", <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, 1904, 71). To obtain uniformity, changes and additions to the approved were forbidden (S.R.C., 2093, 3236, 3313).
