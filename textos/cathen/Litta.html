<h1>Litta</h1>  

<p>A noble <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> which gave two distinguished <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Alfonso Litta</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, born in 1608; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 22 Aug., 1679. After filling other important positions, he was appointed governor of the Marches by <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a>, was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> in 1652, and received the purple in 1640. He died shortly after the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> which elected <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>. He was a learned and charitable man and defended with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a> against the officers of the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. His works are enumerated by Argelati in the "Bibliotheca Scriptorum Mediolanensium" (Milan, 1745); his life was written by M. Bardocchi (Bologna, 1691).
<h2 id="section2">Lorenzo Litta</h2>

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 25 Feb, 1756; died at Monte Flavio, 1 May, 1820. A distinguished <em>litt&eacute;rateur,</em> he played a prominent part in contemporary <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>. As a youth he was sent by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to the Clementine College in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he made rapid progress in letters and law. Not long after the completion of his studies he was made prothonotary Apostolic by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>. In 1793 he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14562b.htm">Thebes</a>, and sent as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, where he arrived in March, 1794, shortly before the outbreak of the revolution. Notwithstanding the difficulty of his own position, he used his influence with <a href="../cathen/08694a.htm">Kosciuszko</a> on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a>, and saved the life of Monsignor Skarzewski, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03645d.htm">Chelm</a>, already condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>, though he was not so successful with regard to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Wilna and Livonia. In the negotiations for the third partition of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, he used his utmost endeavours to have the three States guarantee the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> organization and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> &mdash; guarantees which were disgracefully violated by Catherine II. On the latter's death Litta was sent on an extraordinary mission to <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> for the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of <a href="../cathen/11577a.htm">Paul I</a>, whence he was transferred as ambassador of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> to St. Petersburg, to settle, according to <a href="../cathen/11577a.htm">Paul's</a> wish, the affairs of the Latin and the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> church. He secured the erection, or rather restoration, of six <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> and three of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> (Polotsk, Lutsk, and Brest). The restoration of the See of Kiev was prevented by the Holy Synod. <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">Church property</a> was only partly restored, though the Government was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to establish suitable allowances for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Litta also induced the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> (Posnania), and Lemberg (Galicia) to renounce their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> in Russian territory, these being transferred to the new <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of <a href="../cathen/10428a.htm">Mohileff</a>. Through his efforts also the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian Order</a> was restored. In April, 1789, he had to leave <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>.

<p>On the death of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> he went to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to assist at the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>. When he returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he was given an office in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> treasury which enabled him to eradicate many abuses and introduce a better administration. In 1801 he was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and was made Prefect of the Congregation of the Index and, later, of Studies. In 1809 he was expelled from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> and sent to Saint-Quentin on the Seine. During this exile he translated the Iliad, and wrote a series of letters containing a brilliant refutation of the four Gallican Articles of 1682, then the subject of much discussion. Some of these letters were addressed to <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> himself, and were later published anonymously. Returning to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, Litta was made Prefect of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, which, under his administration, soon recovered its former status. In 1814 he became <a href="../cathen/14324a.htm">suburbicarian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sabina, and in 1818 Cardinal Vicar of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He is buried at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in SS. Giovanni e Paolo.
