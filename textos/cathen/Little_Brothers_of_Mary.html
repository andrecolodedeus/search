<h1>Little Brothers of Mary</h1>  

<p>Generally known as Marist School Brothers. This religious teaching institute is modern in its origin, having been founded in 1817, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, by the Venerable Benedict Marcellin Champagnat. This <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, especially attracted to the care of the children of the people, worked <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> for their primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Besides the rules and constitutions of this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, he wrote valuable manuals and methods for the pedagogic training of his disciples. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> definitively recognized and approved this <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> institute by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 9 January, 1863. Its development in the last sixty years has been wonderful. When the founder died (1840), his <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> consisted of 310 members and had the charge of forty-eight <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, all in the central part of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Today (1910) it numbers 6000 members pursuing their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> labours in all parts of the world, as shown by the following statistics of these <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishments</a>: <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 81 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, 41; British Isle, 25; <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 16; Turkey in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, 9; <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, 3; <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, 1 each. When the "secularization law" was enacted in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1903), the Marist Brothers had charge of 750 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in that country. Cape Colony (<a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>), 9 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; Seychelles Islands, 2; <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, 1; Australia, 20; New Zealand, 9; New Caledonia, 6; Fiji Islands, 4; Samoa Islands, 3; New Hebrides, 1; <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, 27; <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, 13; Turkey in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, 5; Ceylon, 2; Arabia, 1; <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, 36; <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, 29; Mexico, 25; Columbia, 21; <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, 12; <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentina</a>, 8; Cuba, 2; <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chili</a>, 3; <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, 3.

<p>The Marist Brothers were sent to Oceanica as coadjutors to the missionaries and the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marist Fathers</a> in 1836. In 1852 they established their English province, which rapidly spread its branches throughout the United Kingdom and the British Colonies in South Africa and Australasia. The introduction of the Marist Brothers in North America (1885) was a very auspicious event for the dissemination of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principles among the pupils entrusted to their charge in the field of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The institute of the Marist Brothers is legally incorporated under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">State of New York</a>. The Marist Brothers do not limit their efforts to the ordinary work of the classroom, but labour in any form for the welfare of youth. Besides primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, they conduct boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and academies, industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, homes for working boys, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, etc. The Marist Brothers are not <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. They are a congregation solely devoted to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> work. In selecting postulates for the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, they never accept anyone who has aspirations for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Their aim is to secure recruits who are likely to develop special aptitudes for the mission of teaching. For the training and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of competent subjects, the institute possesses three kinds of establishments: the junior <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, and the scholasticate or normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The Marist <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, for the American province, is at Poughkeepsie, New York, and the scholasticate in New York City.
