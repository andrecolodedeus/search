<h1>Little Office of Our Lady</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, in imitation of, and in addition to, the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>.

<p>It is first heard of in the middle of the eighth century at <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>. According to <a href="../cathen/02645b.htm">Cardinal Bona</a>, who quotes from a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of <a href="../cathen/11783c.htm">Peter the Deacon</a> (twelfth century), there was, in addition to the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, another "which it is customary to perform in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Holy Mother of God</a>, which Zachary the Pope [d. 752] commanded under strict precept to the Cassinese Monastery." This would seem to indicate that some form of the Office of Our Lady was already extant and, indeed, we hear of an Office in her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> composed by <a href="../cathen/07649b.htm">St. Ildephonsus</a>, who lived about the end of the seventh century. The <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, too, possesses an Office of the B.V.M., attributed to <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a> (c. 730). But though various Offices in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> were in existence earlier, it is probable that the Little Office, as a part of the liturgy, did not come into general use before the tenth century; and it is not unlikely that its diffusion is largely due to the marked <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Blessed Virgin</a> which is characteristic of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> under the guidance of <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">St. Dunstan</a> and <a href="../cathen/05555b.htm">St. Ethelwold</a>. Certainly during the tenth century, an Office of the Blessed Virgin is mentioned at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, at <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, and at Eisiedeln; while already in the following century there were at least two versions of her "Hours" extant in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In the eleventh century we learn from <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a> that it was already commonly recited amongst the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and it was through his influence that the practice of reciting it in choir, in addition to the Great Office, was introduced into several <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. At Cluny the Office of the B.V.M. was not introduced till the end of the eleventh century, and then only as a devotion for the sick <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. In the twelfth century came the foundation of the Orders of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> and Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;, of which the latter only retained the Little Office in addition to the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Austin Canons</a> also retained it, and, perhaps through their influence, in the course of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, it developed from a private devotion into part of the daily <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> as well. By the fourteenth century the recital of the Little Office had come to be an almost universal practice and was regarded as <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> on all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. This <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> remained until <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a> removed it by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Quod a nobis" of 1568. At the present time, however, it is recited on certain days by several of the older orders, and it serves, instead of the Greater Office, as the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> and lay sisters in some of the contemplative orders, and of the members of most of the congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> engaged in active work.

<p>Down to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> it formed a large part of the "Primer or Lay-folk's Prayer-book", and was customarily recited by the devout <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, by whom the practice was continued for long afterwards among the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Today it is recited daily by <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, Augustinian, and by large numbers of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Tertiaries, as well as by many <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> who desire to take part in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is worth noting that the form of the Little Office of Our Lady has varied considerably at different periods and in different places. The earlier versions varied very considerably, chiefly as regards the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> used: in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> the main differences seem to have been between the Sarum and York Uses. Since the time of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a>, that most commonly recited has been the version of the reformed <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> of that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In this version, which suffers somewhat from the classicism of the sixteenth century, are to be found the seven "Hours", as in the Greater Office. At <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>, after the versicles follow the invitatory "Ave Maria, gratia plena, Dominus tecum" with the "Venite" then the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> "Quem terra, pontus, sidera"; then three groups of psalms, each with their <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, of which one group is said on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, Mondays, and Thursdays, the second on Tuesdays and Fridays, the third on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Next follow three lessons with responsories and (except in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> and <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>) the "Te Deum". At <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>, there are the eight psalms of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> for <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, sung to five <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>. Then the Little Chapter, and the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> "O Gloriosa Virginum". Next a versicle and the canticle "Benedictus" with its antiphon. Lastly, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and commemoration of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. In each of the four Little Hours the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> "Memento rerum conditor" immediately follows the versicles; then three psalms are recited, under one of the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> of <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>; then are said the Little Chapter, versicles, and a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. At <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, after the versicles and five psalms with their <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, follow the Little Chapter, the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> "Ave Maris stella", a short versicle, and the canticle "Magnificat" with its antiphon; then the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> as at <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>. <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a> begins with special versicles, then follow three psalms without <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, then the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> "Memento rerum conditor", a Little Chapter, a versicle, the canticle "Nunc Dimittis", versicles, a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and the Benediction. After the hours are recited the "Pater Noster" and the proper antiphon of Our Lady for the season. This last, the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> of the psalms and canticles and the Little Chapters are the only parts of the office that vary with the seasons. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> granted (17 Nov., 1887), to those who recite the whole Office of Our Lady, an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> daily of seven years and seven quarantines, and a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> once a month; to those who recite <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> and <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a> only, a daily <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of three hundred days; and (8 Dec., 1897) to those who recite <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> and <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a> only, and for each Hour, an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of fifty days.
