<h1>Liturgical Books</h1>  

<p>Under this name we understand all the books, published by the authority of any church, that contain the text and directions for her official (liturgical) services. It is now the book that forms the standard by which one has to judge whether a certain service or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> or <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> is official and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> or not. Those things are <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a>, and those only, that are contained in one of the liturgical books. It is also obvious that any church or religion or <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> is responsible for the things contained in its liturgical books in quite another sense than for the contents of some private book of devotion, which she at most only allows and tolerates. The only just way of judging of the services, the tone, and the <em>ethos</em> of a religious body, is to consult its liturgical books. <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">Sects</a> that have no such official books are from that very fact exposed to all manner of vagaries in their devotion, just as the absence of an official creed leads to all manner of vagueness in their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. In this article the liturgical books of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> are described first, then a short account is given of those of the other rites.
<h2 id="section1">The first traces of liturgical books</h2>

<p>Our present convenient compendiums &#151; the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, and so on &#151; were formed only at the end of a long evolution. In the first period (lasting perhaps till about the fourth century) there were no books except the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, from which lessons were read and psalms were sung. Nothing was written, because nothing was fixed (see <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">LITURGY</a>). Even after certain forms had become so stereotyped as to make already what we should call a more or less fixed liturgy, it does not seem that there was at first any <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that they should be written down. Habit and memory made the celebrant repeat more or less the same forms each Sunday; the people answered his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> with the accustomed acclamations and responses &#151; all without books.

<p>It has been much discussed at what period we have evidence of written <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. <a href="../cathen/12769a.htm">Renaudot</a> ("Liturgiarum Orientalium Collectio", 2nd ed., Frankfurt, 1847, I, pp. ix and xi) thought that no books were written even by the fourth century. He argues this from a passage in <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> (died 379), who distinguishes between the written teaching of the Apostles (in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>) and the unwritten tradition, and quotes <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> functions as belonging to this: "Who", he asks, "of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> has written down for us the words of the Sacred Invocation in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the bread and <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>?" (<a href="../fathers/3203.htm"><em>On the Holy Spirit</em> 27</a>). Another argument is that no mention is made of liturgical books in the acts of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (who are required to give up their holy books, that is, always, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>), or in the quarrels about the books with the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> in the fourth century. Daniel ("Codex liturgicus", IV, Leipzig, 1853, pp. 25-32) argues against this opinion at length, and defends the view that <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> were written down at the beginning of the fourth century. Probst ("Die &auml;ltesten r&ouml;mischen Sakramentarien und Ordines", M&uuml;nster, 1892, pp. 1-19) tries to establish that there were liturgical books back to the time of the <a href="../cathen/01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a>. The argument from St. Basil may be dismissed at once. He is only explaining the well-known distinction between the two sources of revelation, Scripture and tradition. Tradition is distinct from Scripture; it may include other written books, but not the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. By "saints" he means only the writers of Scripture, and therefore his statement is that the Eucharistic Invocation is not in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. As for the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, there is, on the contrary, evidence that both they and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had liturgical books at that time. Optatus of Mileve, writing about the year 370 against them, says: "You have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> cleaned the palls" (linen cloths used in Mass), "tell me what you have done with the books?" ("De schism. Donat.", V, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> edition, 1893, p. 153.) What were these books? Both palls and books had been taken from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, both were used in the liturgy (ibid.). The books were not the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> thought them polluted (ibid.). So there were other liturgical books besides the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. Augustine too reproaches the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> with being in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> with the very churches whose names they read in the "holy books" (epp. lii and liii). So also a synod at <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a> in Africa (in 393) forbids anyone to write down the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of other Churches and use them, until he has shown his copy to the more learned brethren (can. xxv; <a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>-<a href="../cathen/09109a.htm">Leclercq</a>, "Histoire des Conciles", II, Paris, 1908, p. 88; cf. Probst, op. cit., 13-14).

<p>That some <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were occasionally written down from the first age is evident. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayers</a> are quoted in the <a href="../cathen/01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a> ("Didache", ix, x; Clement, "First Epistle to the Corinthians", lix, 3-lxi. See <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">LITURGY</a>). This does not, however, prove the existence of liturgical books. Probst thinks that the exact quotations made by the Fathers as far back as the second century prove that the liturgy was already written down. Such quotations, he says, could only be made from written books (op. cit., 15-17). This argument does not seem very convincing. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that formul&aelig;, especially <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> formul&aelig;, can become very definite and well-known before they are put in a book. A more solid reason for the existence of a written liturgy at any rate by the fourth century is the comparison of the liturgy of the eighth book of the <a href="../cathen/01637a.htm">Apostolic Fathers</a> with the Byzantine Rite of St. Basil. Proclus (died 446) says that Basil (died 379) modified and shortened the liturgy because it was too long for the people. There is no reason to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> what he says (see <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">THE RITE OF CONSTANTINOPLE</a>). The liturgy shortened by Basil was that of Antioch, of which we have the oldest specimen in the Apostolic Constitutions. A comparison of this (especially the Thanksgiving-prayer) with that of St. Basil (Brightman, "Eastern Liturgies", pp. 14-18 and 321-3) shows in effect that Basil is much shorter. It does not seem likely that, after Basil's <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> shortening, anyone should have taken the trouble to write out the discarded long form. Therefore, the liturgy of the Apostolic Constitutions was written before St. Basil's reform, although it is incorporated into a work not finally compiled till the early fifth century (Funk, "Die apostolischen Konstitutionen", <a href="../cathen/13207b.htm">Rottenburg</a>, 1891, p. 366; Probst, op. cit., 12-13).



<p>Our conclusion then is that at any rate by the middle of the fourth century there were written <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, and therefore liturgical books of some kind, however incomplete. How long before that anything was written down we cannot say. We conceive portions of the rite written out as occasion required. Evidently one of the first things to be written was the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> containing the lists of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and churches for whom <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were to be said. These <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> were used liturgically &#151; the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> read them &#151; in all rites down to the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Augustine's argument against the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> refers to the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> (epp. lii and liii above). The <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> were two tablets folded like a book (<em>dis</em> and <em>ptyche</em>); on one side the names of the living, on the other those of the dead were written. They have now disappeared and the names are said from memory. But the Byzantine Rite still contains the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a>: "The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> remembers the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> of the departed"; "He remembers the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> of the living" (Brightman, op. cit., 388-9). No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the next thing to be written out was the collection of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> said by the celebrant (Sacramentaries and <a href="../cathen/05595b.htm">Euchologia</a>), then indications for the readers (Comites, Capitularia, Synaxaria) and the various books for the singers (Antiphonaries, books of Troparia), and finally the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrical</a> directions (Ordines, Typika).
<h2 id="section2">History of the Roman liturgical books</h2>

<p>So far the development went on in parallel lines in East and West. When we come to the actual books we must distinguish between the various rites, which have different groups and arrangements. In the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> the first complete books we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> are the Sacramentaries (<em>Sacramentaria</em>). A Sacramentary is not the same thing as a <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. It contains more on the one side, less on the other. It is the book for the celebrant. It contains all and only the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that he says. At the time that these books were written it was not yet the custom for the celebrant also to repeat at the altar whatever is sung by the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> or choir. Thus Sacramentaries contain none of those parts of the Mass, no Lessons, no <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introits</a>, Graduals, Offertories and so on, but only the Collects, Prefaces, Canon, all that is strictly the celebrant's part. On the other hand they provide for his use at other occasions besides Mass. As the celebrant is normally supposed to be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the Sacramentary supplies him with the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> he wants at ordinations, at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a church and altar and many <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcisms</a>, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrations</a> that are now inserted in the Pontifical and Ritual. That is the order of a complete Sacramentary. Many of those now extant are more or less fragmentary.

<p>The name <em>Sacramentarium</em> is equivalent to the other form also used (for instance, in the Gelasian book), <em>Liber Sacramentorum</em>. The form is the same as that of the word <em>Hymnarium</em>, for a book of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>. <a href="../cathen/06417a.htm">Gennadius of Marseilles</a> (fifth cent.) uses both. He says of <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">Paulinus of Nola</a>: "Fecit et sacramentarium et hymnarium" (De viris illustribus, xlviii). The word <em>sacramentum</em> or <em>sacramenta</em> in this case means the Mass. <em>Sacramenta celebrare</em> or <em>facere</em> is a common term for saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. So St. Augustine (died 430) remarks that we say "Sursum corda" "in sacramentis fidelium", that is at Mass (De Dono Persev., xiii, 33), and two schismatics of the fifth century complain to the Emperors Gratian and <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> that Pope Damasus (366-84) will not let them say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>; but they do so all the same, because "salutis nostr&aelig; sacramenta facienda sunt" (Faustinus and Marcellinus, "Lib. prec. ad Imp." in P.L., XIII, 98; cf. Probst, "Die &auml;ltesten r&ouml;m. Sakram.", 20-1). A number of Sacramentaries of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> are still extant, either complete or in part. Of these the most important are the three known by the names Leonine, Gelasian, and Gregorian. Their date, authorship, place, and original purpose have been much discussed. What follows is a compilation of the views of recognized scholars.

<p>The so-called "Sacramentarium Leonianum" is the oldest. Only one <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of it is known, written in the seventh century. This <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> was found in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, was published by <a href="../cathen/02541b.htm">Joseph Bianchini</a> in 1735 in the fourth volume of his edition of Anastasius Bibliothecarius, and was by him attributed arbitrarily to <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo I</a> (440-61). On the strength of this attribution the book was included by the <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Ballerini</a> in their edition of Leo (Venice, 1753-7), and still bears the name Leonine. It was reprinted by Muratori in his "Liturgia Romana vetus" (Venice, 1748). Now the best edition is that of C. L. Feltoe (Cambridge, 1896). The Leonine Sacramentary represents a pure Roman use with no Gallican elements. But it is not a book compiled for use at the altar. The hopeless confusion of its parts shows this. It is a fragment, containing no Canon nor Ordinary of the Mass, but a collection of Propers (Collects, Secrets, Prefaces, Postcommunions, and Orationes super populum), of various Masses with <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> forms, arranged according to the civil year. It begins in the middle of the sixth Mass for April, and ends with a blessing for the font "In ieiunio mensis decimi" (i.e. the winter Ember-days). In each month groups of Masses are given, often very large groups, for each feast and occasion. Thus, for instance, in June we find twenty-eight Masses for St. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, one after another, each headed: "Item alia" (Feltoe's ed., pp. 36-50); there are fourteen for <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>, twenty-three for the anniversary of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> (123-39), and so on. Evidently the writer has compiled as many alternative Masses for each occasion as he could find. In many cases he shows great carelessness. He inserts Masses in the wrong place. Many of his Masses <em>in natali episcoporum</em> have nothing at all to do with that anniversary, and are really Masses for <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> after Pentecost; in the middle of a Mass of <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">St. Cornelius</a> and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> he has put the preface of a Mass of St. Euphemia (p. 104), a Mass for the new civil year is inserted among those for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (XX <em>item alia</em>, p. 9); Masses for St. Stephen's day (26 Dec.) with evident allusions to <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> are put in August (pp. 86-9), obviously through a confusion with the feast of the finding of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> (3 Aug.). Many other examples of the same confusion are quoted by Buchwald ("Das sogen. Sacramentarium Leonianum", Vienna, 1908). That the collection is Roman is obvious. It is full of local allusions to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. For instance, one of the collects to be said by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on the anniversary of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> could only be used by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope of Rome</a>: "Lord God . . . who, although Thou dost not cease to enrich with many gifts Thy Church spread throughout the world, nevertheless dost look more favourably upon the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of Thy blessed Apostle Peter, as Thou hast desired that it should be most exalted, etc." (p. 127). The Preface for St. John and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> remembers that they are buried within "the boundaries of this city" (p. 34); the Masses of the Patrons of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, St. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, continually allude to the city (so the preface in the twenty-third Mass: "who, foreseeing that our city would labour under so many troubles, didst place in it the chief members of the power of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>", p. 47), and so on continually (cf. Probst, op. cit., 48-53, etc.).

<p>Mgr Duchesne (Origines du Culte Chr&eacute;tien, 129-37) thinks that the Leonine book is a private collection of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> copied without much intelligence from the official books at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> about the year 538. He arrives at this <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> especially through an allusion in the Secret of a Mass placed in June (but really an <a href="../cathen/11516a.htm">Easter</a> Mass), which refers to a recent deliverance from enemies (Feltoe, p. 73). This allusion he understands to refer to the raising of the siege of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Vitiges and his <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> at <a href="../cathen/11516a.htm">Easter-time</a>, 538 (see his other arguments, pp. 131-2). Muratori considered that the book was composed under <a href="../cathen/06030b.htm">Felix III</a> (483-92; "Liturgia rom. vetus", diss. xxvii). Probst answers Duchesne's arguments (Die &auml;ltesten r&ouml;m. Sakram., pp. 56-61); he attributes the allusion in the Secret to Alaric's invasion in 402, and thinks that the compilation was made between 366 and 461. The latest theory is that of Buchwald (Das sogen. Sacram. Leon., 62-7), who suggests that the book is a compilation of Roman Masses made in the sixth or seventh century for use in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, so that the composers of Roman books who were at that time introducing the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> into Gaul (see <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">LITURGY</a>) might have a source from which to draw their material. He suggests <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> (died 594) as possibly the compiler.

<p>The "Gelasian Sacramentary" exists in several <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. It is a Roman book more or less Gallicanized; the various <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> represent different stages of this Gallican influence. The oldest form extant is a book written in the seventh or early eighth century for use in the abbey of St. Denis at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. This is now in the Vatican <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> (Manuscript Regin&aelig; 316). It was first published by <a href="../cathen/06573a.htm">Tommasi</a> in his "Codices Sacramentorum nongentis annis vetustiores" (Rome, 1680), then by Muratori in "Liturgia romana vetus", I. Other versions of the same book are the Codices of St. Gall and of Rheinau, both of the eighth century, edited by Gerbert in his "Monumenta veteris liturgi&aelig; alemmanic&aelig;," I (St. Blaise, 1777). These three (collated with others) form the basis of the standard edition of H. A. Wilson (Oxford, 1894). The book does not in any old <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> bear the name of Gelasius; it is called simply "Liber Sacramentorum Roman&aelig; ecclesi&aelig;". It is much more complete than the Leonine Sacramentary. It consists of three books, each marked with a not very accurate title. Book I (The Book of Sacraments in the order of the year's cycle) contains Masses for feasts and <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> from <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Eve</a> to the octave of Pentecost (there are as yet no special Masses for the season after Pentecost), together with the ordinations, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for all the rites of the catechumenate, blessing of the font at <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Easter Eve</a>, of the oil, dedication of churches, and reception of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> (Wilson, ed., pp. 1-160). Book II (<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayers</a> for the Feasts of Saints) contains the Proper of Saints throughout the year, the Common of Saints, and the <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> Masses (ibid., 161-223). Book III (<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayers</a> and the Canon for <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>) contains a great number of Masses marked simply "For Sunday" (i.e. any Sunday), the Canon of the Mass, what we should call votive Masses (e.g. for travellers, in time of trouble, for kings, and so on), Masses for the Dead, some <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> (of <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, fruits, trees and so on), and various <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for special occasions (224-315). An old tradition (Walafrid Strabo, ninth century, "De rebus eccl.", XX; <a href="../cathen/08491a.htm">John the Deacon</a>, "Vita S. Gregorii", II, xvii, etc.) ascribes what is evidently this book to Pope Gelasius I [492-6. <a href="../cathen/06417a.htm">Gennadius</a> (De vir. illust., xcvi) says he composed a book of Sacraments]. Duchesne (op. cit., 121-5) thinks it represents the Roman service-books of the seventh or eighth century (between the years 628 and 731). It was, however, composed in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom. All the local Roman allusions (for instance, the Roman Stations) have been omitted; on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> read: "Let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for our most Christian Emperor [the compiler has added] <em>or king</em>" (p. 76), and again: "look down mercifully on the Roman, <em>or the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a></em>, Empire" (ibid.). There are also Gallican additions (Duchesne, 125-8). Dom Baumer ("Ueber das sogen. Sacram. Gelas." in "Histor. Jahrbuch der G&ouml;rresgesellschaft", 1893, pp. 241-301) and Mr. Bishop ("The earliest Roman Massbook" in "Dublin Review", 1894; pp. 245-78) maintain that it is much earlier than Duchesne thinks, and ascribe it to the sixth century, at which time the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> entered Gaul (see <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">LITURGY</a>). Buchwald (Das sogen. Sacr. Leon., ibid., p. 66) agrees with Duchesne in dating this Sacramentary at the seventh or eighth century, and thinks that its compiler used the Leonine collection.

<p>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> most about the third of these books, the so-called "Gregorian Sacramentary". <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, anxious to introduce the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> into his kingdom, wrote to <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Pope Adrian I</a> between the years 781 and 791 asking him to send him the service-book of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. The book sent by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is the nucleus of the Gregorian Sacramentary. It was then copied a great number of times, so that there are many versions of it, all containing additions made by the various scribes. These are described by Probst (Die &auml;testen Sakr., pp. 303-13). The first edition is that of Pamelius in his "Rituale SS. Patrum Latinorum", II (Cologne, 1571). The standard edition is Muratori, "Liturgia romana vetus", II. This is based on two <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, both written before 800, now in the Vatican Library (Cod. Ottobonianus and Cod. Vaticanus). <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> (P.L., LXXVIII, 25-602) reprints the edition of Nicholas M&eacute;nard (Paris, 1642). Probst maintains that this is rather to be considered a Gelasian book, reformed according to the Gregorian (Die &auml;ltes. Sakr., pp. 165-9). In any case the elements are here completely fused. The original book sent by Adrian to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> is easily distinguished from the additions. The first who began to supplement Adrian's book from other sources (Pamelius says it was a certain <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Abbot named Grimold) was a conscientious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and carefully noted where his additions begin. At the end of the original book he adds a note, a <em>prefatiuncula</em> beginning with the word Hucusque: "So far (Hucusque) the preceding book of Sacraments is certainly that edited by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory</a>." Then come (in Pamelius's edition) two supplements, one (according to Pamelius) by Abbot Grimold and the other by <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>. The supplements vary considerably in the <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a>. Eventually their matter became incorporated in the original book. But in the earlier versions we may take the first part, down to the <em>prefatiuncula</em>, as being the book sent by Adrian. How far it is that of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory I</a> is another question. This book then has three parts: <ul><li>(1) The Ordinary of the Mass; <li>(2) the Propers for the year beginning with <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Eve</a>. They follow the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> year; the feasts of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> (days of the month in the civil year) are incorporated in their approximate places in this. The Roman Stations are noted. There are still no Masses for the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> after Epiphany and Pentecost; <li>(3) the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for ordinations.</ul>

<p>There are no votive Masses or requiems. For these reasons Mgr Duchesne considers that the "Sacramentary" is the "pope's book", that is the book used by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself for the public <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> services (Origines du Culte Chr&eacute;tien, p. 117). Is its attribution to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory I</a> (590-604) correct? That <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> did much to reform the liturgy is certain. A constant tradition ascribes such a work to him, as to Gelasius. <a href="../cathen/08491a.htm">John the Deacon</a> (eighth century) in his life of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> expresses this tradition: "He collected the Sacramentary of Gelasius in one book" (we have seen that the two sets of Propers in the Gelasianum are fused together in the Gregorianum), "leaving out much" (this too is verified by comparing the books; numbers of Gelasian Prefaces and ritual elaborations are omitted in the Gregorian book), "changing little, adding something" (II, xvii). Pope Adrian himself, in sending the book to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, says that it is composed "by our holy predecessor, the divinely speaking <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory</a>" (letter in Jaff&eacute;, "Cod. Carol.", p. 274). That the essential foundation of this "Sacramentary" goes back to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a>, indeed to long before his time, is certain. Nor need we <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he made such changes as are claimed for him by his biographer, and that these changes stand in this book. But it is not his work untouched. It has additions made since his time, for instance his own feast (12 March, in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne's</a> edition, P.L., LXXVIII, 51) and other feasts not kept at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> before the seventh century (Duchesne, op. cit., 118). Evidently then the book sent by Pope Adrian has gone through the inevitable development; succeeding centuries since <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> have added to it. It represents the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> of the time when it was sent &#151; the eighth century. For this reason Duchesne prefers to call it the "Sacramentary" of Adrian (op. cit., p. 119). We have said that, when it arrived in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom, it began to receive supplements. It must be remembered of course that the writers who copied it had not in view the future needs of students. The books they made were intended for practical use at the altar. So they added at the end of Adrian's "Sacramentary" whatever other Masses and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were wanted by the churches for which they wrote. These supplements are taken partly from the Gelasian book, partly from Gallican sources. We have also noted that the additions were at first carefully distinguished from the original book, eventually incorporated in it. Dom B&auml;umer sees in these additions a compromise made in carrying out <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> orders that only the book he had received from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> should be used (see LITURGIES; and Baumer, "Ueber das sogen. Sacram. Gelasianum", 295-301). He also thinks that the first additions and the <em>prefatiuncula</em> were made by <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a> (died 804). Between the ninth and eleventh centuries the book so composed returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, took the place of the original pure <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, and so became the foundation of our present Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. Besides these three most important Sacramentaries there are other fragments, the "Missale Francorum," written in the seventh or eighth century, the "Ravenna Roll" of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> date (sixth to eleventh century?), etc. (see Duchesne, "Origines", pp. 128-9, 137-8).

<p>At the same time as the Sacramentaries, books for the readers and choir were being arranged. Gradually the "Comes" or "Liber Comicus" that indicated the texts of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> to be read developed into the "Evangelarium" and "Lectionarium" (see <a href="../cathen/06659a.htm">GOSPEL IN THE LITURGY</a> and <a href="../cathen/09193a.htm">LESSONS IN THE LITURGY</a>). The <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> of Fathers to be read were collected in "Homilaria", the <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts of the martyrs</a>, read on their feasts, in "Martyrologia". The book of psalms was written separately for singing, then arranged in order, as the psalms were sung through the week, in the "Psalterium" that now forms the first part of our <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>. The parts of the Mass sung by the choir (<a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a>, Gradual, <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>, Communion) were arranged in the "Liber Antiphonarius" (or Gradualis), the Antiphons and Responsories in the Office formed the "Liber Responsalis", or "Antiphonarius Officii", as distinct from the "Antiphonarius Miss&aelig;". Two early collections of this kind, ascribed to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory I</a>, are in P.L., LXXVIII, 641-724, and 725-850. The same tradition that attributes to him the Sacramentary attaches his name to these (e.g., <a href="../cathen/08491a.htm">John the Deacon</a>, "Vita S. Gregorii", II, vi). Throughout the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> such collections were copied with local modifications all over Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Hymns (in our sense) were introduced into the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> about the fifth or sixth century. Those of the Mass were written in the Gradual, those of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> at first in the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> or Antiphonary. But there were also separate collections of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, called "Hymnaria", and "Libri Sequentiales" (or troponarii), containing the sequences and additions (farcing) to the Kyrie and Gloria, etc. Other services, the Sacraments (Baptism, Confirmation, Penance, Marriage, Extreme Unction), the Visitation of the Sick, the Burial Service, all manner of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>, were written in a very loose collection of little books called by such names as "Liber Agendorum", "Agenda", "Manuale", "Benedictionale", "Pastorale", "Sacerdotale", "Rituale", the predecessors of our Ritual. As examples of such books we may quote the "Manuale Curatorum" for the Diocese of Roeskilde in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> (ed. by J. Freisen, Paderborn, 1898) and the "Liber Agendorum" of <a href="../cathen/13542a.htm">Schleswig</a> (ed. J. Freising, Paderborn, 1898). Their number and variety is enormous.

<p>Finally there remained the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a>, the directions not about what to say but what to do. This matter would be one of the latest to be written down. Long after the more or less complicated <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> had to be written and read, tradition would still be a sufficient guide for the actions. The books of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> (Sacramentaries, Antiphonaries, etc.) contained a few words of direction for the most important and salient things to be done &#151; elementary <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a>. For instance the Gregorian "Sacramentary" tells <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (as distinct from <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>) not to say the Gloria except on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Day</a>; the celebrant chants the preface <em>excelsa voce</em>, and so on (P.L., LXXVIII, 25). In time, however, the growing elaborateness of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> functions, the more complicated ceremonial of the Roman Court, made it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to draw up rules of what custom and etiquette demanded. These rules are contained in the "Ordines" &#151; precursors of our "C&aelig;rimoniale Episcoporum". <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> published sixteen of the Ordines in his "Mus&aelig;um Italicum", II (Paris, 1689). These are reproduced in P.L., LXXVIII, 937-1372. They are of different dates, from about the eighth to the fifteenth century. The first of them ("Ordo Romanus primus", edited apart by E. G. C. Atchley with excellent notes, London, 1905), which is the most important, was probably drawn up about the year 770 in the reign of <a href="../cathen/14289a.htm">Pope Stephen III</a> (768-72), but is founded on a similar "Ordo" of the time of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory I</a> (590-604). The "Ordines" contain no <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, except that, where <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, the first words are given to indicate what is meant. They supplement the Sacramentary and choir-books with careful directions about the ritual. Since <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> other "Ordines" have been found and edited. A famous and important one, found in a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Amand at Puelle is published by Duchesne in the Appendix of his "Origines du Culte Chr&eacute;tien" (pp. 440-63). It was composed about the eighth or ninth century.

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> these books were rearranged for greater convenience, and developed eventually into the books we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. The custom of Low Mass changed the Sacramentary into a <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. At Low Mass the celebrant had to supplement personally what was normally chanted by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> or sung by the choir. This then reacted upon High Mass, so that here too the celebrant began to say himself in a low voice what was sung by some one else. For this purpose he needed texts that were not in the old Sacramentary. That book was therefore enlarged by the addition of Lessons (Epistle and Gospel, etc.) and the chants of the choir (<a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a>, Gradual, etc.). So it becomes a <em>Missale plenarium</em>, containing all the text of the Mass. Isolated cases of such Missals occur as early as the sixth century. By about the twelfth century they have completely replaced the old Sacramentaries. But Lectionaries and Graduals (with the music) are still written for the readers and choir. In the same way, but rather later, compilations are made of the various books used for saying the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>. Here too the same motive was at work. The Office was meant to be sung in choir. But there were isolated <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, small country churches without a choir, that could not afford the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of books required for saying it. For their convenience compendiums were made since the eleventh century. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> (1073-85) issued a compendium of this kind that became very popular.

<p>First we hear of <em>Libri nocturnales</em> or <em>matutinales</em>, containing all the lessons and responses for <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>. To these are added later the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> and psalms, then the collects and all that is wanted for the other <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">canonical hours</a> too. At the same time epitomes are made for people who recite the Office without the chant. In these the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> is often left out; the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are supposed to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it by heart. The <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, versicles, responsories, even the lessons are indicated only by their first words. The whole is really a kind of concise index to the Office, but sufficient for people who said it day after day and almost <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it by heart. Such little books are called by various names &#151; "Epitomata", "Portiforia", and then especially "Breviaria divini officii" (Abbreviations of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>). They were used mostly by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> on journeys. In the twelfth century the catalogue of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> includes "a little travelling breviary" (<em>breviarium parvum itinerarium</em>). In 1241 <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> says in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> order: "You have (the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>) in your Breviaries" (see Batiffol, "Histoire du Br&eacute;viaire", chap. iv, especially pp. 192-202). The parts of these Breviaries were filled up eventually so as to leave nothing to memory, but the convenient arrangement and the name have been kept. It is curious that the word <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, which originally meant only a handy epitome for use on journeys and such occasions, has come to be the usual name for the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> itself. A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> "says his breviary" that is, recites the <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">canonical hours</a>.

<p>The development of the other books took place in much the same way. The Missals now contained only the Mass and a few morning services intimately connected with it. Daily Mass was the custom for every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; there was no object in including all the rites used only by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in each <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. So these rites apart formed the Pontifical. The other non-Eucharistic elements of the old Sacramentary combined with the "Libri Agendarum" to form our Ritual. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (1545-63) considered the question of uniformity in the liturgical books and appointed a commission to examine the question. But the commission found the work of unifying so many and so varied books impossible at the time, and so left it to be done gradually by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> were reformed very soon (see next paragraph), the other books later. The latest work was the production of the "C&aelig;rimoniale Episcoporum". John Burchard, Master of Ceremonies to <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> (1471-84), combined the old "Ordines Romani" into an <em>Ordo servandus per sacerdotem in celebratione miss&oelig;</em> (Rome, 1502), and arranged the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> of the Pontifical. Other editions of the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> were made at intervals, till <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> (1592-1605) issued the "C&aelig;rimoniale Episcoporum" (in 1600). All the books have been constantly revised and re-edited with additions down to our own time.
<h2 id="section3">The present Roman liturgical books</h2>

<p>The official books of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> are seven &#151; the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, Pontifical, <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, Ritual, C&aelig;rimoniale Episcoporum, Memoriale Rituum, and Martyrology. These contain all and only the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> services of this rite. Several repeat matter also found in others. Other books, containing extracts from them, share their official character inasmuch as the texts conform to that of the original book. Such secondary liturgical books are the Lectionary and Gradual (with musical notes) taken from the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, the Day Hours (Hor&aelig; diurn&aelig;) of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, the Vesperal, Antiphonary and other choir-books (with notes), also extracted from the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, various Benedictionals and Ordines taken from the Ritual or Pontifical.
<h3 id="A">The Roman Missal</h3>

<p>The (<em>Missale Romanum</em>) as we now have it, was published by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pope Pius V</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Quo primum" of 14 July, 1570 (see LITURGIES and <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">ROMAN RITE</a>). A commission, opened by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> under <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> (1559-65), consisting of Cardinal Bernardine Scotti, <a href="../cathen/06631b.htm">Thomas Goldwell</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph</a> (one of the last two <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> line), Giulio Poggi, and others, had then finished its task of revising the book. <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> (1592-1605) formed a new commission (<a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, and others) to restore the text which printers had again corrupted, and especially to substitute the new <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> (1590) texts for those of the Itala in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>; he published his revision by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Cum Sanctissimum" on 7 July, 1604. <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> (1623-44) again appointed a commission to revise chiefly the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a>, and issued a new edition on 2 September, 1634 (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Si quid est"). <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (1878-1903) again made a revision in 1884. These names stand for the chief revisions; they are those named on the title-page of our <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> (Missale Romanum ex decreto SS. Concilii Tridentini restitutum S. Pii V Pont. Max. iussu editum, Clementis VIII, Urbani VIII et Leonis XIII auctoritate recognitum). But the continual addition of Masses for new feasts goes on. There are few <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> since <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> who have not authorized some additions, made by the Sacred Congregation of Rites, to the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> or its various supplements. The reigning <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> [1910], <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, has issued the chants of the Vatican edition in the Gradual. As far as these affect the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> they have again produced new editions of it. Moreover a commission now sitting is considering a further revision of the text. It is believed that when the commission for restoring the text of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> has completed its work, that text will be issued in the lessons of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, thus making again a new revision. But, in spite of all these modifications, our <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> is still that of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>. Indeed its text goes back to long before his time to the Gallicanized Gregorian "Sacramentary" of the ninth to eleventh century, and, in its essential characteristics, behind that to the Gelasian book of the sixth century, and so back into the mist that hangs over the formation of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> in the first centuries.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> begins with the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>, <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>. Then come the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in whose diocese it is printed and a few of the most important decisions of the Sacred Congregation of Rites. A long explanation of the Gregorian Calendar follows, containing much <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> information. This is headed: "De anno et eius partibus". The two Paschal tables follow (Julian and Gregorian), a table of movable feasts for a number of future years and the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">Calendar</a> of feasts. Then come three sets of <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a>, first "Rubric&aelig; generales Miss&aelig;", containing the more general rules in twenty paragraphs (these were made by Burchand, revised by the commissions of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>, <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>); then the "Ritus servandus in celebratione miss&aelig;", in thirteen paragraphs or chapters. This latter gives exact directions for High or Low Mass, whether celebrated by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Third come the directions about what to do in case of various accidents or defects, headed "De defectibus in celebratione miss&aelig; occurrentibus", in ten chapters. A private preparation and thanksgiving for Mass follow "to be made at the opportunity of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> said while vesting come at the end of the preparation. Lastly, figures show the way to <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> the altar and oblation. Shorter and special <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> for various occasions are inserted (in red) in the text.

<p>Then follows the text of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. The first part contains the "Proper of the time" (<em>Proprium temporis</em>) from the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> to the last after Pentecost. The Proper of each Mass is given in order of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> year, that is the Masses of each Sunday and other day (vigils, ember-days, feri&aelig; in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>) that has a proper Mass. Only <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> and its cycle of feasts (to the octave of the Epiphany), although fixed to days of the civil year (25 Dec., etc.), come in this part. Certain rites, not Eucharistic, but connected closely with the Mass, are in their place in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, such as the blessing of ashes, candles, and palms, all the morning services of <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a> (except the <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> of Thursday and Friday). After the service of <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> the whole Ordinary of the Mass with the Canon is inserted. This is the (almost) unchanging framework into which the various Propers are fitted. Its place in the book has varied considerably at different times; it is now put here, not so much for mystic or symbolic reasons, as because it is a convenient place, about the middle where a book lies open best (see <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">CANON OF THE MASS</a>). The eleven proper Prefaces, and all changes that can occur in the Canon (except the modifications on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>), are printed here, in the Ordinary. Then follows <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Day</a> and the rest of the year in order. The second part of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> contains the Proper of Saints (<em>Proprium missarum de sanctis</em>), that is, the feasts that occur on days of the civil year. It begins with the Vigil of St. Andrew (29 Nov.), as occurring at about the beginning of <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>, and continues (leaving out <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> and its cycle) regularly through the months to the feasts of St. Silvester and <a href="../cathen/11771a.htm">St. Peter of Alexandria</a> (26 Nov.).

<p>The third part is always paged anew in brackets, [I], etc. It contains the Common Masses (<em>Commune Sanctorum</em>), that is, general Masses for Apostles, Martyrs and so on, that are very commonly used for <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of each class, often with proper Collect Secret, and Postcommunion. Most <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> days give the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a>: "All of the Common of a Confessor Pontiff (or whatever it may be) except the following <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>". A collection of votive Masses of various kinds follows, ending with the Mass for a wedding (<em>Pro Sponso et Sponsa</em>), then thirty-five sets of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> (<em>Orationes divers&oelig;</em>) that may be used on certain occasions in Mass, according to the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a>. The four Masses for the dead come next, then twelve sets of <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers for the dead</a>. Then the rite of blessing <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a> and the Asperges <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. Eleven forms of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> (Sacramentals) used by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> of vestments, altar-linen, and the tabernacle or <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a> (used by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> having a special faculty), and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> (Collect, Secret Hanc Igitur, Postcommunion) said at <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> Masses end the old part of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. There follow, however, the ever-growing supplements. Of these first come a collection of votive Masses appointed by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> for each day of the week, then special Masses allowed for certain <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> (<em>Miss&oelig; aliquibus in locis celebrand&oelig;</em>), now forming a second Proper of Saints nearly as long as the old one; and finally with the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> is bound up another supplement (paged with asterisks, I., etc.) for whatever country or province or <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order uses it. The <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> contains all the music used by the celebrant at the altar (except the obvious chants of Dominus vobiscum, Collects, etc., that are given once for all in the "C&aelig;rimoniale Episcoporum") in its place. The new (Vatican) edition gives the various new chants at the end.

<p>The Lectionary (<em>Lectionarium Romanum</em>) contains the Epistles and Gospels from the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, the Gradual (<em>Gradule Romanum</em>), all the choir's part (the Proper, <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a>, etc., and the common, Kyrie. etc.) with music. Religious orders that have a special rite (Dominicans, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>) have of course their special Missals, arranged in the same way.
<h3 id="B">The Pontifical</h3>

<p>The (<em>Pontificale Romanum</em>) is the bishop's-book. It was issued by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (1740-58) on 25 March, 1752, and revised by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in 1888. It has three parts and an appendix. Part I contains the rites of Confirmation, the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>, the seven ordinations, the blessing of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, abbesses, <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of kings and queens, and blessing of a <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> (<em>miles</em>). Part II contains the services for laying foundation-stones, consecrating churches, altars, <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalices</a>, many episcopal <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> (of vestments, vessels, crosses, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, bells, weapons, and flags), the seven penitential psalms, and the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a>. Part III contains the publication of movable feasts on the Epiphany, the expulsion of public penitents on <a href="../cathen/01775b.htm">Ash Wednesday</a> and their reconciliation on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>, the order of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, degradations from each order, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from it, of the journeys of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> (<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to be said then), visitation of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, solemn reception of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, emperors, kings, and such people down to a "Princess of great power", the old episcopal scrutiny, a <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> for the first shaving of a clerk's <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a>, and a little rite for making or degrading a <a href="../cathen/03306a.htm">singer</a> (<em>psalmista</em> or <em>cantor</em>). The appendix of the Pontifical contains the various rites of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the ordinations without music, marriage performed by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the pontifical <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> and blessing after the sermon at High Mass, the "Apostolic Benediction", and a blessing of <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">Holy Water</a> to reconcile a church after it has been execrated (polluted). A supplement adds the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a church with many altars, of an altar alone, and of a <a href="../cathen/01348b.htm">portable altar</a> &#151; all without the chant. A number of extracts from the Pontifical are made, the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> rites, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a church, and so on. These are not specially authorized; they are authentic if they conform to the original. The revision of the plain song has not yet touched the Pontifical. When it does, this will necessitate a new edition.
<h3 id="C">The Breviary</h3>

<p>The (<em>Breviarium Romanum</em>) contains all the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> without chant. It has been revised by the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> (<a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>, <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>) as the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. It begins with the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, the chapter about the calendar, the paschal tables, tables of movable feasts, calendar, like the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. Then follow the general <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> (<em>Rubric&oelig; generales breviarii</em>) in thirty-six chapters, giving full directions for the recital of the office, occurrence of feasts, and so on. Further tables of occurrences, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to be said before and after the office, and a table of absolutions and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> end the introductory matter. The actual text begins with the psalter, that is the psalms arranged for the week, with their normal <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>. First come <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> and <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a> for Sunday; then Prime, <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a>, Sext, and None, then <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> and <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a> for each weekday. After <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a> for Saturday follow <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> for each day, then <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a>. This ends the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalterium</a>. The offices for each day follow, arranged exactly as in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> (Proper of the season, Proper of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, Common of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, <a href="../cathen/15510a.htm">votive Offices</a> and Offices for the dead, the supplement for certain places, and a local supplement). After the Office for the dead some extraneous matter is inserted, namely the <a href="../cathen/06718a.htm">Gradual psalms</a>, <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the dying, blessing for the dying, grace at meals, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> on a journey. At the end of the whole book come the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> before and after Mass and two private <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a> (of the Holy Name and of the Blessed Virgin).

<p>As the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, in spite of its name, is now a very large and cumbersome book, it is generally issued in four parts (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn). This involves a good deal of repetition; the whole <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> occurs in each part, and all feasts that may overlap into the next part have to be printed twice. The first volume only (Winter, which begins with <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>) contains the general <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a>. It is now also usual to reprint the psalms that occur in the Common of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> instead of merely referring back to the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a>. Many other parts are also reprinted in several places. On the number and judicious arrangement of these reprints depends the convenience of any particular edition of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>. Already in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the countless <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> are fond of promising the purchaser that he will find all the offices complete without references ("omnia exscripta sine recursu", "tout le long sans recquerir"), a statement that the writer, after examining a great number of them, has never once found <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. The chief book excerpted from the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> is the "Day Hours" (<em>Hor&oelig; diurn&oelig; breviarii romani</em>), containing everything except <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>, which with its lessons forms the main bulk of the book. For singing in choir various books with music exist, representing still more or less the state of things before Breviaries were invented. The complete "Liber Antiphonarius" contains all the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and responses throughout the Office. From this again various excerpts are made. For the offices most commonly sung in churches we have the Vesperal (<em>Vesperale Romanum</em>), containing <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> and <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a>. The monastic orders (<a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, etc.), the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>, and several local <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> still have their own Breviaries. For the various attempts at replacing our <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> by a radically reformed one (especially that of Cardinal Qui&ntilde;&oacute;nez in 1535) see the article <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">BREVIARY</a> and the histories of Baumer and Batiffol.
<h3 id="D">The Ritual</h3>

<p>The (<em>Rituale Romanum</em>) contains all the services a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> needs besides those of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>. This book especially was the least uniform in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Almost every <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> had its own Ritual, or Agenda. <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> issued in 1614 a book meant to be used everywhere; <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> revised it in 1752. The <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a> contains ten titles (<em>tituli</em>) and an appendix nearly as big again as all the rest. Title I gives general directions for administering Sacraments; II gives all the forms for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; III for penance; IV for the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, V for extreme unction and the care of the sick; VI relates to funerals and gives the Office for the dead from the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>; VII relates to matrimony; VIII contains a large collection of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> for various objects; IX deals with processions; X with <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcisms</a> and forms for filling up in the books of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> (the books of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, confirmation, marriage, the state of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and the dead). The appendix (paged anew with asterisks) gives additional directions for the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, some decrees and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and a large collection of <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>, first "unreserved", then those to be used only by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who have a special faculty, those reserved to certain <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, and many "newest <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>". There is still a great want of uniformity in the use of this book. Many countries, provinces, and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> have their own Ritual or "Ordo administrandi Sacramenta", etc.
<h3 id="E">The Ceremonial of Bishops</h3>

<p>The (<em>C&oelig;rimoniale Episcoporum</em>) in spite of its title contains much matter needed by other people than <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. It is entirely a book of <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrical</a> directions, succeeding the old "Ordines Romani". Much of it is already contained in the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, Pontifical, and Ritual. It was first issued by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> in 1600, then revised by <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> (1650), <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> at various dates (finally 1752), and <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (1882). It has three books. The first contains general directions for episcopal functions, and for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> attendants (master of ceremonies, <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacristan</a>, canons, and so on). Then come full directions for everything connected with Mass, the altar, vestments, ceremonies, etc.; finally the order of a synod. Book II is all about the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, its chanting in choir and all the ritual belonging to it, as well as certain special functions (the blessing of candles, ashes, palms, the <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a> services, processions, etc.). Book III is about various extra-liturgical functions, visits of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to governors of provinces, solemn receptions and so on, finally conduct for <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. The book continually gives directions, not only for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> but for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, too, at these functions. It is also here that one finds some of the most ordinary chants used by any celebrant (e.g., the Dominus vobiscum, Collects, I, 27; Confiteor, II, 39). The <a href="../cathen/03133a.htm">"C&aelig;remoniale Episcoporum"</a> is thus the official and indispensable supplement to the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, Ritual, and Pontifical.
<h3 id="F">The Memorial of Rites</h3>

<p>The (<em>Memoriale Rituum</em>) or Little Ritual (<em>Rituale parvum</em>) is the latest of these official books. It gives directions for certain rites (the blessing of candles, ashes, palms, the <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a> services) in small churches where there are no <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> (<a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>). The <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> always supposes the presence of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> at these functions; so there was <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> and confusion about them when carried out by a single <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> (1724-30) published this book in 1725 to remove the confusion in the smaller <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> (1800-23) extended it to all small churches of the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> in 1821. It is therefore the official norm for all such services without <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>.
<h3 id="G">The Martyrology</h3>

<p>The (<em>Martyrologium Romanum</em>) is an enlarged calendar giving the names and very short accounts of all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> (not only <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>) commemorated in various places each day. The earliest known <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrologies</a> go back to the fourth century. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> there were, as usual, many versions of the book. Our present Roman Martyrology was arranged in 1584 by Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> under <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>, and revised four times, in 1628, 1675, 1680, and (by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>) 1748. It is read in choir at Prime.
<h2 id="section4">Liturgical books of other rites</h2>

<p>Of these little need be said here. They are described in the articles on the various rites. The other two surviving rites in the West (of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and the Mozarabic Rite) have gone through the same development as the Roman &#151; from Sacramentaries, Lectionaries, <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalters</a>, and Antiphonaries to Missals, Pontificals, and Breviaries. Only of course their books contain their own <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and ritual. The latest editions of the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> (Ambrosian) <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, Ritual etc., are published by Giacomo Agnelli at the Archiepiscopal Press (<em>tipografia arcivescovile</em>) at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. The classical edition of the Mozarabic books is that made by order of Cardinal Ximenes (<a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo, 1495-1517). The <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> (Missale mistum [for <em>mixtum</em>] secundum regulam beati Isidori dictum Mozarabes) was printed at Toledo in 1500 (reprinted in P.L., LXXXV), the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> (<em>Breviarium Gothicum</em>) reprinted (with Romanizing additions) at Toledo in 1502 (P.L., LXXXVI). None of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> has yet made such compendiums of its books as our <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>. All their books are still in the state in which ours were in the days of Sacramentaries, Antiphonaries, and so on. One reason for this is that in the East our reduplications are unknown. There the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> does not also say at the altar the parts sung by the readers and choir. Nor has there been any development (except a rudimentary beginning, chiefly among the Uniats) of private recitation of the Office. So their books are only wanted for the choir; the various readers and singers use different volumes of what in some rites is quite a large <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>.

<p>The Byzantine Books are the Typikon, a kind of perpetual calendar with directions for all services, the Euchologion, containing all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> wants for the Holy Liturgy and other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and rites (almost exactly the old Latin Sacramentary). The Triodion, Pentekostarion, Oktoechos, and Horologion contain the choir's part of the Liturgy and Office throughout the year. The <a href="../cathen/10177b.htm">Menaia</a> and <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">Menologion</a> contain the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> offices; the Psalterion explains itself. The Apostolos and Evangelion contain the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> lessons (these books are described in <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">THE RITE OF CONSTANTINOPLE</a>). There are many editions. In Greek the Orthodox books are published at the Ph&oelig;nix Press (formerly at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, now Patras), the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> books by the Roman <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. Each national Church has further its own editions in its <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language. The books of other <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> correspond more or less to these, but in most cases they are more confused, less known, sometimes not even yet edited. In the very vague state of most of their books one can only say in general that these churches have an indefinite collection, each service having its own book. These are then collected and arranged in all kinds of groups and compendiums by various editors. The <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> compendiums have a natural tendency to imitate the arrangement of the Roman books. The most obvious cases of liturgical books are always the Lectionaries, then the Book of Liturgies. The others are mostly in a very vague state.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Books (all in Syriac) are the Liturgy (containing their three <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>), the Gospel (<em>Evangelion</em>), Apostle (<em>Shlicha</em>) and Lessons (<em>Kariane</em>), the "Turgama" (Interpretation), containing <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> sung by <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> at the liturgy (our Graduals and Sequences), the David (<em>Dawidha</em> = <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a>), "Khudhra" (= "cycle", containing <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, responsories, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and collects for all <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>), "Kash K&otilde;l" (= "Collection of all"; the same chants for week-days), "Kdham u-Wathar" (= "Before and after"; certain <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, psalms, and collects most often used, from the other books), "Gezza" ("Treasury", services for feast-days), Abu-Halim (the name of the compiler, containing collects for the end of the <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturns</a> on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>), "Bautha d'Ninwaie" (= "Prayer of the Ninevites", a collection of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">St. Ephraem</a>, used in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>). The Baptism Office ("Taksa d'Amadha") is generally bound up with the Liturgies. The "Taksa d'Siamidha" has the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> services. The "Taksa d'Husaia" contains the office for Penance, the "Kthawa d'Burrakha" is the marriage service, the "Kahneita", the burial of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the "Annidha" that of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. Lastly the "Khamis" and "Warda" are further collections of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> (see Badger, "The Nestorians and their Rituals", London, 1852, II, 16-25). Naturally not every church possesses this varied collection of books. The most <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> ones are printed by the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> missionaries at Urmi for the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> (Chaldean) books are printed, some at <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, some by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at Mosul ("Missale chaldaicum", 1845; "Manuale Sacerdotum", 1858; "Breviarium chaldaicum", 1865). A Chaldean "Breviary" was published in three volumes at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1886-7, edited by P&egrave;re Bedgan, a missionary of the Congr&eacute;gation des Missions. The Malabar schismatics use the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> books, the Uniats have books revised (much romanized) by the Synod of Diamper (1599; it ordered all their old books to be burned). The <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> Malabar "Missal" was published at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1774, the "Ordo rituum et lectionum" in 1775.

<p>The Coptic Books (in Coptic with Arabic <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a>, and generally with the text transliterated in Arabic characters too) are the Euchologion (Kit&atilde;b al-Khulagi almuqaddas), very often (but quite wrongly) called <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. This corresponds to the Byzantine Euchologion. Then the Lectionary called "Katam&atilde;rus", the "Synaks&atilde;r", containing legends of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, the "Deacon's Manual", an Antiphonary (called <em>Difn&atilde;ri</em>), the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a>, Theotokia (containing offices of the B. V. M.), Doxologia, collections of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> for the choir and a number of smaller books for the various other offices. These books were first grouped and arranged for the Uniats by Raphael Tuki, and printed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the eighteenth century. Their arrangement is obviously an imitation of that of the Latin service-books ("Missale coptice et arabice", 1736; "Diurnum alexandrinum copto-arabicum", 1750; "Pontificale et Euchologium", 1761, 1762; "Rituale coptice et arabice", 1763; "Theotokia", 1764). Lord Cyril II, the present <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> Coptic patriarch, has published a "missal", "ritual", and "Holy Week book" (Cairo, 1898-1902). The <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> have a very sumptuously printed set of their books, edited by Gladios Labib, in course of publication at Cairo ("Katam&atilde;rus", 1900-2; "Euchologion", 1904; "Funeral Service", 1905).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> service-books are (except the Liturgy) the least known of any. Hardly anything of them has been published, and no one seems yet to have made a systematic investigation of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>. Since the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> Rite is derived from the Coptic, one may conjecture that their books correspond more or less to the Coptic books. One may also no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> conjecture that their books are still in the primitive state of (more or less) a special book for each service. One has not heard of any collections or compendiums. Peter the Ethiopian (Petrus Ethyops) published the Liturgy with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> service and some <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> at the end of his edition of the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopic</a> <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> (Tasfa Sion, Rome, 1548). Various students have published fragments of the Rite in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> (cf. Chaine, "Grammaire &eacute;thiopienne", <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a>, 1907; bibliography, p. 269), but these can hardly be called service-books.

<p>The Jacobite (and <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a>) Syrian Rite has never been published as a whole. A fragment of the liturgy was published in Syriac and Latin at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> (1572) by <a href="../cathen/05745a.htm">Fabricius</a> Boderianus (D. Seven alexandrini . . . de ritibus baptismi et sacr&aelig; Synaxis). The Uniats have an Euchologion (Syriac and Karshuni), published at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1843 (Missale Syriacum), and a "Book of clerks used in the ecclesiastical ministries" (Liber ministerii, Syriac only, Beirut, 1888). The <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, collected like a <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, was published at Mosul in seven volumes (1886-96), the <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferial</a> office alone at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1853, and at Sharfi in the Lebanon (1898). A Ritual &#151; "Book of Ceremony" &#151; for the Syrian Uniats is issued by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> have an abundance of liturgical books for their romanized Syrian Rite. The <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> Synod at Deir al-Luweize (1736) committed a uniform preparation of all their books to the patriarch (Part II, Sess. I, xiii, etc.) These books are all referred to in Roman terms (Missal, Ritual, Pontifical, etc.). The <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> (in this case the name is not incorrect) was published at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1592 and 1716, since then repeatedly, in whole or in part, at <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a>. Little books containing the Ordinary of the Liturgy with the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> commonly used are issued by many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> booksellers at <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a>. The "Book of the Minister" (containing the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> and other <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers'</a> parts of the Liturgy) was published at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1596 and at <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a> in 1888. The "Ferial Office", called <em>Fard</em>, "Burden" or "Duty" (the only one commonly used by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>), was issued at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1890, at <a href="../cathen/02392a.htm">Beirut</a> in 1900. The whole <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> began to be published at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1666, but only two volumes of the summer part appeared. A Ritual with various additional <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> was issued at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1839. All <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> books are in Syriac and Karshuni.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Liturgical Books are quite definitely drawn up, arranged, and authorized. They are the only other set among <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> whose arrangement can be compared to those of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>. There are eight official <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> service-books: <ul><li>(1) the Directory, or Calendar, corresponding to the Byzantine Typikon, <li>(2) the Manual of Mysteries of the Sacred Oblation (= an Euchologion), <li>(3) the Book of Ordinations, often bound up with the former, <li>(4) the Lectionary, <li>(5) the Hymn-book (containing the variable <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of the Liturgy), <li>(6) the Book of Hours (containing the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> and, generally, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> part of the Liturgy), <li>(7) the Book of Canticles (containing the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of the Office), <li>(8) the <em>Mashdotz</em>, or Ritual (containing the rites of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>).</ul>

<p>The books of both Gregorian and <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> have been published a great number of times; the latest Gregorian editions are those of Constantinople and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> ones have been issued at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and especially <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> (at S. Lazaro). There are many extracts from them, especially from the Liturgy.

<p>In conclusion it will be noticed that the Eastern and the older Western liturgical books consider rather the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who uses them than the service at which they are used. The same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> has the same book, whatever the function may be. On the other hand the later Western books are so arranged that all the service (whoever may be saying it) is put together in one book; our books are arranged by services, not according to their users. This is the result of our modern Western principle that every one (or at any rate the chief <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, the celebrant) says everything, even if it is at the same time said by some one else.
