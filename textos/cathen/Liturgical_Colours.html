<h1>Liturgical Colours</h1>  

<p>By a law of her liturgy the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> directs that the vestments worn by her sacred <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, and the drapery used in the decoration of the altar should correspond in colour to that which is prescribed for the Office of the day. The colours thus sanctioned by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in connection with her public worship are called the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> colours. Here it will be enough to examine (1) their number; (2) the drapery and vestments affected by them; (3) their <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>; (4) their antiquity, and (5) their symbolism.
<h2 id="section1">Number</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, since <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>, colours are five in number, viz.: white, red, green, violet, and black. Rose colour is employed only on L&aelig;tare and Gaudete <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>. Blue is prescribed in some <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> for the Mass of the Immaculate Conception.

<p>White is the colour proper to <a href="../cathen/15058a.htm">Trinity Sunday</a>, the feasts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, except those of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, the feasts of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, confessors, virgins and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who are not <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, the Nativity of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>, the chief feast of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a>, the feast of the Chains and of the Chair of St. Peter, the Conversion of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, All Saints, to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of churches and altars, the anniversaries of the election and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and of the election and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; also for the octaves of these feasts and the Offices <em>de tempore</em> from <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> to the vigil of Pentecost; it is used for votive Masses when the feasts have white, and for the nuptial Mass; also in services in connection with the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, at the burial of children, in the administration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Holy Viaticum</a>, and matrimony.

<p>Red is used the week of Pentecost, on the feasts of <a href="../cathen/11535a.htm">Christ's Passion</a> and His Precious Blood, the Finding and <a href="../cathen/05380b.htm">Elevation</a> of the Cross, the feasts of Apostles and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; and in votive Masses of these feasts. It is used on <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Holy Innocents</a> if the feast occur on Sunday and always on its octave.

<p>Green is employed in Offices <em>de tempore</em> from the octave of the Epiphany to <a href="../cathen/13721b.htm">Septuagesima</a>, and from the octave of Pentecost to <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>, except on ember-days and vigils during that time, and on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> occurring within an octave.

<p>Violet is used during <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> and from <a href="../cathen/13721b.htm">Septuagesima</a> to <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, on vigils that are fast days, and on ember-days, except the vigil of Pentecost and the ember-days during the octave of Pentecost. Violet is also used for Mass on rogation-days, for votive Masses of the Passion and of penitential character, at the blessing of candles and of <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>. The stole used in the administration of penance and of extreme unction and in the first part of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> ceremonies must be violet.

<p>Black is used in offices for the dead, and on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Affected vestments</h2>

<p>The drapery and vestments affected by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> colours are (a) the antependium of the altar, and as a matter of appropriateness, the tabernacle veil; (b) the <a href="../cathen/03084b.htm">burse</a> and <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> veil; (c) <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a>, stole, <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a>, cope, and humeral veil; (d) <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a>, stole, tunic, and <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a> of the sacred <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, and also the broad stole and folded <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a> when employed. All these must correspond with the rules prescribing the use of each colour. The <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrical</a> prescriptions regard the main or constitutive portion of each vestment, so that the borders or other ornamental accessories do not determine the quality of colour. Neither does the lining, but the Roman practice is to have it in harmony with the vestment itself, yellow however being generally adopted instead of pure white.
<h2 id="section3">Obligation</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of using any particular colour begins with the First <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> of the Office of which it is characteristic, or with the <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> if the Office has no First <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, and ceases as soon as the following Office begins. Vestments made of pure cloth of gold may be employed for red, white, and green colours (Decret. Authent., nn. 3145, 3646, ed. 1900); cloth of silver may be used instead of white. Multicoloured vestments cannot be used except for the predominant colour.
<h2 id="section4">Antiquity</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (De Sacro Sacrificio Miss&aelig; I, VIII, n. 16) says that up to the fourth century white was the only <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> colour in use. Other colours were introduced soon afterwards. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (d. 1216) is among the first to emphasize a distinction. He mentions four principal colours, white, red, green, black (De Sac. Alt. Mys., I, lxv) as of general use, and one, viz. violet, as occasionally employed. This latter was regularly used from the thirteenth century. An "Ordo Romanus" of the fourteenth century enumerates five. Between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries blue and yellow were common but they may not be used without very special authorization (Cong. of Rites, Sept., 1837).
<h2 id="section5">Symbolism</h2>

<p>Outside of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> uniformity of observance was effected in the second quarter of the nineteenth century by the abrogation of other uses. In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> only the Ambrosian Rite retains its peculiar colours. Most of the Oriental rites have no prescribed <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> colours. The <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> alone has a fixed usage but even among them it is not of strict <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> follow the Roman regulation since 1891. The variety of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> colours in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> arose from the mystical meaning attached to them. Thus white, the symbol of light, typifies innocence and purity, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and glory; red, the language of fire and blood, indicates burning charity and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs'</a> generous sacrifice; green, the hue of plants and trees, bespeaks the hope of life eternal; violet, the gloomy cast of the mortified, denotes affliction and melancholy; while black, the universal emblem of mourning, signifies the sorrow of death and the sombreness of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>.
