<h1>Liturgical Use of Creeds</h1>  

<p>The public use of creeds began in connection with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, in the <em>Traditio</em> and <em>Redditio symboli</em>, as a preparation for that sacrament, and in the preliminary interrogations. This use is found as early as the "Canons" of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> and the "Catecheses" of <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, and is so universal as to be probably of still earlier date. (Cf. <a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs37">Acts 8:37</a>) The recitation of the Nicaeo-Constantinopolitan Creed at the Eucharist seems to have begun, according to Theodore the Reader, at Antioch under Peter the Fuller in 471 (though <a href="../cathen/08277b.htm">James of Edessa</a> says that it was adopted as soon as it was composed), and to have been adopted at Constantinople by the Patriarch Timotheus in 511. Both intended to protest, as <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, against Chalcedonian "innovations", but in spite of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> origin the practice spread, though <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> did not finally adopt it until the eleventh century. The <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a> is the only one in use in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a>, whether Orthodox, <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a>, or in the corresponding <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> bodies, though the East Syrians, both <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> have a variant of their own (see <a href="../cathen/14413a.htm">EAST SYRIAN RITE</a>) which may have been originally understood in a <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> sense, and the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> and <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinians</a> have also a shortened form for use at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, besides the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a>, which it recites only at Mass, uses also the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> and the so-called Athanasian. These three creeds have been retained in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> Rite. The following is the use of creeds in various rites:
<h2>Baptism</h2>

<ul> <li><em>Roman:</em> <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> in full, followed by a shortened creed in interrogative form. <li><em>Ambrosian, Gallican, and Mozarabic:</em> nearly the same. <li><em>Celtic:</em> either the Apostles' creed in full or a shortened form, both as interrogatives. <li><em><a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a></em>, complete <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> in interrogative form. <li><em>Orthodox Eastern:</em> <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a> in full in the preliminary <em>euchai eis to poiesai katechoumenon</em>. <li><em>West Syrian</em> (Jacobite, Syrian <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a>) and <em>Armenian:</em> <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a> in full. <li><em>East Syrian:</em> variant of <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a> in a similar position to that which it holds in the Eucharist, on the model of which the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> service is constructed. <li><em>Coptic and &AElig;thiopic:</em> a short confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Trinity, the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. </ul>
<h2>Eucharist</h2>

<p>All rites use the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a>, though in different positions, as part of the declaration of fellowship (of which the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">Kiss</a> of Peace is another part) with which the <em>Missa Fidelium</em> begins. This aspect is removal of the <em>Pax</em> to another position. The positions are: <ul><li>Immediately after the Gospel: <em>Roman, Celtic, <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>.</em> <li>After the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>, but quite unconnected with the <em>Pax: Ambrosian.</em> There is good reason to think that the Ambrosian <em>Pax</em> originally came, not as now in the Roman position, but at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>. <li>After dismissal of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> and <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>, but before the <em>Pax:</em> <em>Coptic, Greek St. James, West Syrian, East Syrian.</em> <li>After dismissal, <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> and <em>Pax: Orthodox Eastern.</em> (Byzantine), <em>Greek St. Mark.</em> <li>After the Consecration, during the Fraction: <em>Mozarabic.</em> This last seems to follow the use ordered by the Emperor Justin at Constantinople, that the Creed should be said before the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Pater Noster</a> at Mass, but it is probably of much later introduction. </ul>
<h2>The divine office</h2>

<ul><li><em>Roman:</em> <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> at the beginning of <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> and Prime, ferially with <em>preces</em> in the course of Prime and <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a>, and at the end of <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a>. Athanasian on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> at Prime. The earliest mention of this is in the "Capitulare" of Hayto, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Basle, c. 820. Many Roman derivatives (e.g. the Sarum) said the Athanasian daily at Prime. The monastic rites and the French breviaries of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries mostly follow the Roman practice. <li><em>Ambrosian:</em> the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> in the course of Prime and <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a>, the Athanasian daily at Prime. <li><em>Mozarabic:</em> The <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a> at Prime on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and festivals. This was ordered by the Council of Toledo of 589. <li><em>Celtic:</em> The <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> is given with the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Pater Noster</a> in the "Bangor Antiphoner", and at the end of the sketch service in the "Book of Mulling", but there is no evidence how it was used. <li><em><a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a>:</em> The <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> is said with <em>preces</em> at morning and evening <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, daily, except that on thirteen fast-days (roughly, once a month, and on <a href="../cathen/15058a.htm">Trinity Sunday</a>) the Athanasian takes its place at morning <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. <li><em>Byzantine:</em> <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a> at the Midnight Office (<em>mesonyktikon</em>) after the Psalms, except on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, and at the Little <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a> (<em>apodeipnon mikron</em>) after the Great Doxology. <li><em>East Syrian:</em> <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a> at the end of the morning and evening services. <li><em>Coptic:</em> At the "Offering of the Morning Incense", at <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>, <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a>, and the "Prayer of the Curtain". </ul>
<h2>Other uses</h2>

<p>Other uses of creeds are: <ul> <li>The <em>Ambrosian</em> uses either the Apostles' or <a href="../cathen/02033b.htm">Athanasian Creed</a> in the "Ordo Commendationis Animae". <li>The <em>Celtic</em> used either the full <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> or a shortened confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Trinity, eternal life, and the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> (both forms are found) before the unction of the sick. <li>The <em><a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a></em> uses the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> in an interrogative form (as at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>) the visitation of the sick. <li>The <em>Mozarabic</em> introduces a three-fold repetition of a Spanish variant of the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> into a "Sermo ad populum" before the Epistle at Mass on <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>, which is the ancient <em>Traditio Symboli.</em> <li>The <em>Byzantine</em> has a recitation, <em>megalophonos</em> of the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a> in answer to the question, <em>kai ti pisteueis</em> at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. This is followed by two more elaborate confessions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, resembling the "Interrogatio" at the same service in the Roman Pontifical. <li>In the <em>Roman</em> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> is recited just before the <em>Accipe Spiritum Sanctum.</em> <li>At the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of the Russian emperor he is required to recite the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a> in token of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. </ul>
