<h1>Liturgical Use of Fire</h1>  

<p>Fire is one of the most expressive and most ancient of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> symbols. All the creeds of antiquity accorded a prominent place to this element whose mysterious nature and irresistible power frequently caused it to be adored as a god. The sun, as the principle of heat and light for the earth, was regarded as an igneous mass and had its share in this worship. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> adapted this usual <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, but denied the divine title to heat and light, and made them the symbols of the divinity, which enlightens and warms humanity. The symbolism led quite naturally to the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> rite by which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on the <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Eve of Easter</a> celebrates the mystery of the Death and <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of which the extinguished and rekindled fire furnishes the expressive image. The beginning of the office also reflects ancient <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>. The new fire is struck from a flint and is blessed with this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: <blockquote> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, Almighty Father, inextinguishable light, Who hast created all light, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> this light sanctified and blessed by Thee, Who hast enlightened the whole world; make us enlightened by that light and inflamed with the fire of Thy brightness; and as Thou didst enlighten Moses when he went out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, so illuminate our hearts and senses that we may attain life and light everlasting through Christ our Lord. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. </blockquote>

<p>When the fire has been struck from the flint the three-branched candle is lighted and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> chants the <a href="../cathen/05730b.htm">"Exultet"</a>, a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> poem whose style is as lively and charming as the melody which accompanies it. It is yet preserved in the Roman Liturgy. In the East the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the new fire occupies a place of considerable importance in the paschal ritual of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. This <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> is the occasion for <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> demonstrations of a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> which frequently degenerates into orgies worthy of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> rites. The Journal of the Marquis de Nointel, in the seventeenth century, relates scenes which cannot be transcribed and which take place periodically. This <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> is peculiar to the Holy City and does not figure in the ordinary Byzantine ritual.

<p>In the West we see the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, as early as the sixth century, lighting large fires at nightfall on the <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Eve of Easter</a>. The correspondence of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> with Pope Zachary furnishes a curious detail on this subject. These fires were kindled, not with brands from other fires, but with lenses; they were therefore new fires. There is no trace of this custom in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, where the Merovingian <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> are silent on the point. It is difficult to say what took place in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, for although the Mozarabic <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> contains a blessing of fire at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">vigil of Easter</a>, it can hardly be admitted that this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was primitive. It may have been inserted in this <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missal</a> at a later date as it was in the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, in the case of which fire is obtained from a flint and steel. It is possible that the custom, of Breton or Celtic origin, was imposed upon the Anglo-Saxons, and the missionaries of that nation brought it to the continent in the eighth century. An altogether different rite, though of similar meaning, was followed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a>, at the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03696b.htm">holy chrism</a>, there was collected in all the lamps of the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran basilica</a> a quantity of oil sufficient to fill three large vases deposited in the corner of the church. Wicks burned in this oil until the night of <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>, when there were lighted from these lamps the candles and other luminaries by which, during the <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Eve of Easter</a>, light was thrown on the ceremonies of the administration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. The rite must have been attended with a certain solemnity since the letter of Pope Zachary to <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> prescribes that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, perhaps even a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, should officiate on this occasion. Unhappily we are reduced to this somewhat vague information, for neither the Roman "Ordines", nor the Sacramentaries tell us anything concerning this <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. This blessing of the <a href="../cathen/11515b.htm">paschal candle</a> and the fire at the beginning of <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Easter Eve</a> is foreign to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The large lamps prepared on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a> provided fire on the Friday and Saturday without necessitating the solemn production of a new fire. The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the Purification or <a href="../cathen/03245b.htm">Candlemas</a> (2 February) has a celebrated rite with ancient <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> concerning the emission of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> fire and light. One of them invokes Christ as "the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light which enlightenest every man that cometh into this world". The canticle of Simeon, "Nunc Demittis", is chanted with the anthem "A light (which my eyes have seen) for the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and for the glory of thy people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>."
