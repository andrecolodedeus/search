<h1>Liturgical Use of Water</h1>  

<p>Besides the <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a> which is used by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in so many of her rites of blessing, and besides the water employed in the <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">washing of feet</a> and hands (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">WASHING OF FEET AND HANDS</a>) and in the <a href="../cathen/02274a.htm">baptismal font</a>, water has its recognized place in the ritual of every Mass and in a certain number of pontifical and extraordinary offices which include some form of washing.

<p>With regard to the water mingled with the wine in the Mass, the Fathers from the earliest times have tried to find reasons why the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> uses a mixed <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> though the Gospel narrative implies that Christ <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> pure wine. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (Ep. lxiii, 13) discussing this question sees an analogy to the union of Christ with His faithful people, but, as the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> points out (Sess. XXII, De Missa, vii), there is besides this a reference to the flowing of blood and water from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> side, from which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the dispensatrix of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, was formed, like a new Eve from the side of the new Adam. It was probably in allusion to the former symbolism (i.e. the union of the people with Christ) that the earlier "Ordines romani" directed the choir (<em>schola cantorum</em>) to present water at the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> of the Mass. We may note also that it has long been the practice of the Greek <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> to pour a little hot water into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> immediately before the Communion, and though there seems no reliable evidence for any such custom in the early centuries, the absence of this usage among the Latins is made by the Greeks a serious ground of reproach. In the purification of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, water is again used in the second of the ablutions, but the present practice according to which the ablution of wine and water is drunk by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> did not always obtain in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. On the other hand there was a very general custom of providing water, or wine and water, for the communicants to drink as a "purification" after Communion. In fact this is prescribed in the existing <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> (Rit. ser., X, 6), though the <a href="../cathen/03133a.htm">"Caeremoniale episcoporum"</a> on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Day</a> speaks of a purification of wine alone. Further, a strictly <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> use of water is also made in such offices as the laying of the foundation stone of a church and the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a cemetery, though here the blessing consists only of the five <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> commonly used for making ordinary <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>. In the blessing of a bell, however, and in the dedication of a church special features occur. In the case of the bell an entirely new <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, "Benedic, Domine, hanc aquam", is inserted, and with the water thus <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the bell is afterwards completely washed inside and out. For the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a church a special lustral water is prepared after the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has entered the building, and the various ingredients, viz. salt, water, ashes, and wine, before being mixed together, are blessed with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which differ entirely from those employed in the case of <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a> for common use. This lustral water is sprinkled while the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> seven times makes the circuit of the altar and three times that of the interior of the church. The rite of washing the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a> is performed in the Roman <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> and some other churches with a certain solemnity, and was in old times an even more noteworthy function than at present. For this purpose wine and sometimes rose water were employed as well as the pure element. Again at the opening of the holy doors in the Roman <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> when the year of jubilee begins, the penitentiaries, provided with sponges and towels, wash and wipe the threshold, after the previously obstructed door has been unwalled. Less strictly <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> is the use of water which is blessed with various special formulae for devotional purposes. The official "Rituale romanum" contains a number of such <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>, for example "Modus benedicendi aquam" with other similar formulae in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Adelhaid, <a href="../cathen/15645a.htm">St. Willibrord</a>, St. Vincent Ferrer etc., particularly. The purpose of this is generally medicinal and there is in particular a long blessing of the "water of <a href="../cathen/07507a.htm">St. Hubert</a>" against the bite of a mad dog.
