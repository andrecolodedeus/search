<h1>Liturgical Week</h1>  

<p>The week as a measure of time is a sufficiently obvious division of the lunar month, and the discussion carried on with much learning as to whether this seven days' period is ultimately of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> origin has no great importance. In any case the week was regarded as a sacred institution among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> owing to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> rest and its association with the first chapter of Genesis. The earliest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> converts were no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> tenacious of the usages (so far as they were compatible with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Gospel) in which they had been brought up. The <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a>, "the first day of the week" (<a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs7">Acts 20:7</a>; <a href="../bible/1co016.htm#vrs2">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/rev001.htm#vrs10">Revelation 1:10</a>), soon replaced the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> as the great day of religious observance, but the week itself remained as before. Indeed, there is much to recommend the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that in the first and second centuries the only commemorations of the great <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> formed a weekly, not an annual, cycle. Sunday, according to the Epistle of Barnabas (xv), was "the beginning of another world", and the writer further says: "Wherefore also we keep the eighth day for rejoicing, in the which also <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">rose from the dead</a> and having been manifested <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascended into the heavens</a>". Again the <a href="../fathers/0714.htm">Didache (8)</a> ordains: "Let not your fasts be with the hypocrites; for they fast on the second and fifth days of the week, but do ye fast on the foruth and on the Friday", while in c. xiv we are told "And on the Lord's day of the Lord come together and break bread and give thanks". Altogether it becomes clear from the language of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01636a.htm">Apostolic Constitution</a>, and other early writers that the Sunday in each week was regarded as commemorating the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>, and the Wednesday and Friday the betrayal and Passion of Christ. Although this simple primitive conception gave place in time, as feasts were introduced and multiplied, to an annual calendar, the week always retained its importance; this is particularly seen in the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> in the hebdomadal division of the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> for recitation. Amalarius preserves for us the particulars of the arrangement accepted in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> royal at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> in 802 by which the whole <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> was recited in the course of each week. In its broader features the division was identical with that theoretically imposed by the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> until the recent publication of the <a href="../cathen/01636a.htm">Apostolic Constitution</a> "Divine afflatu" on 1 Nov., 1911. Moreover, it appears from Amalarius that the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> arrangement was in substance the same as that already accepted by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. Already in the sixth century, St. Benedict had clearly laid down the principle that the entire <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> was to be recited at least once in the week; indeed a similar arrangement was attributed to Pope St. Damasus. The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of particular days of the week to particular subjects of devotion is also officially recognized by the special Office of the Blessed Virgin on the Saturday, by the Friday Masses of the Passion during <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> and by the arrangement of Votive Offices for special week days approved by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>. For a long time in the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> Thursday in the West was regarded as a sort of lesser feast or Sunday, probably because it was the day of the week on which the <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension</a> fell (cf. <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, "Hist. Eccl.", IV, 25). Again the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> approved after the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> left certain devotion accretions to the Office, e.g. the Office for the Dead, <a href="../cathen/06718a.htm">Gradual Psalms</a>, etc, to be said once a week, particularly on the Mondays of <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> and <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>.
