<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Liturgy of Addeus and Maris</h1>  

<p>This is an Oriental liturgy, sometimes assigned to the Syrian group because it is written in the Syriac tongue; sometimes to the Persian group because it was used in Mesopotamia and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. It is known as the normal liturgy of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, but probably it had been in use before the rise of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. According to tradition, it was composed by Addeus and Maris, who evangelized <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, Seleucia-Ctesiphon and the surrounding country. This tradition is based on the narrative contained in the <a href="../cathen/05088a.htm">" Doctrine of Addai"</a>, a work generally ascribed to the second half of the third century. The account states that King Abgar the Black, having heard of the wonderful works of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, besought <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> to come and cure him of a serious malady, but that he obtained only the promise that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> would send one of His disciples, a promise which was fulfilled after the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">ascension</a>, when Thaddeus (in Syriac, Addai), one of the seventy-two disciples, was sent by <a href="../cathen/14658b.htm">St. Thomas</a> to <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> to cure the King. Addeus and his disciple Maris are said to have <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> the King and people of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, to have organized the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> there, and to have composed the liturgy which bears their names. There seem to be no documents earlier than the <a href="../cathen/05088a.htm">" Doctrine of Addai"</a> to confirm this tradition. Although good historical evidence concerning the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Church of Edessa</a> is wanting, still it is quite certain that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was introduced there at a very early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, since towards the end of the second century the king was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Palouth) of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Serapion of Antioch (1902-03). It was only natural that the Edessans should regard Addeus and Maris as the authors of their liturgy, since they already regarded these men as the founders of their Church. The <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> attribute the final redaction of the text of the Liturgy of Addeus and Maris to their patriarch Jesuyab III who lived about the beginning of the seventh century. After the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> retreated into the Persian kingdom, and penetrated even into <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, founding churches and introducing their liturgy wherever the Syriac language was used. At the present time this liturgy is used chiefly by the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, who reside for the most part in Kurdistan. It is also used by the Chaldean Uniats of the same region, but their liturgy has, of course, been purged of all traces of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> tenets. Finally, it is in use among the Chaldean Uniats of Malabar, but it was very much altered by the Synod of Diamper held in 1599.
<h2>Exposition of parts</h2>

<p>The liturgy may be divided conveniently into two parts: the Mass of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, extending as far as the offertory, when the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> were dismissed, and the Mass of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, embracing all from the offertory to the end. Or again, it may be divided into the preparation for the sacrifice extending as far as the preface, and the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">anaphora</a> or formula for <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> corresponding to the Roman canon. "The order of the Liturgy of the Apostles, composed by Mar Addai and Mar Mari, the blessed Apostles" begins with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>, after which the verse <a href="../cathen/06583a.htm">"Glory to God in the highest"</a> etc. (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs14">Luke 2:14</a>), the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feasts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, or a <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a> of praise to the Trinity on <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> days and ferials are recited. Several psalms are then said, together with the anthem of the sanctuary (variable for <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feasts or Saints' days) and a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of praise and adoration.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> then invites the people "to lift up their voices and glorify the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">living God</a>", and they respond by reciting the Trisagion. Then the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> says a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> the reader of the lessons. Ordinarily two lessons from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> are read, but during Eastertide a lesson from the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> is substituted for the second <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> lesson. After an anthem and a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> reads the third lesson (called the Apostle), which is taken from one of the epistles of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> prepares for the Gospel by reciting the appropriate <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and blessing the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and after the <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">alleluia</a> is sung he reads the Gospel. This is followed by its proper anthem, the diaconal <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a>, and a short <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> recited by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, after which the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> invite the people "to bow their heads for the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> and receive the blessing" which the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> invokes upon them. The Mass of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> is thus concluded, so the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> admonish those who have not received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to depart, and the Mass of the faithful begins. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> offers the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>, reciting the prescribed <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, covers the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> with a large veil, goes down from the altar and begins the anthem of the mysteries. The recital of the Creed at this point is a late addition to the liturgy.

<p>Having entered within the arch, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> makes the prescribed inclinations to the altar, washes his hands and begins the preparatory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the <em><a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">anaphora</a></em>. He recites an invitation to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> corresponding to the Roman <em>Orate fratres</em>, and then beseeches the Lord not to regard his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> nor those of the people, but in all mercy to account him worthy to celebrate the mysteries of the Body and Blood of Christ and worthily praise and worship the Lord, after which he crosses himself and the people answer "Amen." At this point on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feasts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> seems to have read the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>, called by the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> the "Book of the Living and the Dead." The <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a> is then given, and a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> recited for all classes of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the church. The <em><a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">anaphora</a></em> proper begins with the preface. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> now invites the people to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> recites a <a href="../cathen/13673b.htm">secret prayer</a>, lifts the veil from the offerings, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that "the grace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a>, and the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> be with us all now and ever world without end", and signs the mysteries, and the people answer "Amen." The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> then begins the preface with the words: "Lift up your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>." The preface is followed by the sanctus and the <em>anamnesis</em> (commemoration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>). In present usage the words of institution are here inserted, although they seem to have little connection with the context. He pronounces a short <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a>, and signs the mysteries, and the people answer "Amen." After the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> says "<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Pray</a> in your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>. Peace be with us," the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> recites quietly the great intercession or memento. The <em>epiclesis</em>, or invocation of the Holy Ghosts follows as a sort of continuation of the intercession. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> then says a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for peace and one of thanksgiving, and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incenses</a> himself and the oblations, reciting the appropriate <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in the meantime. While the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> recites a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> referring to the Eucharist, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, taking the Host in both hands, says a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> alluding to the life-giving power of this bread which came down from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> (in the Chaldean <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> the words of institution are placed after the first part of this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>), breaks the Host into two parts, one of which he places on the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a>, while with the other he signs the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, and after dipping it into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> signs the other half of the Host, reciting meanwhile the proper <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the consignation. Joining the parts together he says a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> referring to the ceremonies just completed, cleaves with his thumb the Host where it was dipped in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, signs his forehead with his thumb, and recites a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of praise to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and to the Trinity. After <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissing</a> the altar, he invokes a blessing upon all "The grace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>" etc., as quoted above.

<p>While the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> breaks the Host, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> invites the people to consider the meaning of these holy mysteries and to have the proper dispositions for receiving them; to forgive the transgressions of others, and then to beseech the Lord to forgive their own offences. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, continuing this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, introduces the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> (which all recite) and says a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that expands the last two petitions. After a short <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> gives the Chalice to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> the people, and then both distribute Communion. A special anthem is said during the distribution. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> then invites all who have received Communion to give thanks, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> recites aloud a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of thanksgiving and one of petition. Mass is concluded with a blessing pronounced by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> over the people. The chief characteristic in this, as in the other <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, is the position of the general intercession or memento. It occurs, not after the <em>epiclesis</em> as in the Syrian <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, but immediately before it. It seems to be a continuation of the <em>anamnesis</em>. Of minor differences, it might be noted that the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> use one large veil to cover <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> and <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>; they use <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> at the preface; and they have two fractions of the Host, one symbolical recalling the passion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the other <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the distribution of Communion.
