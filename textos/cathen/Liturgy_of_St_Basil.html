<h1>Liturgy of St. Basil</h1>  

<p>Several Oriental <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, or at least several <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">anaphoras</a>, have been attributed to the great <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia from 370 to 379. That St. Basil composed a liturgy, or rather reformed an existing liturgy, is beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, since besides the constant tradition of the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a> there are many testimonies in ancient writings to establish the fact. In a treatise on the tradition of the Divine liturgy attributed to <a href="../cathen/12449b.htm">St. Proclus</a>, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople (434-466), it is stated that when St. Basil noticed the <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothfulness</a> and degeneracy of men, how they were wearied by the length of the liturgy, he shortened it in order to cure their <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">sloth</a> (P.G., LXV, 849). More certain testimony to the existence of a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> text which went under the name of St. Basil is given in a letter of <a href="../cathen/11783c.htm">Peter the Deacon</a>, one of the Scythian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to settle certain dogmatic questions. Writing about the year 520 to the African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in exile in <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, Peter, an Oriental, mentions a Liturgy of St. Basil, which was known and used throughout the entire East, and even quotes a passage from it: "Hence, also, Blessed Basil, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of C&aelig;saria, in a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the holy altar, with which almost the entire East is familiar, says among other things: Grant us, O Lord, Thy strength and protection; make the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> good and preserve the just in their righteousness. For Thou canst do all things and there is no one who may oppose Thee; for when Thou desirest, Thou savest, and no one resists Thy will." (P.L., LXV, 449.)

<p>Leontius of Byzantium, writing about the middle of the sixth century, censures <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> because he was not content with the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> handed down by the Fathers to the churches, but composed a Mass of his own, showing, thereby, no reverence either for that of the Apostles, or for that composed in the same spirit by the great St. Basil (P.G., LXXXVI, 1368). The <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Quinisext, or Trullan Council</a> (692), in its thirty-second canon draws an argument from the written liturgy of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the church of the C&aelig;sareans, St. Basil, whose glory has spread through the whole world (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Coll. Conc., XI, 958). Finally, in the Barberini <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> there is a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the latter part of the eighth, or the early part of the ninth, century which contains a Greek liturgy entitled the "Liturgy of St. Basil".

<p>It is not known precisely just what the nature of the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> reform was, nor what liturgy served as the basis of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> work. Very probably he shortened and changed somewhat the liturgy of his own diocese, which was akin to the Liturgy of St. James. In later times it underwent some development, so that with our present <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of its history it would be almost impossible to reconstruct it as it came from the pen of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of C&aelig;sarea. According to the tradition of the Greek <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, their liturgy is practically the work of St. Basil, due allowance being made for changes and amelioration in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. This is older than either of the other two Byzantine <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, and is mentioned under the name of St. Basil in ancient times as if it were then the normal liturgy. Of the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">anaphoras</a> attributed to St. Basil the Syriac and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> are probably derived from the Byzantine Greek with some modifications. The <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> is a translation of the Coptic, while the Coptic, Arabic, and Greek <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> are substantially the same. These <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">anaphoras</a> of St. Basil are different from the C&aelig;sarean or Byzantine liturgy, and do not possess all the characteristics of the Alexandrian Rite, but appear rather to be modelled on the Syrian type, so they are probably an importation into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. The Greek <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> contains several <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> (identical with those in the Byzantine liturgy) expressly ascribed to St. Basil, and from these it may derive its title.

<p>The C&aelig;sarean or Byzantine Liturgy is used in the countries which were evangelized from Constantinople, or which came under its influence for any considerable period. It is used, for example, by the Orthodox and <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> Greek churches in the Orient, as well as by the Greek communities in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. Translated into the Old Slavonic it is used by Orthodox and <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and in some parts of the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian Empire</a>; translated into Georgian and Rumanian it is used respectively in <a href="../cathen/06460a.htm">Georgia</a> and Rumania. It has also been translated into several other languages and dialects for use in the Russian dependencies and where the Russian Church has missions, as well as into Arabic for use in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Since the Liturgy of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> has become the normal liturgy of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, that of St. Basil is now used only on the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> with the exception of <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>, on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a> and <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>, on the vigils of <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> and of the Epiphany, and on the feast of St. Basil, which in the Greek calendar occurs on the first day of January.

<p>The liturgy may be divided into the Mass of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> and the Mass of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. The first contains the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the prothesis, of the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, of the little entrance, and of the trisagion, the lessons, and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the ectenes and of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>. The Mass of the faithful begins with the two <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and contains the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the great entrance, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>, which is expressly ascribed to St. Basil, the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a>, the Creed, and the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> proper, starting with the Eucharistic Preface followed by the Sanctus, embraces the preparatory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the Consecration, the Consecration itself, the <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiclesis</a> or invocation of the Holy Ghost, the Great Intercession for the living and the dead, the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a>, the inclination, <a href="../cathen/05380b.htm">Elevation</a>, Communion, thanksgiving, and dismissal.
