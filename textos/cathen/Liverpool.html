<h2>History since 1840</h2>

<p>From 1688 to 1840 Lancashire was subject to the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Northern District of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In 1840 the Northern District was divided into three districts: the Northern District (Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Durham, now the <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle</a>), the Yorkshire District, now the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/10286a.htm">Middlesbrough</a> and Leeds, and the Lancashire District containing with all Lancaster, the Isle of Man, and Cheshire. The first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the new Lancashire District was Bishop George Hilary Brown (b. 13 Jan., 1786), who after being for twenty-one years <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Peter's, Lancaster, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 24 August, 1840, at Liverpool, by Bishop John Briggs, with the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bugia <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus</a></em>, which in 1842 was changed to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tloa <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus</a></em>. In 1843 Dr. James Sharples was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> coadjutor, but died in August, 1850. The following month the Lancashire District was broken into three parts, Cheshire became part of <a href="../cathen/13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a> Diocese, South-eastern Lancashire became the Salford Diocese, and the rest of Lancashire with the Isle of Man became the Liverpool Diocese, of which Bishop Brown remained <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In 1853 be obtained another coadjutor, <a href="../cathen/06663a.htm">Canon Alexander Goss</a>, of St. Edward's College (b. 5 July, 1814, at Ormskirk), who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Gerra. Bishop Brown died, 25 January, 1856, and was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/06663a.htm">Bishop Goss</a>, who ruled as ordinary for seventeen years and died, 3 October, 1872. After an interval of five months Canon Bernard O'Reilly (b. 10 January, 1824, at Ballybeg, County Meath, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>), was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a> 19 March, 1873. During his long <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a> of twenty-one years he opened some twenty-two churches in Liverpool city and the immediate neighbourhood, but his special work was the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St. Joseph at Upholland, of which the foundation stone was laid on the feast of the Patronage of St. Joseph, 18 April, 1880, the college being ready to receive the students on 22 September, 1883. Two years later, on Trinity eve, 30 May, 1885, the first body of students were raised to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> within its walls. Its second <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, Mgr John Bilsborrow, was taken from it in 1892 to become <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13399a.htm">Salford</a>. Bishop O'Reilly died on 9 April, 1894, and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>.

<p>Canon Thomas Whiteside (b. at Lancaster on 17 April, 1857; <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 30 May, 1885), who was the third president of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, was, at the age of thirty-seven years, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Liverpool by <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a>. The increase in the number of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> since his accession has made possible more thorough pastoral work. During the years 1890 to 1905, the number approaching <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Communion increased from 146,000 to 186,000; those attending Sunday <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> from 138,000 to 180,000, some 16,000 non-Catholics were received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whilst about two million communions are received in the course of the year by about 250,000, who have made their first <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">communion</a>. A very large proportion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, especially in the towns, are of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> birth or descent, though in the country parts and in North Lancashire many old Lancashire <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> remain which during the ages that have elapsed from the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> have never lost the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>Originally Lancashire belonged to the Kingdom of Northumbria and the Diocese of York, but in 642 Southern Lancashire became part of Mercia and of the <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Diocese of Lichfield</a>. <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>, in 1542, made <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>, including South Lancashire, into a separate diocese. In Queen Elizabeth's time it is the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a> who complains that there is a confederacy of Lancashire Papists, and that "from Warrington all along the sea-coast of Lancashire, the gentlemen were of that faction and withdraw themselves from religion" (i.e., from attending the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> service). For this crime fifty Lancashire <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> gentlemen were arrested in one night, and in 1587 six hundred <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">recusants</a> were prosecuted. A yearly fine of &#163;260 was the penalty paid in some cases for twenty years for refusing to attend the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> service, and after death refusal of <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">Christian burial</a>. At Rossall, in North Lancashire, was born <a href="../cathen/01322b.htm">Cardinal Allen</a>, the founder of the Seminary of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, which in five years sent a hundred <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to face the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> death in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Amongst the Lancashire <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were the <a href="../cathen/07159a.htm">Ven. George Haydock</a>, b. 1556 at Cottam Hall, Preston, and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in 1589 at the age of 28 at Tyborne; <a href="../cathen/14711a.htm">Ven. John Thulis</a>, b. at Upholland, near Wigan, and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at Lancaster in 1616, <a href="../cathen/05293b.htm">Ven. Edmund Arrowsmith</a>, b. at Haydock, near St. Helens in 1585, and in 1628, at the age of 43, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at Lancaster. His "holy hand" is still devoutly kept in the church of Ashton-in-Makerfield.

<p>In addition to the manliness of the Lancashire character and the example of sacrifice given by the Lancashire gentry, the Gerards, Blundells, Molyneuxes, Andertons, Cliftons, Scarisbricks, Gillows, the close connexion which Lancashire has always had with <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> has done much for this preservation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Traces of this connexion are seen in the old St. Patrick's Cross of Liverpool which was supposed to mark the spot where <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> preached before sailing to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and in the pre-Reformation <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> still preserved at Fernyhalgh, near Preston, which bears the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 1529 and an inscription testifying that it was given by "Dosius Maguire, Chieftain of Fermanagh". Again the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> famine of 1847 filled the Lancashire towns with <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> exiles so that hardly one can be found without its church of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> to mark their devotion to him who brought them their <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>.
