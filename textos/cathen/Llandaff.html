<h1>Llandaff</h1>  

<p>ANCIENT DIOCESE OF LLANDAFF (LANDAVENSIS)

<p>The origins of this see are to be found in the sixth century monastic movement initiated by St. Dubricius, who presided over the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Mochros. The saint made his disciple, <a href="../cathen/14473b.htm">St. Teilo</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the daughter <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Llandaff, which after the retirement of Dubricius to Bardsey came to be the chief <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Llandaff were in episcopal orders and SS. Teilo and Dubricius are referred to as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. The territory in which Llandaff was situated belonged to the kings or chiefs of Morganwg or Owent, who presented gifts of lands to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Llandaff. The early title <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">"archbishop"</a> implied only rule over other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and as the episcopate became <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> it gave way to the usual style of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The successors of <a href="../cathen/14473b.htm">St. Teilo</a> long maintained absolute independence within their own territories, and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Llandaff were extensive. The early history of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, the chief authority for which is the "Book of Llandaff" (<em>Llyfr Teilo</em>, Teilo's book), is very obscure, and the order of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> uncertain. When St. Augustine began the conversion of the Saxons in 597 he invited the British <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to co-operate, but they refused and there was no communication between the Celtic <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the Roman missionaries. Unfortunately this resulted in long enmity between the Churches in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> and in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. It was not till 768 that the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> adopted the Roman use of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. From this time <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and kings went on frequent <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and relations with the Saxon episcopate became more friendly. After the Conquest the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> exercised their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> placed Bishop Herwald of Llandaff under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>. Herwald's successor Urban was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, after taking an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of canonical obedience to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, and from that time Llandaff became a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. A standing difficulty was the admixture of race and language due to the English settlements, also to the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and incontinence of the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who had ceased to observe <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> and gave <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> to the Normans and English. A reform was gradually effected, chiefly by the establishment of new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> had houses at Chepstow, Abergavenny, Goldeliff, Bassaleg, Usk, Llangyran, Ewenny, and Cardiff; the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, at Neath, <a href="../cathen/14736d.htm">Tintern</a>, Margam, Grace Dieu, Caerleon, and Llantarnam; Cluniacs at Malpas; <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a> at St. Kynemark; <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> were settled in Cardiff.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, begun in 1120, was enlarged at the close of the twelfth century. It was regarded as a fine specimen of Early English architecture, but after the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was allowed to fall into a ruinous state, from which it was restored during the nineteenth century. In the following list of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Llandaff, the order and dates of all before the tenth century are unknown. St. Dubricius (Dyfrig) is sometimes given as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but more correctly the episcopal succession begins with <a href="../cathen/14473b.htm">St. Teilo</a>, who was succeeded by Oudoceus. After him came Ubilwynus, Aidanus, Elgistil, Lunapeius, Comegern, Argwistil, Gurvan, Guodloin, Edilbinus, Grecielus, all of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> authenticity. More historical are Berthguin, Trychan, Elvog, Catguaret, Edilbiu, Grecielis, Cerenhir, Nobis, and Nud. Cimeilljauc, Libiau, Marebluid, Pater, Gulfrit, Gucaun (<a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 982), Bledri (983), Joseph (1022), Herwald (1056), Urban (Worgan) (1107), vacancy (1134), Uchtryd (1140), Nicholas ap Gwrgant (1148), vacancy (1183), William Saltmarsh (1186), Henry of Abergavenny (1193), William of Goldehif (1219), Elias de Radnor (1230), vacancy (1240), William de Burgh (1245), John de la Ware (1254), William de Radnor (1257), William de Braose (1266), vacancy (1287), John of Monmouth (1296), John de Egleselif (1323), John Pascal (1347), Roger Cradock (1361), Thomas Ruchook (1383), William Bottlesham (1386), Edmund Broinfield (1389), Tide-man de Winchcomb (1393), Andrew Barrett (1395), John Burghill (1396), Thomas Peverell (1398), John de Ia Zouche (1408), John Wells (1425), Nicholas Ashby (1441), John Hunden (1458), John Smith (1476), John Marshall (1478), John Ingleby (1496), Miles Salley (1500), George de Athequa (1517), Robert Holgate (1537), Anthony Kitchin (1545), who alone of the English episcopate fell into <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> under Elizabeth and died in 1563. The ancient diocese comprised the Counties of Glamorgan and Monmouth except a few <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in each. It contained but one archdeaconry (Liandaff). The dedication of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was to SS. Peter, Andrew, Dubricius, Teilo, and Oudoceus, and the arms of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were sable, two crosiers in saltire, or and argent, in a chief azure three mitres with labels of the second.
