<h1>Llanthony Priory</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a>, situated amongst the Black Mountains of South <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, nine miles north-east of Abergavenny. St. David is said to have lived some time here as a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, but the tradition lacks confirmation. The origin of the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> was as follows. About the year 1100 a retainer of the Baron of Herefordshire, named William, whilst hunting in the neighbourhood, discovered the ruins of a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and cell, supposed to have been once occupied by St. David, and he thereupon decided to quit the world and become a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> there himself. He was afterwards joined by Ernisius, <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Queen Maud, wife of Henry I. The fame of the two <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a> reached the ears of William's former lord, Hugh de Lacy, who in 1107 founded and endowed a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for them, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>. The rule of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a> was adopted. In course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the severity of the climate, the poverty of the soil and the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> natives combined to make life there impossible. In 1134 the entire community, numbering about forty, abandoned the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and took refuge in the palace of Robert, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>. After two years a new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was built for them near Gloucester by Milo, Earl of <a href="../cathen/07255a.htm">Hereford</a>, which was called Llanthony Secunda. Only a few canons lived from time to time in the original <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and both houses were governed by one prior, who resided at Gloucester.

<p>The buildings at Llanthony fell gradually into decay and passed into private hands at the dissolution in 1539. In 1807 the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was bought by Walter Savage Landor. It still belongs to his descendents, the habitable portion of it having been added to and converted into an inn. The church is in ruins, but the western towers, part of the central one, and some of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> piers and arches are standing.
