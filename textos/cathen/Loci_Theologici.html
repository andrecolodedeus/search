<h1>Loci Theologici</h1>  

<p><em>Loci theologici</em> or <em>loci communes</em>, are the common topics of discussion in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. As <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> is the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> which places in the light of reason the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> revealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, its topics are, strictly speaking, coextensive with the whole content of revelation. Usage, however, and circumstance have restricted the <em>loci</em> to narrower but ill-defined limits. <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, published in 1521 "Hypotyposes theologic&aelig; seu loci communes", a presentation of the chief <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrines</a> drawn from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> as the only <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>. His avowed intention was to improve on similar works by <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">John Damascene</a> and <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>. Leaving aside undisputed <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> which do not bear directly on the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of man, he expounds with scanty commentary, or none at all, the state of fallen man, <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of man, the Gospel, the power of the Law and the power of the Gospel, grace, justification, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and charity, the difference between the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, the abolition of the Law through the Gospel, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of Baptism, Penance, and the Eucharist, authority, and <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon's</a> "Loci" became the textbook for <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and the author has rightly been styled the <em>pr&oelig;ceptor Germani&oelig;</em>. Like <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, he had his imitators and commentators, who formed a goodly body of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a>. The greatest work of this kind is "Loci communes theologici", by <a href="../cathen/06466c.htm">John Gerard</a>, professor at Jena, published in nine volumes (1610-1622); it is the greatest and also the last. After Gerard the loci <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> gives place to systematic <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>; the unconnected exposition of "topics" in the light of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> gradually disappears. On the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon's</a>" Loci" were countered by the "Enchiridion locorum communium" of <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Johann Eck</a>, which between 1525 and 1576 ran through forty-five editions. It was dedicated to <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII of England</a>. The topics which <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Eck</a> expounds and defends against the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> are: the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and her authority, the councils, the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and works, confirmation, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, confession, communion under both kinds, matrimony, extreme unction, human <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> feasts, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, the worship of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and their images, the Mass, <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">clerical celibacy</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a> and temporalities of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, annates, the burning of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, discussion with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers followed on the track of the Ingolstadt professor; e.g. Franciscus Orantes (died 1584), Konrad Kling (died 1566), Joseph V. Zambaldi (died 1722), and Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> (q.v.), whose "Disputationes de controversiis fidei" (1581-92) are still the chief arsenal and stronghold of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> controversy. But, whilst <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> concentrated their best <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> effort on the <em>loci</em>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> soon returned to the systematic methods of the older <em>Summ&oelig;</em>.

<p>Cano (died 1560) applied the term <em>loci theologici</em> to a treatise on the fundamental principles or sources of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological science</a>. On the threshold of every <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> there stands a complex of preliminary principles, postulates, and questions, which must be elucidated before progress is possible. Some are common to all <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, some are peculiar to each. Before Cano the questions preliminary to <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> had never been treated as a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> apart, general dialectics being deemed a sufficient introduction. Cano observes that the "Queen of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>" draws its arguments and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> chiefly from authority, and only calls in reason as the handmaid of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Accordingly he sets up ten <em>loci</em> &mdash; sources of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> &mdash; without, however, pretending to limit them to that number. They are: the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Catholic tradition</a>, of <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, of the Fathers, of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a>; natural reason, the authority of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> in <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, and the authority of history. The first seven are the proper places in which <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> moves, the last three are useful auxiliaries. Melchior Cano's work gave a new turn to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> teaching. Much that before his time had been taken for granted, or, at best, only loosely investigated, became the favourite theme of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The foundations of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, which had lain embedded in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mind, were laid bare, examined, strengthened, and rendered safe both for the believer inside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and against the foe without. The scientific method which takes nothing for granted, but investigates and probes to the very root every item of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, is not a thing of yesterday, much less a child of anti-Catholic tendencies: Bishop Melchior Cano introduced it as the best weapon of offence and defence in religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a>. The "Loci theologici" was first published in 1563, three years after the author's death, by the Grand Inquisitor Valdes. Twenty-six editions followed the first: eight in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, nine in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, seven in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and two in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Numerous writers during the following centuries produced works on the same lines: Seraphimus Ractius (Razzi) (died 1613), Petrus de Lorca (died 1606), Dominicus a S. Trinitate (died 1687), Ch. du Plessis d'Argentr&eacute;e (died 1740), Franciscus Kranz, and many more. Gradually the subject-matter of the <em>loci</em> entered the body of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> under the title of "Prolegomena", general dogmatics, fundamental <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, or <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a>. In "A Manual of Catholic Theology", by Wilhelm and Scannell (London, 1906), the loci are treated in the first book under the following headings: the sources of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>; transmission of revelation; the Apostolic deposit of revelation; <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> traditions; the <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>; <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and understanding.

<p>The necessity of meeting attacks on the Faith at the precise point on which they are directed has, of recent years, led to a modification in apologetic methods. Existing textbooks draw their <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from Scripture, tradition and, when possible, from reason. The authority of these loci, or sources, having been previously <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, the demonstration is considered complete. But since evolutionism has taken hold of the modern mind and filled it with a never-satisfied desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the origin and the growth of all things in the realms of nature and of mind, the loci themselves have been submitted to fierce criticism by men who will be convinced by nothing but facts and experiments. They proceed by the positive, or historical, method which eliminates all <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> factors, and retains only the bare facts linked together in an unbroken chain of causes and effects. The Bible to them is no longer the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but a mere collection of documents of various merit; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is an institution of human origin. It must be confessed that the historical method is fraught with danger even to those who use it in defence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The danger is real but so is the necessity of facing it, for it is useless to argue from authority with men who acknowledge no authority. What is wanted is that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> keep a steady eye on the landmarks fixed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and deviate neither to the right nor to the left. With that precaution, the historical method is likely to become an abundant source of light and understanding on points of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and discipline hitherto viewed out of their historical frame and in a borrowed light. Thus the discovery of the <a href="../cathen/04779a.htm">Didache</a> has been a revelation which has upset many fond calculations, and the excavations in Palestine, <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and other places, where they bear on Bible history, have done more good than harm to the traditional views. The French are at the present day the pioneers of the historical treatment of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>; one need only point to the splendid series of "Studies in the History of Dogmas" published by Lecoffre in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.
