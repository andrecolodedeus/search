<h1>Lodovico Mazzolini</h1>  

<p>(Also known as MAZZOLINI DA FERRARA, LODOVICO FERRARESA, and IL FERRARESE)

<p><a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, b. in <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> in 1480, d., according to one account, in 1528, and to another, in 1530; place of death unknown. This artist is generally represented as having been a pupil of <a href="../cathen/04417b.htm">Lorenzo Costa</a>, and has having come under the influence of Ercole Roberti, but should be more correctly described as a pupil of Panetti. Morelli called him "the Glow-worm", <em>"der Gl&uuml;hwurm"</em>, from his brilliant gem-like colour and luminous sparkling quality, and he <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that Mazzolini was a pupil of Panetti rather than <a href="../cathen/04417b.htm">Costa</a>, by the form of the ear and hand in his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>, by his landscape backgrounds with deep conical blue mountains and streaks of dazzling white, and by his scheme of colour. Comparing <a href="../cathen/04417b.htm">Lorenzo Costa</a> with <a href="../cathen/11737b.htm">Perugino</a>, Morelli compares Panetti with Pintorrichio, although he says as an artist the Perugian far surpassed the somewhat dry and narrow-minded artist of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, but it is perfectly clear that it was to this dry and so-called narrow-minded man that Mazzolini owed his excellent work. The <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> backgrounds of his pictures are their specially distinctive feature, and notably the creamy-toned marble. Attention should further be directed to his use of gold in the high lights of his draperies.

<p>Of his personal history we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing, save that he worked both in <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> and Bologna, and that he married in 1521 Giovanna, the daughter of Bartolomeo Vacchi, a <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>. His most notable picture represents Christ disputing with the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1524, and to be seen at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>. It is in his pictures with small figures that he displays the power of imparting pleasure, as his gift was rather in the direction of <em>genre</em> than of historical <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, and to most observers there is something curiously <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> about his work. There is a second important picture of his in <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, a Virgin and Child, two at the Louvre, one in <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, three in the National Gallery, and three in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, other examples in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and in various private collections. The chief work of his in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> is one belonging to Lord Wimborne. He is also represented in the galleries of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, St. Petersburg, <a href="../cathen/07108a.htm">The Hague</a>, and in the Capitol of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the Doria, and the Borghese.
