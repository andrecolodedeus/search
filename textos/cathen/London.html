<h1>London</h1>  

<p>London, the capital of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and chief city of the British Empire, is situated about fifty miles from the mouth of the Thames, Lat. 51&#176;30', Long. 0&#176;5'. The word <em>London</em> is used in widely different senses for administrative purposes:--

<ul> <li>The City of London, with a population of 26,923, occupying an area of 668 statute acres, little more than one square mile. <li>London, as defined by the Metropolis Local Management Act, now the County of London, with a population (last census 1901) of 4,536,541 and an area of 75,462 statute acres, or about 117 square miles. London district as referred to in the Registrar-General's Tables of Mortality coincides very nearly with this. <li>London, in reference to the Parliamentary Boroughs, has a population of about 4-1/2 millions and an area of about 80,126 statute acres, or 125 square miles. <li>London, as the Metropolitan Police District, together with the City has a population of 6,581,372 and an area of nearly 700 square miles. It extends over a radius of 15 miles from Charing Cross. <li>London, as an <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> diocese, comprises Middlesex, Essex, and part of Hertfordshire.</ul>

<p>London will here be treated under the following heads: I. General History. II. Ancient Catholic Diocese. III. London Catholics after the Reformation. IV. Modern Civil Administration.
<h2 id="section1">General history</h2>
<h3>Pre-Norman times</h3>

<p>The origins both of the name and the very existence of the "great burh, Lundunaborg, which is the greatest and most famous of all burhs in the northern lands" (Ragnar Lodbrog Saga) lie hidden in antiquity. Both name and town alike are popularly accounted for in the wonderful legend of <a href="../cathen/06428a.htm">Geoffrey of Monmouth</a> which found wide credence in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. According to this, Brutus, a descendant of Aeneas who was the son of Venus, founded this city after the fall of Troy, eleven hundred years before Christ came, and called it Troynovant, or New Troy. And after a thousand years there reigned King Lud who built walls and towers to his city, and whose name yet lives in Ludgate; so that the town was called C&acirc;er Lud. Thus Lud's-Town became London. But in the light of topography this legendary explanation must give way to the natural derivation from <em>Llyn-din</em>, the Lake-fort. For the nucleus of London, the ground which the city proper still occupies, was composed of two hills rising with steep sloping sides from the north bank of the Thames, separated from each other by the stream known later as Walbrook, and shut in on the north by the great moor and fen the memory of which survives in the names Moorfields and Finsbury.

<p>The river Fleet bounded the western hill on its western side, and all around lay the marshes through which the Thames flowed, not shut in by embankments, but at high water flooding all the low lying land and making it one vast lake. From this lake rose a few islets known still to us by place-names in "ey" or "ea" such as Bermondsey, Thorney, Battersea, and Chelsea. The western island, that between the rivers Walbrook and Fleet with the eminence now <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> by St. Paul's <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, was the site of a British settlement which existed before the coming of the Romans. The discovery of prehistoric remains and some inscribed <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of Cymbeline have established the fact of this pre-Roman city against the theories of J. R. Green (Making of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>), Dr. Guest (Origines Celticae), and some others. It probably was a collection of round thatched cottages built of clay and branches and surrounded by an earthwork which enclosed about one hundred acres. In time the Thames brought the boats of traders and it became a place of primitive trade and commerce. This was probably its condition when the Romans arrived in A.D. 43. Unless it had already been established as a known mart it is difficult to believe that by the year A.D. 61 when it finds its first mention in history in the "Annals" of Tacitus it could be described as "Londinium, not dignified with the name of a colony but celebrated for the gathering of dealers and commodities". (Annals, A.D. 61.)

<p>The Roman settlement seems to have been first made on the eastern hill, to the east of Walbrook. Here they built their fortress, a walled enclosure such as that still surviving at Richborough. Under the protection of this the town grew in size and became a busy mercantile centre, with the villas of its wealthier citizens, traces of which are still discovered, lying round its citadel. For nearly four hundred years it formed the Roman city of <a href="../cathen/02078b.htm">Augusta</a>, though the old Celtic name still survived. During this period it was captured by Boadicea who massacred the inhabitants (A.D. 61), was restored by the Romans, was the scene of the successive usurpations of Carausius (286) and Allectus (293), and of the defeat in battle of the last named. During the latter part of the Roman occupation it was <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">Christianized</a>. The fact that all the churches in Thames Street, the oldest part of the city, were <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and not to later <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, suggests that they occupied the sites of early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> churches. In 314 Restitutus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of London, was present at the <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a>, and legend purports to have preserved the names of several of his predecessors and <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">successors</a> (<a href="../cathen/06428a.htm">Geoffrey of Monmouth</a>), a claim which the modern historian, Dr. Stubbs (Episcopal Succession), treats with respect.

<p>When the Saxons drove out the Romans and Britons during the fifth century, London was one of the few places which preserved a continuous existence. Probably it had fallen into the hands of the East Saxons before 571 (Lethaby, op. cit. inf., 29-31). In 604 <a href="../cathen/10168b.htm">St. Mellitus</a> was sent by St. Augustine to be the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of London of the restored <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, and with him begins the line of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> that lasted nearly a thousand years (see list of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> below). In the time of <a href="../cathen/10168b.htm">St. Mellitus</a> the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of St. Paul and the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a> were founded. But little is known of London during early <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxon</a> times. It suffered much from fires and much from the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danes</a>, being sacked by the latter in 839 and again in 895. Under Alfred however the Londoners defeated the Danes and enjoyed a period of prosperous tranquillity, so that by the time of Athelstan, his grandson, London required as many as eight moneyers, to produce the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a>. But in the eleventh century the Danes again harassed it and it suffered much in the struggle between Canute and Edmund Ironside, though it retained its <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, as during the reign of Canute one-seventh of his entire revenue came from London. From this time it disputed with <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> the priority among English cities. <a href="../cathen/05322a.htm">St. Edward the Confessor</a> during his reign (1042-1066) resided chiefly at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a> where he rebuilt <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster Abbey</a>, in which his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are still enshrined. In this minster the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of all English sovereigns takes place, and it is the national burying place for great <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, statesmen and warriors lying in the north <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>, "Poets' corner" occupying the south <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>, while nearly thirty kings and queens rest in the choir and side <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>.


<h3>London under the Normans</h3>

<p>After the Battle of Hastings the citizens of London, after an indecisive engagement with the troops of William the Conqueror in <a href="../cathen/14162b.htm">Southwark</a>, submitted to him at Berkhamstead (Herts), and he was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> in <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster Abbey</a>. In a charter of four and a half lines addressed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the portreeve, and the burgesses, he declared that: "I grant them all to be law-worthy as they were in the days of King Edward, and I grant that every child shall be his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> heir after his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> days and I will not suffer any man do you wrong." Not trusting the citizens, however, William built the White Tower, the keep of the Tower of London, to overawe them, and also Baynard's Castle at the western extremity of the city. London at this time consisted of a collection of low wooden houses thatched with reeds or straw, thus affording combustible material for the numerous and destructive fires which frequently broke out, as in 1087 when the greater part of the city, including St. Paul's, was burnt. Bishop Maurice immediately began a new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> which was one of the largest churches in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> being 600 feet long. It contained the shrine of <a href="../cathen/05517a.htm">St. Erconwald</a> to which great crowds of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> journeyed, reaching the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> by the thoroughfare still called Pilgrim Street.

<p>At this time a period of building activity set in during which London was enriched with many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> and public buildings erected in stone. William Rufus built Westminster Hall, the Tower ramparts and a new London Bridge to replace that which was washed away by the great floods in 1091. In 1100 the citizens obtained a new charter from Henry I, which was confirmed by Stephen in 1135. In Henry's reign many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> were built, including the Priory of <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">St. John of Jerusalem</a> at Clerkenwell, and the Priory of St. Bartholomew founded by Rahere in Smithfield, the noble church of which still survives. The <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Knights Templars</a> established themselves in Holborn in 1118, removing to Fleet Street later in the century, where the Temple church (<a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 1185) yet remains. Another great fire broke out in 1136, destroying the city from Ludgate, then the west end of the town, to St. Paul's. The Civil War between Stephen and Matilda with which the Norman period was brought to a close marked the epoch at which London rose to the position of a capital. For unlike Winchester it did not suffer in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and when Matilda deprived it of its charters the citizens rose and drove her from their city.
<h3>London under the Plantagenets</h3>

<p>Under Henry II, who viewed the Londoners with disfavour owing to their repulse of his mother, we have our first contemporary account of London, the vivid description of Fitzstephen, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and friend and biographer of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. He tells us of a city walled round with the White Tower on the east and Montfichet and Baynard's Castle on the west where Blackfriars now is. There are seven double gates, Aldgate, Bishopsgate, Cripplegate, Aldersgate, Newgate, Ludgate, and the Bridge. Two miles up the river lay the Royal Palace and Abbey of Westminster connected with the city by the riverside thoroughfare called the Strand. He describes the wealth and power of the citizens, and grows enthusiastic over the plenty in the markets, the Chepe &#151; now Cheapside &#151; Eastcheap, Billingsgate, and Dowgate. The various trades were assigned their own localities as the ancient surviving names tell us, &#151; Milk Street, Bread Street, Wood Street, Fish Street, Poultry Street, and others. Friday Street was the market for Friday fare &#151; dried fish. In the Chepe were the mercers, goldsmiths, armourers, glovers, and many others. He lingers with delight on the sports of the young citizens, hunting in Middlesex Forest, wrestling, leaping, and playing at ball; and in winter skating and sliding on frozen Moorfields. He describes the beautiful garden and houses occupied by the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and barons when they were summoned to great councils by the king. Above all he bears witness to the orderly government and careful social observance practiced. "I do not think that there is any city with more commendable customs of church attendance, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> ordinances, keeping sacred festivals, <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>, hospitality, confirming, betrothals, contracting <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, celebration of nuptials, preparing feasts, cheering the guests, and also in care for funeral and the interment of the dead. The only pest of London are the immoderate drinking of fools and the frequency of fires" ("Descriptio nobilissimae civitatis Londiniae" in preface to "Vita St. Thomae").

<p>The city then contained thirteen larger conventual churches and one hundred and twenty-six <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches. In 1176 Peter of Colechurch, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, began the rebuilding of London Bridge with stone. It took thirty-three years to build and lasted for seven hundred years. At this time the city was governed by a portreeve, two sheriffs, and the aldermen of the various wards. In 1189 Henry Fitz-alwyne became the first Mayor of London under the title of "bailiff" and he held the office till 1212. During his tenure of office the citizens obtained from King John a charter empowering them to elect a lord mayor annually. They had previously obtained from <a href="../cathen/13041b.htm">Richard I</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over and conservancy of the Thames. In 1189 the court of aldermen decreed that in future houses should be built of stone instead of wood so as to check the disastrous fires, but wooden houses continued to be built, though by this time they were plastered and whitewashed. During the thirteenth century the conventual establishments were increased by the coming of the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, who unlike the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> and Augustinians, preferred to live in the midst of cities. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> established themselves in Holborn (1221), and in the district still bearing their popular name, Blackfriars (1276), on which occasion the city boundaries were enlarged so as to include their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> (Grey <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>) settled in Farringdon Without in 1224; the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> (White Friars) near Fleet Street (1241); the Austin <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> in Broad Street Ward (1253); the Crutched <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> (1298). The same period witnessed the rebuilding of <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster Abbey</a>, begun by Henry III in 1245 and finished in 1295, and of St. Paul's where a new Gothic choir was begun in 1240, and other additions including a tower were made till in 1315 the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was complete. Another noteworthy church of this period was St. Saviour's, Southwark (1250). In 1285 the citizens were deprived by Edward I of their right of electing the lord mayor and they did not regain it till 1297. In 1290 the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who since the time of William the Conqueror had lived in what is still called Old Jewry, were expelled from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.

<p>The fourteenth century was signalized by the great plague of 1349 which carried off one-half of the entire population of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Close to the spot where many of the victims were buried Sir Walter Manny built the Charterhouse in 1371. The remains of this <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> house are the only extensive monastic buildings of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> London which have survived the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> and the Great Fire. In 1381 the peace of London was disturbed by Wat Tyler's rebellion when much damage was done in the city till the citizens arrayed themselves in arms against the rebels and for the defence of the king. The close of the century witnessed the first mayoralty of Sir Richard Whittington, the popular hero of London and a munificent benefactor to the city. He filled the office three times (1397, 1406 and 1419) and built Newgate, Christ's Hospital and a considerable part of St. Bartholomew's <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> as well as the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at the Guildhall. Contemporary with him was one of London's greatest sons, <a href="../cathen/03642b.htm">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>, who died at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a> (1400). The fifteenth century witnessed little development in London. Repeated attacks of plague, especially that in 1407, checked the growth of the population. In 1411 the Guildhall was rebuilt, and during the century the walls and gates were strengthened. That this was a wise precaution in a disturbed age is shown by the failure of the attack on London during the Wars of the Roses when Thomas Neville assaulted each gate in succession and was repulsed at every one. In 1473 Caxton set up the first English printing press at <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, and was soon followed by Wynkyn de Worde, Pynson, and other great printers. The usurpation of Richard III and the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of Edward V and his brother in the Tower (1483) were the last events in the history of London under the Plantagenets.
<h3>London under the Tudors</h3>

<p>The opening of this period was marked by repeated outbreaks of the "sweating sickness" which was so common in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> that it was known as the <em>Sudor Anglicanus</em>. This first appeared in 1485 and broke out again in 1506, 1517, 1528, and 1551, carrying off thousands at each visitation; while in 1500 thirty thousand Londoners fell victims to the plague. Nevertheless the city continued to prosper under the firm Tudor rule, and frequent royal pageants were seen in its streets. Henry VII added to <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster Abbey</a> the finest building in the Perpendicular Style in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. His <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was begun in 1502 and finished in 1517. In 1512 the royal palace at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a> was burnt, and <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> was left without a London residence until in 1529 he took possession of <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Wolsey's</a> palace, York Place, and renamed it Whitehall. In 1530 he began to build St. James's Palace.

<p>And now a great change was in store for London, though it came about little by little. In 1534 Henry obtained the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> Act of Parliament abolishing the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and in the following year the Act of Supremacy gave him the title "Supreme Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>." London was reddened with the blood of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> of the London Charterhouse, <a href="../cathen/08462b.htm">Blessed John Fisher</a> and <a href="../cathen/14689c.htm">Blessed Thomas More</a> suffered in the summer of 1535. Others followed in succeeding years. In 1536 the smaller <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> were suppressed; in 1539 the greater <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> fell. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbeys of Westminster and Bermondsey; the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> of St. Mary Graces; the Augustinians of the Priories of St. Bartholomew, Smithfield, <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, Aldgate, and St. Mary Overy, Southwark; the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> at Clerkenwell, <a href="../cathen/07438a.htm">Holywell</a>, St. Helen's Bishopsgate, Kilburn, and Stratford, and all the houses of the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> were seized by the king and the religious were dispersed. On Henry's death (1547) things went from bad to worse. Protector Somerset and the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> party were in the ascendant, the substitution of English for Latin was ordered in all the churches, and crucifixes and images were pulled down. All <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> belonging to colleges and chantries were seized for royal uses, and even the great city guilds which held lands for the purposes of providing stipends for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, obits, and lights, had to redeem such lands at a total cost of 20,000 pounds, and to apply the rents arising therefrom to other charitable purposes.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life of London thus received blow after blow. There can be little <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> moreover that a considerable section of the populace was in sympathy with the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, a fact which was largely due to the frequent communication between London and the Continent. The brief <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> revival under Mary met with considerable opposition in London, and comparatively little had been done in the way of restoration when the accession of Elizabeth, in 1558, led to the complete overthrow of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. From the feast of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John Baptist</a> on 24 June, 1559 the Mass was forbidden and the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> ceased to be offered in London churches; St. Paul's <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> under the energetic influence of <a href="../cathen/02675a.htm">Bishop Bonner</a> being one of the last where Mass was said. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself and many of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and after the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of Elizabeth, in 1570, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> began again, reaching their height in point of numbers in 1588, the year of the <a href="../cathen/01727c.htm">Spanish Armada</a>. From this time forward London became a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> city and the history of the dwindling number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> will be described later.

<p>It is at this time that the first maps of London were produced. Anthony van den Wyngaerde produced his panorama between 1543 and 1550. Probably the first actual map is that of Hoefnagel, sometimes known as Braun and Hogenberg's map from the work in which it appeared. It is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1572. Others give priority to the undated map, attributed to Agas, which must have been made between 1570 and 1600. The city at this time was at the height of its prosperity. The brilliant Court of Elizabeth attracted men of action and men of letters, so that there never was a time when London held more distinguished Englishmen. Theatres now began to be built, though always outside the city boundaries: the "Theatre" and the "Curtain" at Shoreditch; the "Globe", "Rose" and "Hope" on the Bankside. There was also a theatre at Blackfriars. In 1566 the Royal Exchange was founded by Sir Thomas Gresham, receiving its name from Elizabeth in 1571. Attempts were now made to restrict the growth of London, but in vain, for its ever-increasing material prosperity made it a centre which drew men from all sides. Moorfields was drained and laid out as a pleasure-ground. The wealthier citizens began to build country houses, while courtiers built mansions in the neighbourhoods of Westminster, Whitehall, The Strand, and Lincoln's Inn Fields. This extension of the city led to the beginnings of a regular water-supply, the water being conveyed from the Thames in leaden pipes. The river itself was then the great highway of London, the streets being unmade and often foul and muddy. Drainage and refuse alike poured into the river and the question of a fresh water supply became an urgent one, especially in view of the rapid growth of London. To meet the want, Sir Hugh Myddleton devised and executed a wise scheme by which he provided London with a canal which brought water from Hertfordshire. This was completed in 1613. The population of London in the last years of Elizabeth was estimated at 145,000.
<h3>London under the Stuarts</h3>

<p>Between 1603 and 1714 a very great change came over London, for during this period the centre of social life slowly passed from the City to the west end of town, leaving the City as the centre of municipal and commercial life only. The suburbs grew until they became a vast town encircling this centre, and many times larger and more populous. Little by little the old walls were pulled down and many of the open spaces were covered with a network of streets many houses in which were now built of brick. Pavements for foot-passengers were also introduced. During the Civil War, London was the strength and mainstay of the Parliamentarians, and new fortifications consisting chiefly of earthworks were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. The execution of Charles I, which took place at the banqueting hall of the royal palace of Whitehall, in presence of vast crowds of Londoners, was a memorable event in London history. It was followed by the Commonwealth, during which <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were allowed by Cromwell to return to London, and in 1660 by the Restoration when the separation between the fashionable court life of the West End and the commercial life of the City was completed. In 1664 London was stricken by the Great Plague, last and worst of the pestilences, which raged with increasing <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> throughout the following year. The number of victims is not known for <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>. Nearly 70,000 deaths from plague were actually registered, but in this time of horror the registers could not be efficiently kept, and it is probable that at least 100,000 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> perished. A year after the plague had ceased, in 1666, the Great Fire occurred when for three days the whole city was in flames. It is not easy to overestimate the damage caused by this conflagration in which almost all the remains of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> London were destroyed. The great Gothic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and eighty-six of the old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches perished, together with the palaces and mansions of the City and the dwellings of the citizens. One good result ensued: the seeds of the plague were destroyed and the old insanitary streets were no more. In rebuilding the City a great opportunity was lost. For Wren's noble plan was not adopted and the old lines of streets were adhered to, though the new houses were all of brick. Owing to this decision, many of the ancient topographical and historical associations have been preserved, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but at the cost of both appearance and convenience.

<p>In 1675 Wren began the rebuilding of St. Paul's which was not finally completed till 1711. Built in the classical style its beauty lies in its proportions and in the noble and massive simplicity of the great <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> which lifts the cross 404 feet above the pavements of London. In it lie buried Nelson, <a href="../cathen/15580a.htm">Wellington</a>, and others chiefly of military and naval renown, though many famous <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> and musicians are also <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> there. Besides this masterpiece Wren designed thirty-five of the new City churches all distinguished by their fine steeples or towers and the harmonious proportions of their interiors, enriched as they are also by the noble carving of Grinling Gibbons. In 1671 the Monument was erected to commemorate the fire; it is a noble column 202 feet high, originally disfigured by an inscription explaining that the fire was "begun and carried on by the treachery and malice" of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> which was deservedly pilloried in Pope's lines:--

<blockquote><p>"Where London's column, pointing to the skies, <br>Like a tall bully lifts its head, and lies." </p></blockquote>

<p>The offensive inscription was removed during the reign of James II, but having been replaced after the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">Revolution</a> was finally obliterated in 1831, consequent on the passing of the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829. By the time of the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">Revolution</a> London was acknowledged as the greatest capital in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and boasted half a million inhabitants. In 1694 the Bank of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was founded, and in 1698 the old palace of Whitehall was burnt down. The rebuilding of London was still proceeding when the century drew to a close.
<h3>London in the eighteenth century</h3>

<p>London under the <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanoverian</a> kings lost the beauty it formerly had and became a vast collection of houses, plain but comfortable, a condition from which it is only now successfully emerging. There was a great extension of building in the West end and in the neighbourhoods of Bloomsbury, Marylebone, and May Fair, but unfortunately the architecture of the period was heavy and tasteless. At this time many <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> were founded or rebuilt to meet the wants of the increasing numbers of the poor. Among these were Westminster Hospital (founded 1719), Guy's (1725), St. Bartholomew's (rebuilt 1730-1733), St. Thomas's (1732), the London Hospital (instituted 1741), and the Middlesex Hospital (1745). Besides these, that noble charity the Foundling Hospital was instituted in 1738 and was moved to the present building in 1754.

<p>Till this time London had only one bridge, but in 1738 Westminster Bridge was begun and in 1750 it was opened. Blackfriars Bridge followed in 1769. In 1758 the houses on London Bridge had been demolished and shortly after, five of the old city Gates, Moorgate, Aldersgate, Aldgate, Cripplegate, and Ludgate, were pulled down. The Westminster Paving Act, passed in 1762, introduced many improvements in the thoroughfares; pavements were laid, and obstructions removed from the streets. About this time people commenced to place their names on their doors and the system of numbering houses began. There was, however, indescribable squalor and filth in many parts of the town, as may be seen in the pictures of Hogarth, and the moral corruption of the people was indescribable. The term "Rookery" was by no means unapt. The city had many troubles to encounter during the latter part of the century, such as the Silk-weavers riots (1765); the quarrel with the Court and Parliament about the election of John Wilkes (1768), and the terrible <a href="../cathen/06649c.htm">Gordon Riots</a> (1780) which were the outcome of the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Relief Act (1778). During the same period newspapers began to appear, several of which still exist: the "Morning Post" (1772), "Times" (1788), "Observer" (1791), "Morning Advertiser" (1794), and "Globe" (1803). This century also witnessed the rise of the British Museum (1753), the Royal Academy (1768), and the Royal Institution (1799).
<h3>London in the nineteenth century</h3>

<p>In 1801 the first census was taken and showed that the total population of London was 900,000 and of the city, 78,000. As the population in 1901 was returned as 4-1/2 millions it will be seen how rapid has been the growth of London during the past hundred years. Another fact illustrating this is that during the period 1879-1909 more than 1500 miles of new streets were built. It is clearly impossible within these limits to give any but the most salient facts. In 1801 the first attempts at steam navigation were made on the Thames. The London docks were begun four years later. They cover an area of 120 acres and cost four million pounds. In 1806 three great funerals took place in London, Nelson being buried in St. Paul's, Pitt and Fox in the Abbey. In 1807 gas was first used to light the public streets, and five years later a charter was granted to the Gas Light and Coke Company, the oldest of the lighting companies. Once more there was activity in bridge building; Old Vauxhall Bridge was opened in 1811, Waterloo Bridge in 1817, Southwark Bridge in 1819, and new London Bridge, a little farther west than its predecessor, was begun in 1825 and finished in 1831. The bridges at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a> and Blackfriars have since been rebuilt, and the magnificent Tower Bridge was opened in 1894, so that the seven chief London bridges are of nineteenth-century construction. Among the new buildings of this period were the Mint (1811), Regent Street (1813), the British Museum (1823), General Post Office (1824), while others were necessitated by the fires which destroyed the Old Houses of Parliament in 1834 and the Royal Exchange in 1838. The new Houses of Parliament, designed by Barry with much assistance from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> architect <a href="../cathen/12558b.htm">Pugin</a>, were begun in 1840, the House of Lords being opened in 1847, the House of Commons in 1852.

<p>In the great revolutionary year of 1848 London was threatened by the Chartists, and extensive preparations were made for defence, but the movement came to nothing. Two great international exhibitions took place in the years 1851 and 1862 with useful results to the commerce of the capital. This was further helped by the development of the railways, which brought about further alterations in London and necessitated the erection of the great terminal railway stations: Euston, L.&amp; N.W.R.; King's Cross, G.N.R.; St. Pancras, M.R.; Paddington, G.W.R.; Marylebone, G.C.R.; Waterloo, L. and S.W.R.; Liverpool St., G.E.R.; Holborn, S.E. and C.R.; Cannon St., S.E. and C.R.; Charing Cross, S.E. and C.R.; Victoria, S.E. and C.R., and L.B. and S.C.R.; London Bridge, L.B. and S.C.R.; Fenchurch St., London, Tilbury and Southend Railway. One of the immediate results of the facilities offered by railways has been the desertion of the City as a residential quarter, and the growth of the suburbs in which most business people now live, going into town daily for business and returning home at night. This separation of the commercial man's home from his business has considerably altered the nature of London <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> life. New inventions also helped in accentuating this change. The first London telegraph from Paddington to West Drayton was opened in 1839, and a year later penny postage was introduced. In 1843 the Thames tunnel from Wapping to Rotherhithe was opened. In 1860 the volunteer movement arose under public apprehension of a French invasion. Many other additions to the buildings and thoroughfares of London were made during Queen Victoria's reign, among them being South Kensington Museum and the Public Record Office (1856); the Holborn Viaduct (1869); the Thames Embankment (1870); the Albert Hall and Burlington House (1871); the New Law Courts (1882); the Imperial Institute (1893) and the National Portrait Gallery (1896). The important changes which took place during this time in the administration of London, the formation first of the Metropolitan Board of Works and then of the London County Council, and the creation of numerous boroughs will be described later (see MODERN CIVIL ADMINISTRATION). Since the death of Queen Victoria, in 1901, London has added but little to its history, though street improvements, such as the opening of Kingsway and Aldwych and the widening of the Strand, continue to add to the convenience and beauty of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>. The opening of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a> in 1903 was not only noteworthy to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but has enriched London with one more impressive <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> feature, remarkable as being the only building in the Byzantine style in the capital.

<p>Some few historical notes on matters which have not been included in this outline of London's history may here be added, as falling more conveniently under separate heads.
<h3>The city corporation and guilds</h3>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the Merchant Guilds and Craft Guilds (see GUILDS, <em>In England</em>) were numerous and powerful in London. By a law of <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III</a> membership in a guild was a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> condition for obtaining the freedom of the city. Thus everyone belonged to a guild, and the guilds governed the city, even electing the lord mayor. The city was divided into twenty-six wards, which still exist: Aldersgate, Aldgate, Bassishaw, Billingsgate, Bishopsgate, Bread Street, Bridge, Bridge Without, Broad Street, Candlewick, Castle Baynard, Cheap, Coleman Street, Cordwainer, Cornhill, Cripplegate, Dowgate, Farringdon Within, Farringdon Without, Langbourn, Lime Street, Portsoken, Queenhithe, Tower, Walbrook, and Vintry. Each of these wards was and is represented by an alderman originally elected annually, but since the year 1394 for life. Each alderman is, by virtue of his office, a judge and magistrate for the whole city. The aldermen were assisted by common councillors, who were first appointed in the reign of Edward I, and in 1384 they were formed into the common council. Originally each ward elected two councillors, but the number has been increased and now the wards elect various numbers from four to sixteen. In 1840 the number of common councilmen was fixed at 206. They are elected annually.

<p>Though the common council has succeeded to the powers of the ancient "Folk Mote", that assembly is also represented by the Court of Common Hall, composed of the lord mayor, four aldermen and the liverymen of the city guilds. This body formerly elected the sheriffs of London and Middlesex, but since 1888 the election of the sheriff of Middlesex has been vested in the London County Council, and the Corporation elects two sheriffs of London. The Court of Common Hall also annually elects two aldermen who have served as sheriffs from whom the Court of Aldermen chooses the lord mayor for the coming year. Thus even now some power remains vested in the members of the guilds or, as they are now called, City Companies. Twenty-six of these companies still survive. They have but little connection with the crafts or trades whose names they bear, but they meet for social and ceremonial purposes, and for the administration of their charities, for many of them are very wealthy and contribute largely to benevolent objects, technical instruction and the like. Twelve of these guilds are known as the Greater Companies. They are: Goldsmiths (founded in 1327), Skinners (1327), Grocers (1345), Vintners (1363), Fishmongers (1363), Drapers (1364), Mercers (1393), Haberdashers (1448), Ironmongers (1464), Merchant Taylors (1466), Clothworkers (1480), and Salters (1530). Other important companies are Saddlers (1364), Cordwainers (1410), Armourers (1452), Barbers (1462), Stationers (1556), and Apothecaries (1615). Of these the Mercers, the first in order of civil precedence, have an income of 111,000 pounds a year, and fifteen of the companies have over 10,000 pounds a year.

<p>The city meetings are held in the Guildhall (erected 1411, rebuilt 1789, with a Gothic <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> added in 1867). It contains the great hall used for banquet and other ceremonial occasions, the common council chamber and some courts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. The official residence of the lord mayor, known as the Mansion House, was built in 1740. The chief civic officials are the recorder (first appointed in 1298), the chamberlain or treasurer, the town clerk, and the common serjeant. The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and administration of the corporation is restricted to the ancient limits of the City of London which cover about one square mile. As London grew beyond these in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, the corporation made no effort to expand its activities. So greater London has now its own government, and the "City of London" is a city within a city, retaining its autonomy, but in no way controlling the rest of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>. The arms of the city are argent, a cross gules charged on the first quarter, with a sword erect gules.
<h3>The trained-bands of London</h3>

<p>The lord mayors as heads of the corporation from the earliest days of their office exercised military command, and the corporation has always been ready to contribute grants of ships, men and money in moments of national emergency. The trained-bands formed for the defence of the city were originally divided into six regiments consisting of eight companies each. These regiments known as the Blue, Yellow, Green, Orange, White, and Red regiments, included at their full strength ten thousand men. From them emanated five regiments which hold the privilege of marching through the city with "the pomp of war", colours flying and bayonets fixed. These were 3rd Battalion Grenadier Guards, 3rd East Kent (Buffs), Royal Marines, Royal West London Militia, and Royal East London Militia. The two last named were united in 1820 as the Royal London Militia which about 1880 was made the 4th Battalion Royal Fusiliers.
<h2 id="section2">Ancient Catholic diocese</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/10168b.htm">St. Mellitus</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of London by St. Augustine in 604 has already been mentioned. <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> adds that "when this province received the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by the preaching of <a href="../cathen/10168b.htm">Mellitus</a>, King Ethelbert built the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Paul in the city of London where he and his successors should have their episcopal seat" (H. E., II, iii). Unfortunately we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether this <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was built on the site of the ancient church in which the Romano-British <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of London had previously had their seat. Of those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> nothing is known but the list of names already referred to. Theanus, Eluanus, Cadar, Obinus, Conanus, <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a>, Stephanus, Iltutus, Theodwinus, Theodredus, and Hilarius are said by vague tradition to have been predecessors of Restitutus who attended the <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> in 314, while he, it is said, was succeeded by Guitelinus, Fastidius, Wodinus, and Theonus. A century and a half had elapsed between the flight of the last British <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the coming of <a href="../cathen/10168b.htm">Mellitus</a>, and after his death nearly half a century elapses before we find the name of <a href="../cathen/03475a.htm">St. Cedd</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the East Saxons exercising episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, though he does not seem to have been called <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of London.

<p>Of this long list two stand out as <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, St. Erkenwald (14 Nov.), whose shrine was the centre of devotion in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">St. Dunstan</a> (19 May). Another, Roger Niger, was popularly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a saint. Six of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>; <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">St. Dunstan</a>, Robert of <a href="../cathen/08566a.htm">Jumi&egrave;ges</a>, Simon de Sudbury, Courtenay, John Kempe, and Wareham. The Saxon <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was burnt in 962 and rebuilt to be destroyed again in the fire of 1087. Bishop Maurice then erected a great Normal <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, served like its predecessors by secular canons. By the end of the twelfth century there were 30 endowed <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a> and the chapter held 24,000 acres of land as its corporate <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The Norman <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> was again rebuilt after the fire of 1136. Here it was that John resigned his kingdom to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and received it back from <a href="../cathen/11441a.htm">Pandulph</a> as a vassal. In St. Paul's, too, the nobles offered the kingdom to Louis the Dauphin in 1216. In 1232 the Council of St. Paul's was held, when Otho, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, published the Constitutions which formed so important a part of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> ecclesiastical law until the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. During this time the new choir was being built and this was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1240 in the presence of King Henry III, St. Edmund, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and Cardinal Otho the Legate. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was completed early in the fourteenth century by the erection of a very high steeple surmounted by a cross containing <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. In 1262 a long-standing dispute between the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and the Chapter of St. Paul's concerning <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> sede vacante was settled, the agreement being that the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> should appoint one out of certain canons presented by the chapter to rule the diocese till the election of the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In the fourteenth century Bishop Braybrooke vainly endeavoured to suppress the abuse by which the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> of St. Paul's was used as a market and common resort for business and even for amusements. Abundant references in <a href="../cathen/05458a.htm">English literature</a> show that this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> practice continued till the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in 1666.

<p>Up to the early years of the fifteenth century St. Paul's had preserved its own <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> use, known as Usus Sancti Pauli, but on 15 Oct., 1414, the <a href="../cathen/13479a.htm">Sarum Rite</a>, then commonly used through the greater part of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, was substituted for it, and remained in use till the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> presided at the greater festivals, the dean on ordinary days. The dean with the <a href="../cathen/12372a.htm">precentor</a>, the treasurer, the chancellor, and the <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendaries</a> formed the chapter. Next came the twelve petty canons and six vicars choral, while there were fifty <a href="../cathen/03573c.htm">chantry</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> attached to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, divided into the four archdeaconries of London, Essex, Middlesex, and Colchester, included the counties of Middlesex, Essex, and part of Hertfordshire. The foundation of St. Paul's School by Dean Colet, in 1512, was the only other important event concerning the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of London until the reign of <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>. When the religious troubles began none of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> made any stand against the king. In August, 1538, the Great Rood and the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Our Lady of Grace were removed; in 1547 all the altars were demolished and the church plate and vestments were sold by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Dean May. Under Mary, <a href="../cathen/02675a.htm">Bishop Bonner</a> was restored to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and the Mass was again celebrated till the first year of Elizabeth. With the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of the Bishop and the deprivation of the London <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who remained faithful to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the history of London as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> diocese closes.
<h2 id="section3">London Catholics after the Reformation</h2>

<p>For the first few years of Elizabeth's reign the existing <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who became known as "Marian" <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, administered to the needs of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> and giving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in secret. When they began to die out their numbers were reinforced by the "seminary priests" sent from the college founded by <a href="../cathen/01322b.htm">Cardinal Allen</a> at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> (1568), from the English College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and from later foundations at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, and elsewhere. Under Elizabeth more than eighty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> went to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in London alone, and a far larger number perished in the various <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>. After the death of <a href="../cathen/02675a.htm">Bishop Bonner</a> as a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> in 1569 there was no episcopal government, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> did as best they could, not only in London but throughout <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In 1598 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> appointed an <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a>, George Blackwell, with <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He was succeeded in turn by George Birkhead (1608-1614) and <a href="../cathen/07143c.htm">William Harrison</a> (1615-1621). During this period a fierce controversy divided <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, some desiring and other opposing the appointment of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> decided this in 1623 by appointing Dr. William Bishop as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In that same year there occurred in London the "Fatal Vespers", when a large body of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and others, who were assembled at the French Embassy to hear a sermon by <a href="../cathen/05165a.htm">Father Drury, S.J</a>, were precipitated from the upper floor to the ground, and very many of them killed. About the same time an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> named Gee published a pamphlet, "The Foot out of the Snare", in which he gave a list of 263 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> then secretly resident in London. As there were probably others he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing of, the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> must still have been very considerable, though we have no means of estimating their numbers at this period.

<p>In 1624 Dr. Bishop died and was succeeded by Dr. Richard Smith, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03554a.htm">Chalcedon</a>, but his position became so difficult that in 1631 he withdrew to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he lived till his death in 1655. From that time till the accession of James II no <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> was appointed and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> continued to be exercised by the chapter, a body appointed by Dr. Bishop and which was chosen from the most experienced <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from all parts of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The chapter held deliberative assemblies from time to time in London. In the reign of Charles I <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> had ceased altogether in London, though after the king's departure they again commenced and fourteen <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were executed then and under the Commonwealth. The Restoration brought another respite, but the Titus <a href="../cathen/11173c.htm">Oates Plot</a> of 1678 caused a fresh outbreak of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and fourteen more <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at Tyburn or Tower Hill, including <a href="../cathen/07504a.htm">Ven. William Howard</a>, Viscount Stafford, and <a href="../cathen/12169b.htm">Ven. Oliver Plunket</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, who was the last <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> to suffer in London (1 July, 1681). The accession of James II raised new hopes among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> and the presence of a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal envoy</a>, <a href="../cathen/01136b.htm">Mgr. d'Adda</a>, and the public attendance of the king and queen at Mass were evident signs of toleration. Chapels and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were opened and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers and printers readily seized the opportunity of producing devotional and controversial works in increased numbers. Once more the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> appointed a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, Bishop John Leyburn (q.v.), who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 9 Sept., 1685.

<p>Two years later the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was divided between him and Bonaventure Giffard, but almost immediately a fresh arrangement was made and on 30 Jan., 1688, <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Pope Innocent XI</a> created four vicariates, London, Midland, Northern and Western. Bishop Leyburn became the first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of the London District, which included the counties of Kent, Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Sussex, Hants, Berks, Bedford, Bucks, and Hertford, and the islands of Wight, Jersey, and Guernsey; while in process of time they acquired <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all British possessions in North America, of which <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> and <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> and some of the West Indian islands contained most <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Unfortunately the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">Revolution</a> in the same year put a sudden and complete end to the short-lived hopes of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Chapels and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were closed, one <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and a printing-press were wrecked by the mob, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had to withdraw once again into concealment. A penal system was now devised to crush <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> without bloodshed by civil and political disabilities. With this aim fresh persecuting <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> were passed under William and Mary, under which common informers were entitled to a reward for procuring convictions, a provision which was a fruitful source of trouble for nearly a century to come. One of these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> (I William &amp; Mary, c. 9, s. 2) required all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, with certain exceptions, to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance, which was so phrased as to be unlawful in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, or in default to be convicted of <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">recusancy</a>. This act, however, was not very rigorously enforced, but the penal code as a whole weighed heavily on <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, especially after the abortive Stuart rising in 1745.

<p>The chief events concerning London <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> during the eighteenth century were the long episcopate of the Venerable Bishop Challoner; the petty <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> carried on by common informers (1767-1778); the First <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Relief Act (1778), and the <a href="../cathen/06649c.htm">Gordon Riots</a> which broke out in consequence thereof (1780); the Second <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Relief Act (1791); the dissensions arising from the action of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Committee, and the influx of French <em>&eacute;migr&eacute;</em> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. Chapels and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> now began to be opened without concealment. The refugees from <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> went to Old Hall, in Hertfordshire, where a small <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> had secretly existed since 1769, and there Bishop Douglass established St. Edmund's College as the place of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the London District. His successor opened the large church at Moorfields, which long served as the Pro-cathedral of London (1820-1865). In 1829 the Catholic Emancipation Act removed from <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> nearly all their remaining restrictions and since then they have taken their places in Parliament, on the judicial bench, and at the bar. Among <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the Crown there have been Sir Charles Russell (afterwards Lord Russell of Killowen), Attorney General (1892-1894), Mr. Henry Matthews, now Lord Llandaff, Home Secretary (1885-1892), the Duke of Norfolk, Postmaster General (1885-1900), and the <a href="../cathen/13062d.htm">Marquess of Ripon</a>, Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> (1880-1884), First Lord of Admiralty (1886), Secretary for the Colonies (1892-1895), Lord Privy Seal (1905-1908). In the High Court of Justice there have been five <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> judges:-- Sir William Shee (1863-1868), Sir James Mathew (1881-1906), Sir John Day (1882-1901), Lord Russell of Killowen, Lord Chief Justice of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (1895-1900), and Sir John Walton (1901). Two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, father and son, have attained the position of Lord Mayor of London, Sir Stuart Knill (1892-1893) and Sir John Knill (1909-1910). Since the Emancipation Act there has been an extraordinary development of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life in every direction, greatly helped by two movements, the large <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> immigration in 1847 and the conversions resulting from the <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a>. The increase in numbers is shown by the episcopal reports to <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> previous to the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>:

<p>In 1840 <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a> redistributed <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> into eight vicariates, on which occasion the London District lost Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. Ten years later <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a> restored the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>; the London District ceased to exist and its place was taken by the new Dioceses of Westminster and Southwark, the former including all London north of the Thames and the counties of Middlesex, Essex, and Hertford, the latter embracing London south of the Thames and the rest of the old vicariate.

<p>There are no means of ascertaining even approximately the total number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> now in London, but it is estimated variously from 300,000 to 400,000.

<h2 id="section4">Modern civil administration </h2>
<h3>Local government</h3>

<p>It has already been seen that the extent of the city of London, properly so-called, was limited by the ancient walls, and that there grew up a vast new city surrounding the ancient one and gradually absorbing all the outlying villages. Until 1855 the city itself was governed by ancient charters, and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> by <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> systems under various Acts of Parliament. The Metropolis Local Management Act of 1855 created the Metropolitan Board of Works, the 45 members of which were elected by thirty-nine vestries, or district boards. Originally established for the construction of sewers, it was entrusted by later Acts with very many other <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and powers, including all street improvements, the care of parks and open spaces, and the maintenance of the fire-brigade. But this new body in no way affected the City corporation, which preserved all its original <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> within the City boundaries. This state of things continued until 1889, when the Local Government Act of 1888 came into operation. This Act created an administrative county of London, which covers an area of 121 square miles. The City of London was very slightly affected by the Act and is still governed by the City corporation. For non-administrative purposes, such as quarter-sessions and justices, the City and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> form two counties, known respectively as the County of the City of London and the County of London.

<p><em>(a) The City of London</em>

<p>The government of the City proper by the lord mayor, aldermen and common councilmen has already been described. The lord mayor is elected annually on 29 Sept. from the aldermen who have served as sheriffs. The electors are the "livery" consisting of the freemen of London. The new lord mayor is sworn into office on 8 Nov., and on the following day makes his final declaration of office before the Lord Chief Justice of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The state procession on this occasion is popularly known as the Lord Mayor's Show. The City corporation retains within its proper limits its civil and criminal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and full <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of local government. It returns two members to Parliament.

<p><em>(b) The London County Council</em>

<p>The County of London consists of twenty-eight boroughs, each of which is ruled by a mayor and corporation &#151; Battersea; Bermondsey; Bethnal Green; Camberwell; Chelsea; Deptford; Finsbury; Fulham; Greenwich; Hackney; Hammersmith; Hampstead; Holborn; Islington; Kensington; Lambeth; Lewisham; Paddington; Poplar; St. Marylebone; St. Pancras; Shoreditch; Southwark; Stepney; Stoke Newington; Wandsworth; Westminster, City of; Woolwich. These boroughs form the local administrative authorities, and act as local sanitary authorities, are the overseers of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, collect the rates, are responsible for making, lighting, and regulating the streets, and providing public baths and <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>. But the central administration remains in the London County Council, consisting of 138 members, viz., a chairman, 19 aldermen, and 118 councillors. The powers of this council are very wide, including all <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> formerly belonging to the Metropolitan Board of Works in connexion with drainage, parks and open spaces, fire-brigades, street improvements, tramways, artisans' dwellings, infant life protection, etc. Secondly, those transferred from the former county-justices with regard to reformatory and industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, lunatic asylums, music and dancing licenses, coroners, etc. Thirdly, powers as to highways, supervision of common lodging-houses and licensing of slaughter-houses. Fourthly, new powers conferred by recent Acts of Parliament as to registration of electors, public health, historic buildings and monuments, suppression of nuisances, reformatories for inebriates, and the administration of Acts such as the Shop Hours Act, Employment of Children Act, and Midwives Act. Fifthly, under the Education (London) Act 1903, the Council became the authority for all public <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the county. Sixthly, powers connected with the raising and loaning of money and the sanctioning of loans required for all the local authorities in the county. Most of the business is done by committees and the Council meets weekly to consider their reports. Its annual expenditure is about 16,000,000 pounds, of which 5,000,000 pounds are spent on <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The outlay is met by two main sources of supply, capital money raised by the issue of stock, and current income raised by a county rate. The rating for the year 1908-9 amounts to three shillings in the pound (15 per cent), and the assessable value of the County of London, on 6 April, 1908, was 44,332,025 pounds.
<h3>Education</h3>

<p><em>(a) London University</em>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was instituted in 1836 as an examining body for conferring degrees, and was reconstituted in 1900. Since then it has possessed an "academic" department for the organization and control of higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and an "external" department for continuing its former functions of examining students and conferring degrees. Its teaching is conducted (i) by the University itself; (ii) by several "Schools of the University"; (iii) at other institutions in which there are "Recognized Teachers of the University". In 1900 University College (Gower Street), an institution founded in 1828 on undenominational principles, was made a "School of the University" in the faculties of arts, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, medicine, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, engineering, and economics, and on 1 Jan., 1907, it was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of which it is now an integral part. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> also maintains the Physiological Laboratory at South Kensington and Goldsmiths' College at New Cross.

<p><em>(b) Higher Education</em>

<p>Other institutions for higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> are King's College, founded as a <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> establishment in 1828, also a "School of the London University", in the same faculties as University College, with the addition of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and Gresham College, founded in 1597 by Sir Thomas Gresham, where lectures are given in divinity, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, music, and medicine. Professional <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> is afforded in connexion with various bodies; medical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are attached to all the great <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>; lectures in law are given at the Inns of Court and the Incorporated Law Society; music is taught at the Royal Academy of Music (founded 1822), Royal College of Music (1883), Guildhall School of Music and elsewhere; art at the Royal Academy Schools of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture, as also at the London University.

<p><em>(c) Secondary Education</em>

<p>The chief London <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are St. Paul's and Westminster. The former was established by Dean Colet in 1512, and was removed about 1880 from St. Paul's church-yard to Hammersmith. The latter was endowed by Queen Elizabeth in 1560, and provides for forty king's scholars on the foundation in addition to the day boys. Christ's Hospital, the Blue Coat School, founded by Edward VI in 1533 [sic] with nearly 1200 children on the foundation, is now situated at Horsham; and the Charterhouse School, established by Sir Thomas Sutton in 1611, has been removed to Godalming, the site of the old <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> being now occupied by the Merchant Taylors School, a <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> foundation. Mention must also be made of the City of London School (founded 1835), University College School, King's College School, Dame Owen's School, Islington, the Mercers' Grammar School, and St. Olave's School, Southwark. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> include the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the Brothers of Mercy at Highgate, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> School at Ealing, St. Ignatius's College, Stamford Hill, and the Sacred Heart College at Wimbledon, both conducted by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and the Salesian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Battersea.

<p><em>(d) Elementary Education</em>

<p>Until 1870, when a School Board for London was instituted, the only organizations for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> the poorer classes were the British and Foreign School Society (founded 1808) and the National Society (1811). Under the Education Act 1903, the London County Council became the authority for all public <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, both secondary and elementary. The Education committee consists of thirty-eight members of the council and twelve co-opted members. The estimates for the year 1908-9 amounted to 5,437,908 pounds, of which 4,442,007 pounds is for elementary and 995,901 pounds for higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. In addition to the council <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> there are a large number of "provided" <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> established by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> or by the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>. In 1905 there were 554,646 scholars in the council <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 205,323 in the "provided" <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.
<h3>Civil and criminal jurisdiction</h3>

<p>The High Court of Justice for the whole of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> is situate in The Strand. It includes the Appeal Court and the Chancery, King's Bench, and Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty Divisions. For the special requirements of London there is the Central Criminal Court at the Old Bailey, the Court of Quarter Sessions held at Newington and Clerkenwell, the Police Courts presided over by <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> police magistrates, and for civil causes of minor importance the County Courts. The City of London has its own Court of Quarter Sessions, and the Lord Mayor, sitting at the Mansion House or Guildhall, has the powers of justices in petty session of a police magistrate.
<h3>Trade and commerce</h3>

<p>The position of London and its intercourse with every part of the world have combined to make it financially rather than commercially the world's <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>. Being a market far removed from any great manufacturing centre, there is a great excess of imports over exports. The port of London in spite of some drawbacks is still the greatest port in the world in respect of the amount of shipping and goods which enter it. In 1907 the tonnage of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> and foreign vessels engaged in the foreign trade entered and cleared was 11,160,367 tons entered and 8,598,979 tons cleared, as against Liverpool's record of 8,167,419 tons entered and 7,257,869 tons cleared. The total shipping entering it is about one-fifth of the total shipping of the United Kingdom; the value of imports one-third, and the value of exports one-fourth of the total value of the national imports and exports. Steps are now being taken for dock extension and a reconstitution of the port and dock authorities.
<h3>London charities</h3>

<p>Even a bare enumeration of the various charitable agencies which labour for the relief of distress in London would be beyond the limits of this article. For detailed information reference should be made to the "Annual Charities Register and Digest", which is a classified register of charities in or available for the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>, together with a digest of information respecting the legal, <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, and other means for the prevention and relief of distress, and the improvement of the condition of the poor. For <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charities see the "Catholic Social Year Book", and the "Handbook of Catholic Charitable and Social Works", both published by the <a href="../cathen/15077a.htm">Catholic Truth Society</a>. As, in addition to non-sectarian organizations, every religious body has its own agencies, and the public authorities are now empowered by statute to exercise responsibilities which narrow the field of charity, there is considerable overlapping. At the present moment there is a crying need for systematic co-ordination among the various charities, and could this be effectually arranged, efficiency and economy would gain alike. Turning first to statutory provision for charitable relief, this is divided among various bodies. The administration of Poor Law relief is vested in the Board of Guardians, subject to the direction and control of the Local Government Board; the Metropolitan Asylums Board is responsible for the insane, and some classes of the sick, and the London County Council has also certain <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, especially with regard to the suitable housing of the poor. The Charity Commissioners have large statutory powers over endowed charities, but much remains to be done in the direction of remodelling some of these <a href="../cathen/15072a.htm">charitable trusts</a> on wise principles.

<p>Turning to <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> charities, a very important part is played by the London Charity Organisation Society, a federation of thirty-eight district committees, and a central council. Its object is to direct into the most effectual channels the forces of benevolence. All agencies and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> interested in charity in each Poor Law Union are invited to the local district committee. These committees form centres of information, and investigate and deal with cases brought before them on the twofold principle that thorough investigation should precede relief, and that relief given should be suitable and adequate. Cases to which adequate relief cannot be supplied are left to the Poor Law. The various organizations which, in co-operation with this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, or independently, relieve distress may be divided into several classes:

<ul> <li><em>Relief in affliction</em>, involving the care of the blind, deaf, dumb, cripples, lunatics, inebriates, idiots, imbeciles, the mentally defective, epileptics, and incurables. <li><em>Relief in sickness</em>, which embraces the work of the general <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, special <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, surgical aid <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, medical and surgical homes, convalescent homes, dispensaries, and nursing institutions. <li><em>Relief in permanent distress</em>, which includes homes for the aged and incapacitated, pensions, homes for the employed (working boys, etc.), homes for children, and day nurseries. <li><em>Relief in temporary distress</em>, affording shelter of various kinds, relief in money, and relief in kind. <li><em>Reformatory relief</em>, including reformatories, certified industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners'</a> aid <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, and institutions for fallen <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. <li><em>Miscellaneous relief</em>, under which head may be grouped the various emigration <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, life protection <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, training farms for the unemployed, and social and physical improvement <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. </ul>

<p>Purely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charities are very numerous. The Aged Poor Society (founded in 1708), and the Benevolent Society for the Aged and Infirm Poor (established 1761) both give pensions. At Nazareth House, Hammersmith, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a> at Notting Hill, there are homes for the aged poor. There are almshouses at Brook Green, Chelsea, and Ingatestone. Homes and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for boys and girls are very numerous, and a great work is done by the "Crusade of Rescue and Homes for Destitute Catholic Children", which now maintains over a thousand children. The visiting and relief of the poor is chiefly in the hands of two <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a>, and the Ladies of Charity. There are four <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>: that of St. John and St. Elizabeth, in St. John's Wood, under the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>; the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, under the Servants of the Sacred Heart; the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, under the Sisters of Charity; and the Hospital for the Dying, at Hackney, under the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Sisters of Charity. There is a home for epileptic children, under the <a href="../cathen/16030b.htm">Daughters of the Cross</a>, at Much Hadham. There are industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys at Manor Park; for girls, at Isleworth; a reformatory <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys at Walthamstow; and the Prisoners' Aid Society visits <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> and helps them on release. The charitable clubs for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are too numerous to recapitulate.
