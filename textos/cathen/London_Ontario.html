<h1>London (Ontario)</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF LONDON (LONDINENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, established 21 February, 1855; see transferred to Sandwich, 2 February, 1859, transferred back to London, 3 October, 1869; comprises Middlesex, Elgin, Norfolk, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, Perth, <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a>, Lambion, Kent, and Essex Counties in the south-western section of <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. The incorporation of the city of London and its selection as the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of a new diocese in 1856 were contemporaneous. It then had a population of about 10,000, a fifth of whom were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. As first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the Rev. Pierre-Adolphe Pinsonnault, a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Sulpician, was chosen. He was born at Saint-Philippe, Quebec, 23 November, 1815, made his studies in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> and in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in the latter city in 1840. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, 13 May, 1856. On 2 February, 1859, he procured a pontifical <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> altering the title of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to Sandwich, and authorizing the change of residence to that location. He resigned the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> on 18 December, 1866, and died at <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, 30 January, 1883. As his successor, the Very Reverend John Walsh, V.G., <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, was chosen and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 10 November, 1867. Born in Mooncoin, Co. Kilkenny, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 24 May, 1830, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 1 November, 1854, and spent the years previous to his elevation to the episcopate in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work. He was promoted to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, 25 July, 1889, and died there on 31 July, 1898. In October, 1869, he transferred his residence from Sandwich to London, and on 15 November procured from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> making London once more the name of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He began the erection of a new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> May, 1881, and largely increased the number of churches and institutions throughout the diocese.

<p>The third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the Rev. Denis O'Connor, a <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a>, and superior of the Assumption College, Sandwich, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 19 October, 1890. He was born at Pickering, <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, 28 March, 1841, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 8 December, 1863. Like his predecessor, he was elevated to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, 24 January, 1899. To fill the vacancy thus created the Rev. Fergus Patrick McEvay, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07123a.htm">Diocese of Hamilton</a>, was named and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 6 August, 1899. Bishop McEvay was born at Lindsay, <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a>, on 8 December, 1852, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 9 July, 1882. Again, Toronto made a vacancy in the See of London, for Archbishop O'Connor resigned and Bishop McEvay was transferred to <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, and took possession on 17 June, 1908. As fifth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of London, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appointed on 14 December, 1909, the Very Rev. Michael M.F. Fallon, <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the American province of the <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>. He was born at <a href="../cathen/08658a.htm">Kingston</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, 17 May, 1867, and entered the Oblate congregation at the conclusion of his course at Ottawa University. His <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies were completed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, after which he became professor and vice-rector of his <a href="../cathen/01326c.htm">Alma</a> Mater. At the end of three years he began <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work at Ottawa continuing it at <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>. In 1903 he was chosen <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the Oblates.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities now established in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are:&mdash; <em>men:</em> <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilians</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>; <em>women:</em> Religious of the Sacred Heart, <a href="../cathen/10678a.htm">Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary</a>, Sisters of Loretto (Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary), <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, Hospitalier Nuns of St. Joseph at Hotel Dieu, Windsor. Statistics: Priests 70 (religious 18); there are 45 churches with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and also 29 missions with churches, total number of churches 78; 1 college, 150 students; 4 academies, 470 pupils; 85 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 11,500 pupils; 1 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, 75 inmates; 3 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population 60,000.
