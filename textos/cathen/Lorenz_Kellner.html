<h1>Lorenz Kellner</h1>  

<p>Educationist, born at Kalteneber in the district of Eichsfeld, 29 January, 1811; died at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, 18 August, 1892. He was the son of Heinrich Kellner who had been a pupil of <a href="../cathen/11742b.htm">Pestalozzi</a> at Yverdon and had introduced <a href="../cathen/11742b.htm">Pestalozzi's</a> methods at the normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> he conducted, the first of its kind in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> district of Eichsfeld. Out of these private courses for the training of elementary school-teachers developed the still-existing <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for teachers at Heiligenstadt. Lorenz Kellner graduated at the Gymnasium Josephinum at <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, and then studied with great success at the evangelical <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for teachers at <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>. After being a teacher at the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Erfurt for two years, he was made <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; in both positions he showed great talent for teaching and a genuine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of children. In 1836 his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was enlarged into a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for teachers, of which the elder Kellner remained the head while Lorenz was made his only assistant. In 1848 von Eichhorn, the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> of worship and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, called Lorenz to Marienwerder in West <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> as member of the government district council and of the school-board. After labouring at Marienwerder for seven years Kellner was summoned to fill the same offices at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. As there were at this <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> no institutions for the training of teachers in <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, Kellner founded several <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> both for male and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> teachers during the twenty-nine years of his official activity here. In his chief work, "Praktischer Lehrgang f&uuml;r den deutschen Unterricht" (1837-40), the teaching of grammar was systematically connected with the reading-book. This was, for that period, a very important advance when contrasted with the current methods of grammatical instruction. In 1850 appeared his best-known work, "Zur P&auml;dagogik der Schule und des Hauses. Aphorismen", which was translated into several languages. It contains altogether 178 essays which cover the entire field of training and teaching. His "Skizzen und Bilder aus der Erziehungsgeschichte" (3 vols., 1862) was the first and also the best treatment of the history of pedagogics by a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> author. In 1863 the Academy of M&uuml;nster in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> made Kellner Doctor of Philosophy <em>honoris causa</em>, in recognition of his services on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German language</a> and of pedagogics. Kellner's "Kurze Geschichte der Erziehung und des Unterrichts" (1877) is a book of practical suggestions for teachers; his "Volksschulkunde" was a theoretical and practical guide for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers of both sexes, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> inspectors, and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. His "Lebensbl&auml;tter, Erinnerungen aus der Schulwelt" (1891) is a work of great interest. After his death was published "Lose Bl&auml;tter, P&auml;dagog. Zeitbetrachtungen und Ratschl&auml;ge von Kellner" (1897).
