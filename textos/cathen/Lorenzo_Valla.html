<h1>Lorenzo Valla</h1>  

<p>(DELLA VALLE).

<p><a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanist</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1405; d. there, 1 Aug., 1457. His father came from Placentia. He studied Latin under Leonardo Bruni (Aretino) and Greek under <a href="../cathen/02112a.htm">Giovanni Aurispa</a>. At the age of 24 he wished to obtain a position in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> secretariate, but was considered too young. After his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> death he accepted a chair of eloquence in the <a href="../cathen/11593a.htm">University of Pavia</a>, where he wrote his treatise "De voluptate" (1431), an emended edition of which appeared later under the title, "De vero bono". On account of his open letter attacking the jurist Bartolo (1433) and ridiculing the contemporary <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> he was forced to leave Pavia. He went to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and later to <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, made another effort to succeed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and finally settled at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> (1433), where he became secretary to Alfonso of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, whose Court, frequented by the most distinguished writers, was a hotbed of licentiousness and debauchery. Lorenzo confesses that his life there, like his previous life, was not free from moral stain. At <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> he wrote "De libero arbitrio", "Dialecticae disputationes", "Declamazione contro la donazione di Constantino" (1440), "De professione religiosorum" (1442, not printed until by Vahlen in 1869). In 1444 he had a controversy with Fra Antonio da Bitonto on the question of the composition of the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> by each of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. His <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> elucubrations <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be tried for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, but the trial was discontinued through the intervention of King Alfonso. His standard work is "De elegantia linguae latinae", which first placed the study of Latin on a scientific basis. He had laboured on it from 1435, and in 1444 it was published through the indiscretion of <a href="../cathen/02112a.htm">Aurispa</a>. The Humanists who preceded him had formed their Latin style rather empirically, and consequently had admitted many constructions peculiar to popular Latin. Though Valla had refrained from personalities, all the literary writers considered his work a provocation, and hurled invectives against the author. This controversy is one of the most unpleasant pages in the history of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. The fiercest aggressor was Poggio Bracciolini, who did not confine himself to pointing out <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of style in Valla's works, but accused him of the most degrading vices. Valla's no less virulent answers are collect in his "Invectivarum libri sex". Poggio's invectives could not but create a bad impression at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; as Valla still hoped to obtain a position in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>, he wrote an "Apologia ad Eugenio IV", excusing himself for his faults and promising amendment. But it was only after the election of <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> that he found favour (1448), obtaining first the position of <em>scriptor</em>, and later of Apostolic secretary. <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Callistus III</a> bestowed on him a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> in St. John Lateran, which he was able to hold but for a few years. By order of <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> he translated various Greek authors.

<p>His <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works are interesting. In his "Disputazioni dialettiche" he bitterly opposes <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>, but he treats his subject superficially, and rather as a grammarian than as a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. He made no positive contribution to philosophy, but only helped to discredit <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>. His most discussed work is the dialogue "De voluptate". In this Leonardo Bruni (Arentino) defends the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that a life conformed to nature is the <em><a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">summum bonum</a></em>; Antonio Beccadelli (Panormita) strongly favours <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureanism</a>, declaring that the desire of pleasure is to be restrained only lest it might be an obstacle to a greater pleasure and that continence is contrary to nature; finally, Niccolo Niccoli speaks against both in favour of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07187a.htm">hedonism</a>, holding that perpetual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is the <em><a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">summum bonum</a></em>, and that virtue is practised only as a means of obtaining it. It is uncertain whether Beccadelli or Niccoli (who is declared victor by the onlookers) expresses Valla's personal opinion. It would seem that he had not then (1431) come to a definitive opinion. He confines himself to expounding the three opinions, but gives <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureanism</a> the most ardent and eloquent defender. The way in which his "Apologia" extenuates what had been said in "De voluptate", arguing on the meaning of the Latin word <em>voluptas</em>, shows that he was undecided.

<p>In the "Declamazione contro la donazione di Costantino", probably inspired by Alfonso, who was at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Augene IV for possession of the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>, Valla exhorted the Romans to rebel and their leaders to deprive the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of his temporal power, which he deems the cause of all the evils then afflicting <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The "Annotazioni sul testo latino del Nuovo Testamento" deals chiefly with the Latinity, and less frequently with the translation itself. In the "De professione religiosorum" he denies that the religious state is the most perfect, as there is greater merit in acting spontaneously than in fulfilling what one is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to do by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, and he taxes the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> with arrogance for calling themselves religious, as if other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were not so; he refrains, however, from trying to discredit them by relating salacious stories as the other Humanists delighted in doing. In the "De libero arbitrio" he concedes that the foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not incompatible with <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, but maintains that our intellects are unable to comprehend this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Valla first gave expression to many <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> that were taken up later, especially by the reformers. Like the other Humanists of his age he lacked firmness of character.
