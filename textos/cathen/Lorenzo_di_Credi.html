<h1>Lorenzo di Credi</h1>  

<p>Florentine <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1459; d. there, 1537. <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> gives his family name as Sciarpelloni, but his original name seems to have been Barducci. He was a pupil first of the goldsmith Credi, from whom he took his name, and then of the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> <a href="../cathen/15364d.htm">Verrocchio</a>, having as fellow-pupils <a href="../cathen/11737b.htm">Perugino</a> and <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo da Vinci</a>. To the latter <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> Lorenzo attached himself in terms of friendship, and he copied the manner of <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo</a> with great success. When Verrocchio went to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to cast the bronze equestrian <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Colleoni, he left to Lorenzo the entire administration of all his affairs, and in his will charged him to complete the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, which he had been unable to finish, adding the following remark: "Because he has the ability to finish it properly". <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo</a> was, however, instructed by the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> to complete the figure. Di Credi was a devout follower of <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a> and a man of deeply <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>. He was an eminent portrait-painter, and his religious pictures were in great demand for the churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of Florence and the neighbourhood. One of the finest is at Pistoja, originally <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> for the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of the Ceppo. The portrait of Verrocchio is at Florence. Other examples are at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>, London, Paris, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>. They are all remarkable for their magnificence of colour, exquisite composition, but extraordinary rigidity of drapery, the folds having the appearance of metal work in many cases and revealing the original training as a goldsmith which the artist received. He died at the age of seventy-eight in his own house in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, near Santa Maria Nuova, and was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in San Pietro Maggiore. A little while before his death he bequeathed to the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Nuova a farm which he had purchased at Casciano. He was said to have been a very slow <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, but took immense pains in the execution of all he did, prepared and ground all his own colours, and finished his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> with exquisite refinement and care.
