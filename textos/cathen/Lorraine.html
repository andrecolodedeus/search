<h1>Lorraine</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Origin</h2>

<p>By the Treaty of Verdun in 843, the empire of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> was divided in three parts: Ludwig the German received Eastern Franconia; Charles the Bald, Western Franconia; and Lothair I, the strip of land lying between the two and reaching from the North Sea to the Rhone, with <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in addition. After the death of Lothair I, in 855, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> passed to his son Lothair II, who gave his name to the district henceforth known as <em>Lotharii Regnum</em> &mdash; Lotharingen, Lothringen, or Lorraine. Lorraine did not form a geographical unit, like two great neighbouring kingdoms, complete in themselves and by their natural formation. Its boundaries were uncertain for though the Meuse was on the west, the Rhine on the east, and the sea on the north, yet to the south it was completely exposed. The population, which in the eastern kingdom was Germanic, and in the western Roman, here combined both elements. Lorraine, moreover, included within its boundaries the original home of the Austrasian dynasty, with Aachen, <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> capital, and the most important centres of ancient culture: two archbishoprics (Cologne and <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>), many <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> (Metz, Toul, <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, etc.), <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and royal castles. From the beginning it was coveted by the neighbouring princes, who succeeded, one after another, in seizing parts or the whole of its territory. The composite character of its origin also led to endless internal <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>.

<p>The territory afterwards known as Lorraine was <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> while still under Roman domination. Missionaries came thither from <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> whose first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was <a href="../cathen/05594a.htm">St. Eucharius</a> (about 250). One of his successors, Maternus (313-14), founded the See of Cologne. About 811 <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> became an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, the episcopal Sees of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, Toul, and Verdun being suffragan to it. From 511 Metz was capital of Austrasia, and became a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in the sixth century, one of its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> being <a href="../cathen/03729b.htm">St. Chrodegang</a>(742-66). Toul and Verdun have been <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> since the fourth century. Under Bishop Hildebold, in 799, Cologne received from <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> and <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>. The two great archbishoprics early became temporal lordships. <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> obtained its temporal power in 898, under Radbod, through Duke Zuentebulch of Lorraine; Bruno, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> (953-65), himself obtained the dignity of Duke of Lorraine. Both archbishoprics became imperial principalities. Metz and Verdun were later raised to the same dignity. With the close of the sixth century began the foundation of the numerous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which spread from the Vosges, and to which Lorraine owed its advanced culture. Its people were remarkable through the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> for their religious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. The most ancient of these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> is Luxeuil founded by St. Columba, whose example was followed by Amatus, Romarich, Deodatus, Godelbert, Hidulf, and Chrodegang, who founded the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of Remiremont, St. Die, Senones, Moyen-Moutier, St. Michiel, and Gooze. There were other famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the different <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, such as those of <a href="../cathen/10077a.htm">St. Maximinus</a> at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, St. Epure of Toul, Symphorian, Glossinda, and St. Peters at <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>. Under the Carlovingians the number increased. Richilde, wife of Charles the Bald, founded Juvigny near Stenay about 874; Bishop Adventius of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, Neum&uuml;nster; while St. Germain, St. Martin on the Meuse, and Gellamont near Dieulouard also date back to this period. In these <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> abodes and in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> residences celebrated <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> flourished, among which St. Mathias near <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, the Abbey of Pr&uuml;m, famous for the historian Regino, and Verdun with its Bertarius attained great prominence. The councils of Meaux, in 845, of <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a>, in 855, and of Savonni&egrave;res, near Toul, in 859 improved these <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and founded new ones.

<p>For political reasons, Lothair II ceded small portions of his domains to his neighbours: to his brother Charles, the <a href="../cathen/02415a.htm">Diocese of Belley</a> and Moutiers; to Louis of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, provinces in the Upper Jura and the Vaud; to Louis the German, Alsace. After his death, in 869, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> immediately broke out, as almost always occurred upon the death of a ruler of Lorraine. The Kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, as well as Louis of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, wished to seize the country; Louis the German was victorious, and, by the Treaty of Meersen, in 870, far the greater part was awarded to him--all the territory east and north of the Meuse and the territory and cities on the Moselle, on both sides of the Rhine, and in Jura, that is to say Friesland, the country of the Ripuarian <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> the original lands of the House of Lorraine, Alsace, and a part of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. Charles the Bald received the countries on the left bank of the Meuse and the Moselle. After the death of Louis the German (876) Charles tried, but failed, to reconquer Lorraine. Louis the Younger, in 879, after the death of Louis the Stammerer, repossessed himself of the French, western, half of Lorraine, and thus once more united the entire <em>Regnum Lotharii</em> under German rule. Under Charles the Fat, a natural son of Lothair II named Hugo disturbed the peace by calling in to his aid the Norman Godfrey, who acquired Friesland as a fief. Both, however, were severely defeated in 888. King Arnulf (887-99) expelled the Normans, gaining a victory at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> (891), and improved the religious situation by summoning the great Council of Tibour (895). At the same time, in order to secure Lorraine as a part of Westmark, he gave it to his natural son, Zuentebulch, who surrendered the management of state affairs to Archbishop Radbod of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, as his chancellor. Zuentebulch was overthrown in an insurrection raised by the mightiest nobles of the country, Gerard, Matfried, and Reginar, on 13 August, 900. Gradually the supremacy passed over to Reginar of Hainault and Haspengau, who, after the death of Louis the Child (912), brought Lorraine under the allegiance of Charles the Simple of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and in return received from him the dignity of margrave (Lord of the Marches) and duke. To these titles his son Giselbert succeeded in 913. Under Giselbert, the disputes about the succession to the throne of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> gave rise to internal divisions among the people of Lorraine. Henry I (919-36) was called by one party to its assistance and, after repeated invasions, recovered all of Lorraine for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (925). He confirmed Giselbert in the Duchy, and, in 928, gave him his own daughter Gerberga in marriage. In spite of this, Giselbert once more allied himself with the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Louis IV, against the German <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Emperor Otto I</a> (936-73). But when Giselbert was drowned near Andernach in 933, during his flight from the loyal Counts Udo and Conrad, Otto once more obtained the upper hand and gave Lorraine to his brother Henry. The latter was driven out by the people of Lorraine, and Otto made Count Otto of <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, son of Richwin, duke. In 943 he constrained Louis IV of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to make a final renunciation of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the Carlovingians over Lorraine. After Count Otto's death (944), the lordship passed to Count Conrad the Red of Franconia, who had married the emperor's daughter Liutgarde. But Conrad, too, was faithless, and, while <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> was absent on an expedition to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (953), he called in the Hungarians. He was deposed, however, and replaced by <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> (953-65).



<p>Bruno was the first to succeed in placing German supremacy on the firm basis which lasted until the twelfth century. This he accomplished by training an austere and learned <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, whom he deeply imbued with the national sentiment to such an extent that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> whom he appointed (such as Heino of <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, Adalbero of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, Hegelo and Bruno of Toul, Wazo of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>) became the principal supports of the imperial power. In order to control its continual unrest, he divided the country. The northern part (Lower Lorraine), from the Ardennes to the sea, comprised the Archbishopric of Cologne with the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> and <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>. The southern part, Upper Lorraine, or the Land of the Moselle, extended to the south-east of the Vosges and to the Sichelberg, with the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, Toul, and <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>. Subject to the supreme direction of Bruno, Lower Lorraine was assigned to Count Gottfried, Upper Lorraine to Count Friedrich, brother of Bishop Adalbero of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>. The German Emperor exercised suzerainty over both. Aachen became the capital in 965.
<h2 id="section2">Lower Lorraine</h2>

<p>The history of Lower Lorraine is connected with that of Upper Lorraine for only a few more centuries. In 977 Emperor <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> granted it to Charles, brother of Lothair of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, as a German fief. Lothair's subsequent invasion was repelled by Otto's famous march to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (978). After Charles's son Otto had died childless, the dukedom passed to Godfrey of <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, whose son Gozelo I reunited the upper and lower duchies under his rule in 1033. Of his sons, the elder, Godfrey the Bearded, succeeded him in Upper Lorraine and Gozelo II (d. 1046) in Lower Lorraine. After the latter's death, Lower Lorraine was conferred upon Count Frederick of Luxemburg and, immediately after, upon Godfrey the Bearded (1065-69). His son Godfrey the Hunchback was the last ruler of this district who was loyal to the empire. As the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, after the triumph of the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> Reform and the struggle over investitures, ceased to support the German emperors, the province soon resolved itself into small <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> estates. These gradually withdrew from the German allegiance. Part of the country became known as the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, or Low Countries, and in 1214 reverted finally to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, whilst the remainder took the name of Brabant. Godfrey adopted his nephew <a href="../cathen/06624b.htm">Godfrey de Bouillon</a>, who was enfeoffed in 1088 by Henry IV. Upon his death at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> Henry V gave the duchy to Godfrey the Bearded, Count of Brabant. In 1155 the Lords of <a href="../cathen/09260a.htm">Limburg</a> severed themselves from Lower Lorraine and became independent dukes. After Henry V (1186-1235) the dukes of Lower Lorraine were known as dukes of Brabant. In 1404 the duchy was united to <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>.
<h2 id="section3">Upper Lorraine</h2>

<p>After Lower Lorraine received the name of Brabant, Upper Lorraine became known simply as Lorraine. The latter was split up among numerous small countships and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, Toul, and Verdun, which from early times had been immediate fiefs of the empire. The history of these <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> in Lorraine, Metz being the centre and head of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization. The larger, southern, half was under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the See of Toul. The <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> was conferred by <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Emperor Henry III</a>, in 1048, upon the wealthy Count Gerhard of Alsace, whose descendants reigned there for seven hundred years. Under <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Emperor Otto I</a> the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were reformed by Bishop Albero I (928-63). Stephen, of the powerful house of Bar, Bishop and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> 1120-63, brought the newly-founded <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> and <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Orders into the country. Complete political rest never really existed. When not repelling the attacks of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Lorraine was occupied with intestine <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, either among the spiritual principalities mentioned above or among the Counts of Bar, Bitsch, Vaudemont, and other temporal lords. Besides, the dukes were, as a rule, involved in the quarrels of the German suzerain and also took part in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>; for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and devotion to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> distinguished most of them, in spite of their warlike character.

<p>Duke Theobald II (1304-12) at a meeting of the Diet settled the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of inheritance upon his <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> as well as male descendants. Isabella, daughter of Charles I, accordingly mounted the throne in 1431, and, with her, her consort Ren&eacute; of Anjou and Bar, who brought the last-named duchy to Lorraine. When this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> line became extinct in 1473 the male line of Vaudemont succeeded under Ren&eacute; II (1473-1508). He successfully defended his country against Charles the Bold of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> (1477), and to his maternal inheritance of Lorraine, Bar, Pont-&agrave;-Mousson, and <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guise</a> he united the dignities received from his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>--Vaudemont, Joinville, Aumale, Mayenne, and Elb&aelig;uf--and kept up Anjou's pretensions to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. Ren&eacute; II, by forcing the election of his uncle Henry II as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1484, brought the administration of the <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">See of Metz</a> to the House of Lorraine, and Bishop John IV of Vaudemont (1518-43 and 1548-50), as <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Lorraine and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> for that country, united in his own hands Bar and the principalities of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, Toul, and Verdun, the episcopal power over Toul, Terouanne, Narbonne, Die-Valence, <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, <a href="../cathen/09413a.htm">Lu&ccedil;on</a>, <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, Alby, <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/01209b.htm">Agen</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>; and was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Goze, F&eacute;camp, Cluny, Marmoutier, Saint-Ouen, and Saint-Mansuy.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, after being forcibly averted by Duke Anton (1508-44), obtained a transitory foothold only in a few of the eastern districts, and in the seventeenth century it was constrained to give way entirely to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. In 1552 the great French encroachments recommenced, when Henry II, as the ally of the German <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes, annexed Metz, Toul, and Verdun, and Lorraine itself was occupied until 1559. At that time the spiritual life received a new stimulus under Bishop Henry III of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> (1612- 52) through the erection of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> at Saint-Barbe; <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> at <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>; Minims at Dieuze, Nomeny, and Bassing; <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> at Vic, Diedenhofen, Saarburg, and Bitsch; and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> houses at <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> and Buckenheim. <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> interested himself in the districts which suffered so severely in the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a>. By the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, in 1648, <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, Toul, and Verdun were formally ceded to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, which had re-occupied the Duchy of Lorraine in 1632, and by the Treaty of 1661 territory was ceded to <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, which thus secured to him a passage across Lorraine to Alsace. In 1697, by the Peace of Ryswick, he gave the duchy to Duke Leopold Joseph (1697-1729). In 1738, by the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, it was granted to the former King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, Stanislaus Leczinski, after whose death in 1766 it reverted to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> a series of changes took place. In 1598 Duke Charles had tried to erect a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> at <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a> for his duchy; but in 1602 only a collegiate chapter was established there. In 1778 the episcopal <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">See of Nancy</a> was really founded, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> received the title of <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Lorraine. At the same period the See of Saint-Die was founded, while that of Toul was abolished in 1790. By the division of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> into departments, in 1790, the &quot;Province of the Three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a>&quot;, as it had been known since 1552, with the Provinces of Lorraine and Bar, were divided into the departments of Moselle, Meurthe, Vosges, and Meuse. The jurisdictions of Saarwerden, Herbitzheim, and Diemeringen, for the most part <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, became incorporated with the departments of the Lower Rhine in 1793.
<h2 id="section4">After 1871</h2>

<p>By the Peace of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, 10 May, 1871, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to cede to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> from this Province the Department of Meurthe and the arrondissements of Saarburg and Chateau Salins. The German Lorraine of today comprises, of the old province of that name: Metz, with the Pays Messin, the temporal possessions of the old Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>; parts of the Duchy of Luxemburg; parts of the upper Rhine district; the former imperial Margravates of Pont-&agrave;-Mousson and Nomency; the imperial Principalities of Pfalzburg and Lixheim; half of the Countship of Salm; the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Abbey of Gorze; the Lordship of Bitsch; further, the royal fiefs acquired from the <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">See of Metz</a>; Blamont, Saarburg, Saareck, Saaralben, Homburg, etc. In order to bring the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> into harmony with the political boundaries, <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>, in 1874, surrendered eighty-three <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the district of Ch&acirc;teau-Salins and one hundred and four of the Saarburg district (aggregating 106,027 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>) to the <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Diocese of Metz</a>. In 1871 the new limits of Lorraine included 451,633 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 13,407 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, 176 other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and 529 who profess other <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>.
