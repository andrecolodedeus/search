<h1>Lorsch Abbey</h1>  

<p>(<em>Laureshamense Monasterium</em>, called also <em>Laurissa</em> and <em>Lauresham</em>).

<p>One of the most renowned <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the old Franco-German Empire, is situated about ten miles east of Worms in the Grand Duch of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. This <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was founded in 764 by Count Cancor and his <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowed</a> mother Williswinda. Having built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on their estate, Laurissa, they entrusted its government to the care of Chrodegang, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>. This well-known and saintly <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> dedicated the church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in honor of St. Peter the Apostle, and became its first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> founders enriched the new <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> by further donations. In 766 Chrodegang resigned the office of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> owing to his other important <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>. He then sent his brother Gundeland to Lorsch as his successor, with fourteen <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. To make the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> popular as a shrine and a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, Chrodegang obtained from <a href="../cathen/11577a.htm">Pope Paul I</a> the body of <a href="../cathen/10727b.htm">St. Nazarius</a>, who with three other Roman soldiers had won the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>. On 11 July, 765, the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">sacred relics</a> arrived, and were with great solemnity deposited in the basilica of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and basilica were then named in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/10727b.htm">St. Nazarius</a>, instead of St. Peter as heretofore. Many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought through the intercession of <a href="../cathen/10727b.htm">St. Nazarius</a>, and from all parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> in large numbers came to visit the shrine. Having grown into prominence as a nursery of learning and culture, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> became no less celebrated as a centre of virtue and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Popes and emperors repeatedly favoured the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> with special privileges. The transfer of many estates and the addition of small towns to its possessions soon raised the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> to the position of a principality, so that in a short time it became not only immensely rich, but also a seat of political influence.

<p>It was, however, this very influence of its wealth and political ascendancy that caused its decline and final ruin. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, enjoying state <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, became implicated in several local feuds and in a number of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. After forty-six <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of the Order of St. Benedict had governed the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> more or less successfully, Conrad, the last of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, was deposed by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Pope Gregory IX</a> in 1226, and through the influence of the German <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a>, Lorsch came into the possession of Archbishop Siegfried III of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. In 1248 <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were given charge of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> with the sanction of <a href="../cathen/03479a.htm">Pope Celestine IV</a>, and they remained there till 1556, when, after a glorious existence of 800 years, Lorsch and the surrounding country passed into the hands of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> and <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> princes. The princes allowed the religious a pension for life, and then sent them adrift in the world. In Lorsch itself, first the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>, and later the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> religion was introduced. During the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> Lorsch and its neighbourhood suffered greatly, but, having again come into the possession of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, it returned to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. The most dreary period for Lorsch was during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> from 1679 and 1697. Whole villages were laid in ruins, the homes of the peasantry were destroyed by fire, and the French soldiers burned the old buildings whose associations had made them sacred to the inhabitants. One portion, which was left intact, now serves as a tobacco warehouse. The ancient entrance hall, built in the ninth century by Emperor Ludwig III, is the oldest and probably the most beautiful monument of Franconian architecture. This hall, though the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the Grand Duchy of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, is now used as a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> where Mass is occasionally celebrated.
