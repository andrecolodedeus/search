<h1>Louis-Antoine de Noailles</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, b. at the Ch&#226;teau of Teyssi&eacute;re in Auvergne, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 27 May, 1651; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 4 May, 1729. His father, first Duc de Noailles, was captain- general of Roussillon; his mother, Louise Boyer, had been lady-in-waiting to Queen Anne of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Louis de Noailles studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in the Coll&#232;ge du Plessis, where <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> was his fellow-student and friend, and obtained his doctorate at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, 14 March, 1676. Already provided with the Abbey of Aubrac (<a href="../cathen/13107a.htm">Diocese of Rodez</a>), he was, in March, 1679, appointed to the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a>, and in 1680 transferred to Ch&#226;lons-sur-Marne, to which see a peerage was attached. He accepted this rapid removal only at the formal command of <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>. In this office he showed himself a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, occupying himself in all kinds of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>. He confided his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, and founded a <em>petit s&eacute;minaire.</em>

<p>The regularity of his conduct, his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> standing, and the support of <a href="../cathen/09548b.htm">Mme de Maintenon</a> induced <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> to make him <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 19 August, 1695. At <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> he was what he had been at Ch&#226;lons. Lacking in brilliant qualities, he was possessed of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and activity. He was simple in manners and accessible to poor and rich alike. In 1709 he sold his silver plate to provide food for the famine-stricken. His generosity towards churches was also remarkable, and he spent large sums from his private fortune in decorating and improving Notre-Dame. The decorum of public worship and the good conduct of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were the particular objects of his care. Inspired more by customs prevalent in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> than by the prescriptions of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, he caused the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> already published by his predecessor de Harlay, to be reprinted. To these he added the Rituale, the Ceremoniale, and a collection of canons for the use of his Church. By decrees issued on his accession (June, 1696) he imposed for the first time on aspirants to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a> the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of residing in <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> for several months before <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. He organized ecclesiastical conferences throughout his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and conferences in <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> once a week at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to make an annual retreat, wise rules were drawn up for the good conduct and regularity of all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, the Divine service, the assistance of the sick, and the primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Seminaries for poor <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> were encouraged and supported, and one was founded which served as a shelter for poor, old, or infirm <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p>While still <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ch&#226;lons he took part in the conferences held at Issy to examine the works of <a href="../cathen/07092b.htm">Mme Guyon</a>. His part was only secondary, but he succeeded in having the accused's entire defence heard. Shortly afterwards he became involved in a controversy with <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> concerning the latter's "Maximes des Saints," which was condemned by the Bishops of Meaux, <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, and de Noailles himself. In 1700 he was made a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a>. Several months later de Noailles presided at the General Assembly of the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. This assembly exerted great influence on the teaching of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and after <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> no one had so great a share as de Noailles in its decisions. He became <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Navarre in 1704, head of the Sorbonne in 1710, and honorary dean of the faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Except for his attitude towards <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> career would be deserving only of praise. He always denied being a <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a>, and condemned the five propositions constituting the essence of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, but he always inclined, both in <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, to opinions savouring of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>; he favoured its partisans and was ever hostile to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the adversaries of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>. Shortly before his elevation to the See of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> he had approved (June 1695) the "R&eacute;flexions morales" of P&#232;re <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>, an Oratorian already known for his ardent attachment to <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> and destined soon to be its leader. He earnestly recommended it to his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. This <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> was the source of all the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> troubles.

<p>Believing themselves thenceforth certain of his sympathy the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, on de Noailles' elevation to the See of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, published a posthumous work of <a href="../cathen/02292b.htm">de Barcos</a>, entitled "Exposition de la foy", really the explanation and defence of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of grace already condemned by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. De Noailles condemned the book (20 August, 1696), at least in the first part of his instruction, but in the second he set forth a theory on grace and <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> closely resembling that of <a href="../cathen/02292b.htm">de Barcos</a>. No one was satisfied; the ordinance displeased both the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. The former did not fail to call attention to the contradictory attitudes of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ch&#226;lons, who approved <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, who condemned <a href="../cathen/02292b.htm">de Barcos</a>. An anonymous pamphlet published under the title "Probl&#232;me eccl&eacute;siastique", placed side by side twenty-nine identical propositions which had been approved in the <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel's</a> work and condemned in <a href="../cathen/02292b.htm">de Barcos</a>. Parliament condemned the lampoon to be burned; six months later it was put on the Index (2 June, 1699) and proscribed by the Holy Office.

<p>The controversies occasioned by the publication of the "Casde Conscience" and <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel's</a> "R&eacute;flexions morales" (for which see <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">J<font size=-2>ANSENIUS</font></a>, in Vol. VIII, 291-2) involved de Noailles deeply in the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> quarrel. In spite of repeated <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decisions of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, for many years, would not accept the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>. Finally he yielded in May, 1728, and on 11 October following published his unconditioned acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. He afterwards retracted various writings, which seemed to cast <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> on the sincerity of his submission; he restored to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> the faculties of which he had deprived them thirteen years before. He died two months later, aged 78, regarded by all with respect and esteem. His weak and uncertain character <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to offend everybody &#151; <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and king, partisans and adversaries of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>. He lacked discernment in the choice of his confidants; he bore a great name, and played an important part in his time, but lacked many qualities of a great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. His works &#151; <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> ordinances and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> instructions &#151; are mostly collected in the "Synodicon ecclesi&aelig; Parisiensis" (Paris, 1777).
