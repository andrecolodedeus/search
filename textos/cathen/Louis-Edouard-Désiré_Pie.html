<h1>Louis-Edouard-D&eacute;sir&eacute; Pie</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, born at Pontgouin, <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Diocese of Chartres</a>, 1815; died at <a href="../cathen/01513b.htm">Angoul&ecirc;me</a>, 1880. He studied at the Seminary of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> and at St. Sulpice, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> 1839, became <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, 1844, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> 1849. He created many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, established in his Seminary a canonical faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, founded for the missions of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> the Oblates of St. Hilary and brought the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to Poitiers and the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> to <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">Solesmes</a> and Ligug&eacute;. To his initiative were largely due the resumption of the <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the promotion of St. Hilary's cultus and the erection of the national shrine of the Sacred Heart at Montmartre. He is however, best known for his opposition to modern <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, and his championship of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Regarding as futile the compromises accepted by other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> leaders, he fought alike all <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> theories and political arrangements that did not come up to the full traditional <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> standard. His stand in matters <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> was indicated as early as 1854-55 in two synodal instructions against "the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the present day and of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>".

<p>In politics a staunch follower of the Comte de Chambord, he trusted but little the other regimes under which he lived. To <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a> who had declared untimely certain measures suggested by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Pie said one day: "Sire, since the time has not come for Christ to reign, then the time has not come for government to last". Such was the vigour with which he stigmatized the imperial insincerity regarding the independence of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a> that he was denounced to both the Council of State and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The former pronounced him guilty of abuse of power, but <a href="../cathen/01583d.htm">Cardinal Antonelli</a> valiantly stood by him. At the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> he did not sign the <em><a href="../cathen/12319c.htm">postulation</a></em> petitioning for the definition of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibilty</a>, but once it was placed on the programme of the council, he <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> one of the best exponents and defenders of it. As a reward for his loyal services, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> made him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, 1879. Sincerely attached to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, Mgr. Pie had refused all offers of preferment: a seat at the national Assembly, the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, and even the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> See of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. His works, full of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and <a href="../cathen/03588e.htm">unction</a>, were published serially during his lifetime at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, but were later collected into "Oeuvres &eacute;piscopales", 10 vols., Paris, s.d., and "Oeuvres sacerdotales", 2 vols., Paris, s.d.
