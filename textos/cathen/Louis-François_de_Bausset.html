<h1>Louis-Fran&ccedil;ois de Bausset</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, writers, and statesman, b. in 1748 at Pondichery, where his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> held an administrative position; d. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1824. He studied in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> "College de la Fleche" and at St. Sulpice. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he became <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> at <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a> in 1772; administrator of <a href="../cathen/04793a.htm">Digne</a>, 1778; <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Alais, in Languedoc, 1784. Although a prominent member of the Assembly of Notables of Languedoc in 1786 and in 1788, he was not <a href="../cathen/04696b.htm">delegated</a> to the Etats Generaux of 1789. In 1791, Bausset was one of the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who endorsed the "Exposition of Principles on the Civil Constitution of the Clergy". He declined to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> and passed to <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. Returning to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1792, he was incarcerated, but set free when Robespierre fell (9 Thermidor). He then returned to Villemoison, where he began his literary career. After the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a> Bausset cheerfully resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> into the hands of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>. Ill health prevented his appointment to one of the newly-formed sees, but <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> made him a canon of St. Denis (1806) and a member of the council of the University of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1808). Under the Restoration, he became president of the University council and peer of the realm (1815); Member of the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a> (1816); <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> (1817), and Minister of State (1821). The valuable <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of Bausset were bequeathed to St. Sulpice.

<p>The career of Bausset as educator and statesman deserves no special notice; he was guided by, more than he guided, the policy of the two regimes under which he served. From his pen we have, besides several minor writings, "Expos&eacute; des principes sur le serment", with a long introduction by Emery (Paris, 1796); "Notices historiques" on Cardinal Boisgelin Talleyrand (Paris, 1821); two considerable biographies: "Histoire de F&eacute;nelon" (Versailles, 1809; Paris, 1823; ed. <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, 1826) and "Histoire de J.-B. Bossuet, &eacute;v&ecirc;que de Meaux" (Paris, 1814, 1819; Versailles, 1821; Besan&ccedil;on, 1847). The original documents concerning <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> he had from the Abb&eacute; Emery, Superior of Saint-Sulpice. <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet's</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, not yet purchased by the National Library, he borrowed from Lamy, a bookseller into whose hands they had fallen. The purity of his style won for Bausset the decennial prize awarded by the Institute of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to the best biography. Still, that very purity often passes into a tiresome sameness which fails to suggest either the winning qualities of <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon's</a> character or the elevation of the Eagle of Meaux. As a historian, Bausset fails in critical acumen and judicial impartiality. His "Histoire de F&eacute;nelon" is so much of a panegyric that, especially in the delicate and intricate question of the <a href="../cathen/12608c.htm">Quietist movement</a>, it needs to be supplemented and corrected by such works as those of Griveau and of Crousl&eacute;. It is said that the "Histoirede Bossuet" was written as an offset against the partiality which Bausset had shown to <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a>; if so, Bausset had a strange way of rehabilitating the subject of his second biography, praising <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet's</a> Gallicanism as <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> himself, tormented in his last years by the "Defensio cleri gallicani", would not have wished it praised. <a href="../cathen/03010a.htm">Bruneti&egrave;re</a> calls Bausset's "Histoire of Bossuet" "la plus franchement gallicane de toutes".
