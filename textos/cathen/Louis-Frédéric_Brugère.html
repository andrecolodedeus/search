<h1>Louis-Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Brug&egrave;re</h1>  

<p>Professor of <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a> and <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, 8 October 1823; died at Issy, 11 April, 1888. He studied with the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> at St. Euverte, and at the Petit S&eacute;minaire of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>. His poem of 300 lines describing an inundation of the Rhone and composed in 1841, was printed and sold for the benefit of the flood victims at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. He entered the Grand seminaire of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> in 1841 and the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> seminaire 1845, where he received the degrees of Bachelor of Licentiate, and Doctor. From 1846 to 1861 with the exception of two years spent as assistant in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Aignan, Brug&egrave;re taught the classics and philosophy in the Orl&eacute;ans <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> college of La Chapelle-saint-Mesmin. In 1862 he entered the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of Saint-Sulpice and was appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> where, in 1868, he occupied the chair of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> in addition to his other labours.

<p>Brug&egrave;re's teaching was characterized by rare tact and discernment. It was his conviction that, in order to assist in the establishment of communication between the naturally darkened mind and the radiance of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> must consider the individual <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> attitude of those whom he would direct. Thus he was a strong advocate of the <em>methodus ascendens ab intrinseco</em>, which was introduced towards the end of the fifteenth century, and which holds that the <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> should first arouse interest by setting forth the needy condition of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, with its problems unsolved and its cravings unsatisfied; then gradually suggest the unchanging organization which offers satisfaction and peace. Curiosity and interest thus intensified, and the admirable adjustment of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> to the needs of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> once recognized, fairmindedness urging further research, the honest inquirer will learn how moral certitude, though differing from metaphysical and physical certitude, is nevertheless <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> certitude, excluding all reasonable fear of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and is not to be confounded with probability, however great. Thus, only when prepared to recognize in the genuine <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> the credentials of the Divinity, may this inquirer be conducted back through history, from fulfilment to prediction, in the hope of discovering, by well authenticated <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, that the Almighty has stamped as His own the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> preserved, defended, and explained by His one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church.

<p>Such, in brief outline, is the method advocated in "De Ver&acirc; Religione" and "De Ecclesia", two treatises which Brug&egrave;re published in 1873, and which, from their adaptability to the needs of the day, merited the approval of competent judges. In addition to these treatises, Brug&egrave;re published "Tableau de l'histoire et de la litt&eacute;rature de l'&Eacute;glise". But it is chiefly as a professor that Brug&egrave;re is remembered. Gitfted with a remarkable memory, his mind was a storehouse of exact information which he freely imparted, embellishing it with anecdote and illustration, so that students gladly sought him out for pleasure and profit
