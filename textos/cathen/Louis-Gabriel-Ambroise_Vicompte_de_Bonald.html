<h1>Louis-Gabriel-Ambroise, Vicompte de Bonald</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> statesman, writer, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, b. at Monna, near Millau, in Rouergue (Aveyron) 2 October, 1754; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 23 November, 1840. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> at the College of Juilly; joined the king's musketeers, returned to his own province in 1776, was elected mayor of Millau in 1785, and in 1790 was chosen member of the departmental Assembly for Aveyron. He resigned in 1781, <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a>, became a soldier in the army of Cond&eacute;, and, when the army was disbanded, retired to Heidelberg, where he took charge of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of his two elder sons.

<p>Bonald published at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, in 1797, his first work: "Th&eacute;orie du pouvoir politique et religieux", which was suppressed in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by order of the Directory. In 1797 Bonald returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> under the name of Saint-S&eacute;verin, and published "Essai analytique sur les lois naturelles de l'ordre social" (1800); "Du divorce" (1801); and "La l&eacute;gislation primitive" (1802). He also collaborated with <a href="../cathen/03640a.htm">Chateaubriand</a> and others in the "Mercurede France", contributing several articles which were published in book form with other studies in 1819 under the title "M&eacute;langes litt&eacute;raires, politiques, et philosophiques". In 1808 he declined to be a member of the Council of the University, but finally accepted in 1810. He refused to take charge of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the son of Louis Bonaparte, King of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and of the King of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the son of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a>.

<p>A monarchist and royalist by nature and by principles, Bonald welcomed the restoration of the Bourbons. He was appointed a member of the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">Academy</a> by royal decree in 1816. From 1815 to 1822 he served as deputy from Aveyron, and in 1823 became a peer of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He then directed his efforts against all attempts at <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">liberalism</a> in religion and politics. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> against <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> was proposed by him in 1815 and passed in 1816. He took a prominent part in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1822 which did away with the liberty of the press and established a committee of censure of which he was the president. In 1815 he published his "R&eacute;flexions sur l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de l'Europe"; in 1817, "Pens&eacute;es sur divers sujets" in 2 vols. 8 vo. (2d., Paris, 1887); in 1818 "Recherches philosophiques sur les premiers objets des connaisances morales"; in 1827, "D&eacute;monstration philosophique du principe constitutif des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s". Meanwhile he collaborated with <a href="../cathen/03640a.htm">Chateaubriand</a>, <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02517a.htm">Berryer</a>, in the "Conservateur", and later in the "D&eacute;fenseur" founded by <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a>. In 1830 he gave up his peerage and led a life of retirement in his native city. &mdash; "There is not to be found in the long career", says Jules Simon, "one action which is not consistent with his principles, one expression which belies them."
