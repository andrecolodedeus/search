<h1>Louis-Guillaume-Valentin Dubourg</h1>  

<p>Second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> and the Floridas, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&#231;on</a>, b. at Cap Fran&#231;ois, <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>, 16 February, 1766; d. at <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&#231;on</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 12 December, 1833. His <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies were made at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1788 and entered the Company of Saint Sulpice. He was superior of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Issy when the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> broke out, and retired at first to <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>. In 1794 he <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> where he was welcomed by Bishop Carroll. He was president of <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown College</a> from 1796 to 1799. After an unsuccessful trip to Havana where he attempted to open a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, he returned to Baltimore and became the first superior of Saint Mary's College.

<p>On 18 August, 1812, he was appointed Apostolic Administrator of the <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Diocese of Louisiana</a> and the Floridas to succeed Bishop Pe&ntilde;alvar y Cardenas promoted (1801) to the <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">archiepiscopal See of Guatemala</a>. The position was by no means an easy one and Father Dubourg was forced, at the beginning of his administration to take up his residence outside <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>. However, he gradually overcame his opponents. On 28 January, 1815, on the threshold of the <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, he bestowed on General Jackson the laurels of victory.

<p>After settling in a satisfactory way the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> Father Dubourg proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> and the Floridas, 24 September, 1815. He returned to America in 1817 and took up his residence in St. Louis where he founded a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and college at "The Barrens". He also founded the St. Louis Latin Academy which developed into the present well-known St. Louis University. The Religious of the Sacred Heart simultaneously opened their first American <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, St. Charles's Academy (1818), and soon after a second one at Florissant. These institutions gave a great impulse to religion in what was then known as Upper Louisiana. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> visited yearly the southern part of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and when Bishop Rosati was appointed his coadjutor, <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> became again his residence. In 1826 Bishop Dubourg went again to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. He was a brilliant and learned man, but was reluctant to enforce his authority against the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> trustees who continually opposed him; therefore he tendered his resignation of the See of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> (November, 1826), thinking that another incumbent would be more successful.

<p>He was not, however, allowed to live in retirement, but was transferred, 2 October, 1826, to the <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Diocese of Montauban</a>; then on 15 February, 1833, he was promoted to the <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">archiepiscopal See of Besan&#231;on</a>. Archbishop Dubourg was one of the first patrons and beneficiaries of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, but was not, as has been said, its founder. This <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was organized at a meeting held at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> by the Abb&eacute; Inglesi, Bishop Dubourg's <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, but the chief r&ocirc;le in its creation is due to a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/08323b.htm">Pauline-Marie Jaricot</a>.
