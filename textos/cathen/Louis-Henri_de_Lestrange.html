<h1>Louis-Henri de Lestrange</h1>  

<p>(In <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religion</a>, DOM AUGUSTINE)

<p>Born in 1754, in the Ch&acirc;teau de Colombier-le-Vieux, Ard&egrave;che, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; died at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 16 July, 1827. He was the fourteenth child of Louis-C&eacute;sar de Lestrange, officer in the household of King Louis XV, and Jeanne-Perrette de Lalor, daughter of an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> gentleman who had followed James II, King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1688. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1778, and was attached to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Saint-Sulpice. In 1780, Mgr de Pompignan, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Vienne, in Dauphin&eacute;, chose him for his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, with the ulterior determination of having him as his coadjutor with the right of future succession. This prospect of being made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> alarmed the Abb&eacute; de Lestrange, and in the same year he severed all the ties that bound him to the world, and entered the celebrated <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09035a.htm">La Trappe</a>. He was master of the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> in that <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, when a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the National Assembly, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 4 December, 1790, suppressed the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Dom Augustine with twenty-four religious left for <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, where the Senate of Fribourg authorized them to take up their residence in Val-Sainte, an ancient <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> about fifteen miles from the city of Fribourg. From Val-Sainte, Dom Augustine established foundations at Santa Susana in <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, at Mont Brac in <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, at Westmalle, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and at Lulworth, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In 1798 the French troops invaded <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave the country. Some of them settled at Kenty, near Cracow; others at Zydichin, in the Diocese of Lusko, and in Podolia. In 1802 <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> recalled them, and Dom Augustine took possession once more of Val-Sainte, and in the following year he sent a colony to America under Dom Urbain Guillet.

<p>In 1804 Dom Augustine founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Cervara in the Republic of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> not only authorized the establishment, but granted it a revenue of 10,000 francs. Moreover he desired that a similar institution be founded on the Alps, at Mont-Gen&egrave;vre, to serve as a refuge for the soldiers who were to pass to and fro between <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. To secure the success of this establishment he granted it an allowance of 24,000 francs. This protection was not, however, of long duration. The Republic of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> was united to the empire, and there, as in all the other states under the sway of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of fidelity to the empire was exacted from <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and religious. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> of Cervara, acting on the advice of some eminent personages, and of some influential members of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who assured them that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had allowed the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, took the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of fidelity. Dom Augustine, who had received from <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, then <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> at <a href="../cathen/13489c.htm">Savona</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> issued against the spoliator of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Holy See</a>, commanded the Prior of Cervara to make immediate retractation. The emperor became furious. He caused Dom Augustine to be arrested at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> and thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. At the same time, by a sweeping <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 28 July, he suppressed all the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappist</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> throughout the empire. The prefect of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, upon the entreaties of several of Dom Augustine's friends, gave him the limits of the city for his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> availed himself of the liberty thus accorded him to hasten the departure of his religious for America; he himself obtained from the police permission to go to Val-Sainte and Mont-Gen&egrave;vre, where his presence was required. Pursued again by the emperor, he crossed <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and arrived at Riga, whence he left for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and America.

<p>Dom Augustine arrived in New York in December, 1813. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had just abandoned a building which they had in that city, and which they had used for a classical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The edifice occupied the place where now stands St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue. Dom Augustine purchased the site for the sum of $10,000, and in 1814, on the downfall of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, Dom Augustine returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and took possession once more of his former <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09035a.htm">La Trappe</a>. But his trials were not ended. He was accused of imposing extraordinary hardships on his religious; he was reproached with his frequent voyages and long absences. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13681d.htm">S&eacute;ez</a>, in whose <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09035a.htm">La Trappe</a>, deceived by <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> insinuations, took the part of the <a href="../cathen/04757a.htm">detractors</a>, and claimed over the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> the authority of "direct superior". Dom Augustine, to put an end to these disputes with his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, abandoned La Trappe, and sought refuge at Bellefontaine, in the <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Diocese of Angers</a>. The complaints were carried to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and submitted to the Sacred Congregation of Bishops and Regulars. Dom Augustine was summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He returned justified, and loaded with favours by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Posterity has given Dom Augustine de Lestrange the title of "Saviour of La Trappe". His remains repose in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09035a.htm">La Trappe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13681d.htm">Diocese of S&eacute;ez</a> alongside those of Abbot de Ranc&eacute;.
