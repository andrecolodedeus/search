<h1>Louis-Siffren-Joseph Salamon</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13347b.htm">Saint-Flour</a>; b. at Carpentras, 22 Oct., 1759; d. at <a href="../cathen/13347b.htm">Saint-Flour</a>, 11 June, 1829. After studying <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/02160a.htm">Avignon</a>, at that time belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, he was made auditor of the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a> by the favour of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>. This office he resigned for a post in the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he took part in the famous case of the "Diamond Necklace" (1754), which Cardinal de Rohan had purchased for <a href="../cathen/09665a.htm">Marie Antoinette</a>. He continued to be a member until the Parliament was abolished (1790). Meanwhile he had kept up a correspondence with the cardinal secretary of State, informing him of all that passed in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and could be of interest to <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, Mgr Dugnani, left <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> towards the end of 1790, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appointed Salamon to be his internuncio at the Court of Louis XVI. His devotion to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> marked him out for <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and accordingly he was thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> at the time of the September massacres, 1792. Twice he narrowly escaped death. On his release he wandered about in disguise, acting as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. In 1801 Mgr Caprara arrived in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> and appointed him administrator general of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Normandy. The new pontiff, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, did not select him for one of the sees under the Concordat, but made him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Orthozia <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus</a></em>. It was not until after the Restoration that he received a French see at the suggestion of Louis XVIII (1820). His episcopate lasted only nine years, but these were full of work for the restoration of religion. The training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> especially engaged his attention, as he lamented the contrast between the cultured <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the old r&eacute;gime and those who were brought up during the confusion of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. His "M&eacute;moires" were discovered at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and published by Abb&eacute; Bridier ("M&eacute;moires in&eacute;dits de l'internonce &acirc; Paris pendant la R&eacute;volution", Paris, 1890). They have been translated by Frances Jackson ("A Papal Envoy during the Terror", London, 1911). His statements are sometimes at variance with established facts.
