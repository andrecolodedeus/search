<h1>Louis Baunard</h1>  

<p>Educator, b. at Bellgarde (Loiret), <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1828. He was one of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, until 1877, after which he was attached to the Catholic University of <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a>, first as professor, and later as <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>. No <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> profited more by the Law of 1875 that granted freedom of higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The transfer of the State University from <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> to Lille did not retard the progress of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institution. Guided by its <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, and supported by the active charity of the manufacturers of Northern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a> has graduated a great number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> physicians, lawyers, and business men. Many young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> also have been prepared at <a href="../cathen/09251a.htm">Lille</a> for the career of teaching, which they have since followed as professors in the <em>petits seminaires</em> and boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Technical courses exist for those who intend to devote themselves to manufacturing industries; a department of economics and the social <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> was established through the efforts of M. Duthoit for the development of the social principles of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>; finally the "university extension", a sort of popular circulating <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, provides for lectures by the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> professors in all the industrial centres of Northern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>Mgr. Baunard received the degree of Doctor of Letters, in 1860; in the two theses which he wrote he treated of the pedagogy of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and of Theodulphus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>; both works which marked the beginning of a literary activity surpassed by few. As hagiographer he wrote on <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Apostle</a> (1869) and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> (1871). He wrote the biographies of Louise de Marillae, the foundress of the Daughters of Charity (1898); of <a href="../cathen/02283a.htm">Madame Barat</a> (1876), foundress of the Ladies of the Sacred Heart; of Vicomte Armand de Melun (1880), Cardinal Pie, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> (1886), <a href="../cathen/09050d.htm">Cardinal Lavigerie</a> (1896), M. Ernest Leli&egrave;vre, founder of the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a> (1905), and M. Vrau, the great <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> manufacturer (1906). The French <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">religious history</a> of the nineteenth century was summarized by him in "un si&egrave;cle de l'Eglisede France" (1901). He contributed notable works of religious <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> in his celebrated books, "Le doute et ses victimes" (1865), in which the pages on Jouffroy were both new and surprising, and "La foi et ses victoires" (1881-83). Whatever his subject, Mgr. Baunard was always an "awakener of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>" by reason of his delicate literary conscientiousness and his admirable fecundity. His "Esp&eacute;rance" (1892) throws much light on the beginnings of the contemporary religious revival among intelligent <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a>; his "L'&eacute;vangile du pauvre" (1905) appeared opportunely during a period of social unrest. As <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, Mgr. Baunard occupies a foremost place in history of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> movement; as author, he collected much important material for the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">religious history</a> of modern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.
