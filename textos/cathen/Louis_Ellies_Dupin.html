<h1>Louis Ellies Dupin</h1>  

<p>(also DU PIN)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, born 17 June, 1657, of a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in Normandy; died 6 June, 1719. His mother, a Vitart, was the niece of Marie des Moulins, grandmother of the poet <a href="../cathen/12630b.htm">Jean Racine</a>. At the age of twenty Dupin accompanied <a href="../cathen/12630b.htm">Racine</a> who made a visit to Nicole for the purpose of becoming reconciled to the gentlemen of Port Royal. But, while not hostile to the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, Dupin's <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> attraction was in another direction; he was the disciple of Launoy, a learned critic and a Gallican. Dupin took his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, and received there the degree of bachelor in 1680, and of doctor in 1684.

<p>From the beginning of his studies he had accumulated notes on the works and teachings of the Fathers. In 1686 there appeared the first volume of the "Nouvelle biblioth&egrave;que des auteurs eccl&eacute;siastiques", covering the first three centuries. In it Dupin had treated simultaneously biography, literary criticism, and the history of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>; in this he was a pioneer leaving far behind him all previous efforts, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, which were still under the influence of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> method. He was also the first to publish such a collection in a modern language. Unfortunately he was young and worked rapidly. In this way <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> crept into his writings and his productions were <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> attacked. Mathieu Petit-Didier, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, published an anonymous volume of "Remarques sur la biblioth&egrave;que des auteurs eccl&eacute;siastiques de M. Du Pin" (Paris, 1691), and this was followed by two other volumes to which the author's name was appended (Paris, 1692 and 1696). Dupin answered him in his fifth volume and Petit-Didier replied in the fore part of his second volume of "Remarques". Petit-Didier's observations were often inspired by contemporaneous prejudice. Thus Dupin had placed in the fourth century, to which indeed he rightly belongs, <a href="../cathen/09482a.htm">St. Macarius</a> the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>. Petit-Didier discovered Semipelagianism in this author's works, in reality <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> professed by many before St. Augustine, but from which the adversary of Dupin concluded that Macarius should come after <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> and St. Augustine (II, 198).

<p>A more formidable enemy appeared in <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, who, during a public thesis at the College of Navarre in 1692, condemned the audacity of the critic. Dupin answered him and <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> appealed to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>, denouncing Dupin to Chancellor Boucherat and to Archbishop de Harlay. <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> simply enumerated the points that he disapproved in the "Biblioth&egrave;que" concerning <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, the canonicity of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell's</a> torments, the veneration of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and of their <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, the adoration of the Cross, grace, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy of the clergy</a>, tradition, the Eucharist, the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of the Trinity, and the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a>. He demanded a censure and a retractation.

<p>Like Petit-Didier <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> would not admit that any of the Greek or <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> differed from St. Augustine on the subject of grace, non that this matter could be called subtle, delicate, and abstract. Between Dupin and <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> there was a still wider difference." The liberty M. Dupin takes of so harshly condemning the greatest men of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should, in general, not be tolerated" (Bossuet, &OElig;uvres, XXX, 513). On the other hand <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> strongly contended that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> could not be too severely dealt with: "It is dangerous to call attention to passages that manifest the firmness of these people without also indicating wherein this firmness has been overrated: otherwise they are credited with a moral steadfastness which elicits sympathy and leads to their being excused" (op. cit., XXX, 633).

<p>Dupin submitted but was nevertheless condemned by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (14 April, 1696). He continued his "Biblioth&egrave;que", which was put on the Index long after his death (10 May, 1757), though other works of his were condemned at an earlier date. He had also to suffer the criticism of Richard Simon (Paris, 1730, 4 vols.). Simon and Dupin had similar views and methods so that when <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> was writing the "D&eacute;fense de la Tradition et des Saints P&egrave;res" (which did not appear, however, until 1743), he included both in his invectives against the "haughty critics" who inclined to rabbinism and the <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">errors of Socinus</a>. Although Dupin spoke favourably of Arnauld and signed the "Cas de conscience", he was not a <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a>. On these matters he rather shared the opinion of Launoy who "had found a way to be at once both <a href="../cathen/13703a.htm">demi-Pelagian</a> and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a>" (Bossuet, &OElig;uvres, XXX, 509). Dupin was pre-eminently a Gallican. It was probably on this account that <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> had him exiled to Ch&acirc;tellerault, on the occasion of the "Cas de conscience". Dupin retracted and returned, but his chair in the College of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was irretrievably lost. Later Dubois, who aspired to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> and sought therefore the favour of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, made similar accusations against Dupin. Dupin was on friendly terms with Wake, the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, who hoped for a union of the two Churches. The correspondence was looked on with suspicion, and in 1718 the regent had Dupin's papers seized. This act led to <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against the writer, who really had had no other aim than the reconciliation of the separated <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>. A similar purpose animated the "m&eacute;moires" he presented to Peter the Great during the latter's residence in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Dupin died shortly after.

<p>Besides the "Nouvelle biblioth&egrave;que eccl&eacute;siastique" (58 vols. 8vo with tables), the "Remarques" by Petit-Didier, and the "Critique" by R. Simon reprinted in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> (19 vols. 4to), Dupin edited the works of <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a> (Paris, 1703), Optatus of Mileve (Paris, 1700), the Psalms with annotations (1691), and published "Notes sur le Pentateuque" (1701), an abridgment of "L'histoire de l'&Eacute;glise" (1712), "L'histoire profane" (1714-1716), "L'histoire d'Apollonius de Tyane" (1705, under the name of M. de Clairac), a "Trait&eacute; de la puissance eccl&eacute;siastique et temporelle", a commentary on the Four Articles of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1707), the "Biblioth&egrave;que universelle des historiens" (1716), numerous works and articles on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, reprints of former works, etc. Dupin was no pedant. Etienne Jordan, a contemporary who saw him, said: the morning he would grow pale over books and in the afternoon over cards in the pleasant company of ladies. His <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and adjoining apartment were marvellously well kept."
