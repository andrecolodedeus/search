<h1>Louis Mor&eacute;ri</h1>  

<p>An encyclopaedist, b. at Bargemont in the <a href="../cathen/06269a.htm">Diocese of Fr&eacute;jus</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 25 March, 1643, d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 10 July, 1680. His grandfather Joseph Chatranet, a native of <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, had settled in Provence under Charles IX and taken the name of the village of Mor&eacute;ri, the seigniory of which he had acquired through marriage. Young Mor&eacute;ri studied humanities at Draguignan, rhetoric at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. During his stay in this city, he published several works, among them "Pratique de la perfection chretienne et religieuse" (1667), a translation from the Spanish of Alphonso Rodriguez's work. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, he preached in Lyons for five years with great success. It was about that time that he formed the design of publishing a dictionary that that would contain all the interesting data of history and mythology. In 1673 he was as appointed <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Gaillard de Longjumeau, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Apt, to whom he dedicated the first edition of his encyclopaedia. In 1675 he accompanied that <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> where he became acquainted with de Pomponne, who gave him employment in his offices. After the downfall of that minister in 1678, he returned to his studies, but overwork had undermined his constitution and he died of consumption in 1680.

<p>Mor&eacute;ri was a man of great erudition but, lacked taste and judgment. His name is connected with a work that can hardly be considered as his own after all the changes which it has undergone. Bayle, who intended to make up the deficiencies of Mor&eacute;ri's dictionary, said of it: "I share the opinion of Horace on those who lead the way. The first compilers of dictionaries made many <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, but they deserve a glory of which their successors ought never to deprive them. Mor&eacute;ri has given himself a great deal of trouble, has been useful to everybody, and has sufficient information to many. "Mor&eacute;ri's encyclopaedia appeared for the first time in Lyons in 1671, under the title: "Le grand Dictionnaire historique, ou melange curieux de l'histoire sacr&eacute;e et profane." It was defective in many respects and was greatly improved in later editions which appeared in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> or Amsterdam. The best edition is the twentieth and last, published at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1759.
