<h1>Louis de Rouvroy, Duc de Saint-Simon</h1>  

<p>Born 16 January, 1675; died in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 2 March, 1755. Having quitted the military service in 1702, he lived thereafter at the Court, becoming the friend of the Ducs de Chevreuse and de Beauvilliers, who, with <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a>, were interested in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, grandson of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>. At the death of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, he was named a member of the council of regency of the young king, Louis XV, and in 1721 was sent as ambassador to <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. When the Duke of Bourbon became minister, December, 1723, Saint-Simon went into retirement. It was principally between 1740 and 1746 that he wrote his celebrated "Memoirs". As a history of the reign of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> they are an extremely precious document. The edition with commentary by Boislisle, and of which twenty-two volumes have already appeared (1911), is an incomparable monument of learning. Saint-Simon aired his hatreds, which were bitter and numerous; he was an adversary of equality, which he described as "leprosy"; he dreamt of a kind of chamber of dukes and peers which would control and paralyze royal despotism, and allow the States-General to assemble every five years to present the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> remonstrances of the people.

<p>Whatever the historical value of the "Memoirs" may be, they are, by their sparkling wit, one of the most original monuments of French literature; and the "Parallele des trots premiers rois Bourbons", written by Saint-Simon in 1746, the year in which he finished the record of the reign of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, is an admirable piece of history. On all religious questions he should be read with great precaution. Very hostile to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and favorable to the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, he contributed greatly to the creation of legends concerning personages such as <a href="../cathen/09548b.htm">Mme de Maintenon</a> and Michel Le Tellier. These legends had a long existence. The reproach, historically <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, of having instigated the violent measures of persecutions against the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, which he hurled against Le Tellier, was all the more strange coming from his pen, since Saint-Simon himself, on the day following the death of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, was one of the most rabid in demanding of the regent severe measures against Le Tellier and other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Father Bliard has shown how much care is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in judging Saint-Simon's assertions regarding the religious questions of his day. The historian Emile Bourgeois, who can not be charged with prejudice in favor of religion, wrote in his turn, in 1905: "History has given up the habit, too hastily acquired, of pinning her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the word of Saint-Simon." And Bourgeois <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> how inaccurate were the statements of Saint-Simon by showing what use the latter made in his "Memoirs" of documents of the diplomatist Torcy.
