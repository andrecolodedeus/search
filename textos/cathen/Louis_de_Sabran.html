<h1>Louis de Sabran</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>; born in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1 March, 1652; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 22 Jan., 1732. His father, afterwards a marquis, was attached to the French embassy in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> during the Commonwealth, and piously visited the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> <a href="../cathen/04355c.htm">Corby</a> and <a href="../cathen/05183b.htm">Duckett</a> before their deaths. He married an English lady (a Goring?), and Louis was sent to the <a href="../cathen/11251a.htm">English college of St. Omer</a>, and entered among the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Distinguished for many talents, he became one of the royal <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> to King James II, in 1685, preached with great diligence and was engaged in controversy with William Sherlock, <a href="../cathen/04659a.htm">dean</a> of St. Paul's, and Edward Gee. On the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">Revolution</a> in 1688 he was first sent to Portsmouth with the infant Prince of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, and then became involved in many adventures. He was repeatedly seized by the mob and maltreated, but as often escaped, and finally managed to slip over to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He was subsequently appointed visitor of the Neopolitan <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and represented his province at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the congregation of 1693, when the case of <a href="../cathen/06635c.htm">Father Gonz&aacute;lez</a>* was discussed. In 1699 the Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> appointed him president of his episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which excited a furious attack from the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> party, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had to enforce order with soldiers. But once the crisis was past, Father Sabran's rule became perfectly successful, and in 1708 or 1709, he was made provincial. He then wrote to Father Metcalfe, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> in the North, about the progress of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, but his letter was intercepted, and was declared by some to portend that he intended to gain possession of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai College</a>, as he had done that of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>. A long-drawn and somewhat bitter controversy ensued. After his provincialship he became <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251a.htm">St. Omer</a> (1712-5), then <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a> at the <a href="../cathen/05472b.htm">English College, Rome</a>, till death. The titles of his controversial tracts, will be found in Sommervogel, and he is alleged to have written a paper "Artes Bajanae" about 1701 against <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>.
