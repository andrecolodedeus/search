<h1>Low Church</h1>  

<p>The name given to one of the three parties or <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> tendencies that prevail in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Established Church of England</a> and its daughter Churches, the correlatives being High Church and Broad Church. The last of these names is not a century old, but the other two came into use simultaneously at the beginning of the eighteenth century. Their invention was due to the controversies stirred up by William III's endeavour to undo the Act of Uniformity of 1662 and concede to the Dissenters all that they had demanded in the <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> Conference. Quite a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of pamphlets was carried on at the time in which the terms High Church and Low Church were bandied to and fro. To cite one witness out of many, Bishop Burnet, in his "History of his own Time" (VII, 347), writes: "From these disputes in Convocation divisions ran through the whole body of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and to fix them new names were found out. They were distinguished by the names of High and Low Church. All that treated the Dissenters with temper and moderation, and were for residing constantly at their cures&hellip;were represented as secret favourers of presbytery, and as disaffected to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and were called Low Churchmen. It was said that they were in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> only while the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and preferments were on its side, but that they were ready to give it up as soon as they saw a proper time for declaring themselves."

<p>Naturally the Low Churchmen resented an appellation with which this suggestion of unworthy motives was associated. Still the term has passed into general usage, nor, if we forget, as the world has forgotten, an implication which is by no means essential to it, can it be denied that it and its correlative indicate fairly well a root-difference which throughout their various stages has characterized the two parties. What is the nature of the visible Church? Is it a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> whose organization with its threefold ministry has been preordained by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and is therefore essential, or is it one in which this organization, though of Apostolic precedent, can be departed from without forfeiture of church status? The High Churchmen have always stood for the former of these alternatives, the Low Churchmen for the latter. Moreover, round these central positions more or less consequential convictions have gathered. The High Churchmen, in theory at least, emphasize the principle of church authority as the final court of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> appeal; whilst the Low Churchmen appeal rather to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, privately interpreted, as the decisive judge. The High Churchmen exalt <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">ecclesiastical tradition</a> as the voice of church authority, regard the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> as in some sense a sacrifice and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> as efficacious channels of grace, and they insist on rites and ceremonies as the appropriate expression of external worship. whilst the Low Churchmen are distrustful of what they call human traditions, regard the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> as a symbolic meal only, hold firmly that the grace of justification and sanctification is imparted to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> independently of visible channels, and dislike all rites and ceremonies, save those of the simplest kind, as tending to substitute an external formalism for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> inward devotion. In short, the one party attaches a higher, the other a lower degree of importance to the visible Church and its ordinances; and this may suffice to justify the retention of the names &#151; though it must always be borne in mind that they state extremes between which many intermediate grades of thought and feeling have always subsisted in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a>.

<p>Of the pre-Revolution period, although the two names were not as yet coined, it may be said that Low Church <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> were in the ascendant all through the reign of Elizabeth, but that under James I religious opinion began to grow high, until, mainly through the action of Archbishop Laud, it obtained a firm footing in the national Church; and, the lapse of the Rebellion notwithstanding, retained it throughout the Caroline period, and even through the reigns of William and Anne &#151; although William filled the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> with Low Church <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. With the advent of the <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanoverian</a> dynasty a deep spiritual lethargy settled down on the country. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> were now openly given as rewards for political service, the lesser <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> were mostly filled by pluralists of good <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. The chief solicitude of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was to lead comfortable lives, their highest spiritual effort, if such it could be called, taking the form of sermons on the reasonableness of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> directed against the <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deists</a>, or vapid laudations of moral <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Then, in the forties of the eighteenth century, there broke on this season of torpor an intense revival of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">religious fervour</a> which stirred the country to its foundations, and gave a new and much improved complexion to the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and spirit of the Low Church party. Now as before the appellation was resented, the adherents of the transformed party claiming to be called, as their descendants do still, Evangelicals. The name, however, has attached to them, and is applicable in so far as they share the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> about the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which has been described.

<p>The Evangelicals of the eighteenth century insisted that they were not introducing any new doctrines into their Church but only calling on people to take its doctrines to heart and apply them seriously to their lives. Still there were points of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> to which they gave a construction of their own, and on which they laid special stress. It is by these that their party is characterized. They insisted on the total depravity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> eyes as the consequence of the Fall; on the vicarious sacrifice of Christ as the substitute for fallen man; on the imputed righteousness of Christ as the sole formal cause of justification; on the necessity of a conscious conversion to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which must be preceeded by conviction of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (not of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> only), and which involves a species of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whereby the hand is, as it were, stretched out with firm assurance to appropriate the justification offered, the witness of the Spirit whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is interiorly certified that it is in a state of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and the commencement of a process of interior sanctification wrought in the heart by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, which in its earliest form is traceable to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, is in reality due to a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> analysis of some fundamental <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, and it is this intermixture of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which renders intelligible the rich harvest of edifying conversions and holy lives, chequered, however, by not infrequent instances of regrettable extravagances, which marked the beginnings of the new spiritual movement. The foremost name among its leaders was that of John Wesley, who, it must be remembered, if somewhat restive to its discipline, never himself forsook the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican communion</a>, though the main body of his followers did shortly after his death.

<p>But side by side with the Wesleys and Whitefield, the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> of that time had other leaders in whom the same species of spiritual impulse was active, but in whom it was kept freer from emotional excesses and manifested no tendency to stray off into separatism. It is these who must be recognized as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Fathers of the modern Low Church or Evangelical party. William Romaine may be regarded as their forerunner, but he was soon followed by Henry Venn of Huddersfield, John Newton of Olney, William Cowper, the poet, with their younger colleagues, Thomas Scott, the commentator, Joseph Milner, their historian, and Isaac Milner his brother, also Richard Cecil, their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> chief. These were the leaders in the second half of the eighteenth century. In the nineteenth century Bishop Handley Moule, their most distinguished representative at the present day, assigns three periods of Evangelical history. Of these the first lasted till about the middle of the century. He names it the period of Simeon and Wilberforce, after the cleric and the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> whose influence contributed the most of all to its progress and development. At the commencement of this period one remarkable feature was the gathering round Lord Teignmouth, Henry Thornton, and John Venn of the so-called "Clapham Sect". To this little group belonged also Zachary Macaulay, Josiah Pratt, James Stephen, and Sir Fowell Buxton. Though thus few in number, the effect of their intimate association with one another was seen in the important works to which their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> gave birth. They founded the "Christian Observer" (for three-quarters of a century, the organ of their party), of which Josiah Pratt and Zachary Macaulay were the first editors. They were mainly instrumental in founding the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Missionary Society in 1799, had much to do with the founding of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> Society in 1804, and collaborated actively, to their eternal credit, with Wilberforce and Henry Thornton in their successful crusade against the slave trade.

<p>His second period Bishop Moule names the Shaftesbury period, after the truly venerable nobleman who devoted his life to the protection and elevation of the poorer classes. He was a fervent Evangelical, and as a great <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> bore to the party something of the relation which William Wilberforce had borne to it in the earlier part of the century, its members in their turn co-operating with him energetically in his many charitable undertakings. Through his influence with Lord Palmerston he obtained the promotion of several conspicuous Evangelicals to posts of responsibility. Thus Villiers, Baring, Waldegrave, Wigram, and Pelham were promoted to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, and close to the deanery of <a href="../cathen/03349b.htm">Carlisle</a>. Other names of note during this period were John Bird Sumner, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, Edward Bickersteth, John Charles Ryle, Hugh McNeile, Hugh Stowell. This too was the flourishing period of the May meetings held annually at <a href="../cathen/05708a.htm">Exeter</a> Hall, and it was in 1876 that the Keswick conventions, which have since become annual events, were first commenced. His third period, to which he assigns the last two decades of the nineteenth century, Bishop Moule calls the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Missionary Society period, in view of the immense advances which that pet child of the party had made during recent years. As did Evangelicalism to the old Low Church <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, so has Tractarianism, which rose up in the middle of the nineteenth century, given a new interpretation to the old High Church views, which since then have been carried in the direction of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> far beyond what the old Caroline divines ever dreamt of. This movement has also struck root in the country, and has so extended itself that of late years people have begun to ask if the Evangelical party is not dying out. There are, indeed, appearances which may seem to point that way, but as an evidence to the contrary the Evangelicals may reasonably point to their Church Missionary Society, which is supported entirely by their contributions. Its annual income of late has fallen little short of &#163;400,000, which is more than double that of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> that comes next to it. Surely it is a fair inference from this impressive fact that Evangelicalism is still a living force of great power; and it must be added that, though this is not by any means its exclusive privilege, it can still as of old point to numberless bright examples of holy living among those who take its teaching to heart.
