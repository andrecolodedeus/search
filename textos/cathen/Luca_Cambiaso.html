<h1>Luca Cambiaso</h1>  

<p>(Also known as Luchetto da Genova, and as Luchino).

<p>Genoese <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, b. at Moneglia near <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, in 1527; d. in the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a>, <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 1585. He received his first instruction from his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, Giovanni Cambiaso, who is believed to have been the author of the method adopted in designing whereby the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body is divided into small squares in order to give correct proportions in foreshortening. Luca exhibited considerable talent, and was enabled by the assistance of a friend to visit Florence and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he carefully studied the works of <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>. His early <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> are somewhat extravagant and grotesque, but later in life he checked his impetuosity, and his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> were distinguished by exquisitely transparent colour and by grace in pose and composition. He was an exceedingly rapid <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, using both hands at once, and passionately fond of glowing colour and the sumptuous <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> backgrounds. In 1583 he was invited to visit <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where he was employed by Philip II in the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the ceiling of the choir and several <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-pieces</a>. His wife, to whom he was deeply attached, died in <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, and being unable to obtain a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marry</a> her sister, he gave way to severe disappointment, and allowed it to prey upon his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> until it produced melancholia, from which he died. He had one son, Orazio, who accompanied his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and who worked for Philip II after his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> decease.

<p>Cambiaso was a man of little historical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but as an artist was distinguished by accurate drawing, clever composition, and admirable colouring. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in his pictures are modest, the men impassioned, and he was fond of introducing horses into his scenes and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> them with beauty and spirit. His best works are in <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and Florence.
