<h1>Lucas Holstenius</h1>  

<p>(HOLSTE).

<p>German philologist, b. at <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, 1596; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 2 February, 1661. He studied at the gymnasium of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, and later at Leyden, where Vossius, Heinsius, Meursius, and Scriverius then taught. In 1618 Cluver induced him to accompany him on a journey to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, thus giving him a taste for the study of geography. He returned for a short time to Leyden, failed to be accepted as professor in the gymnasium of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, and went to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1622, where he gathered materials for his "Geographi Minores". At <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1624, he became librarian to the president de Mesmes, the friend of the scholarly brothers Dupuy, and the correspondent of Peiresc. At this time he was converted to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. The liking he had always displayed for <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> philosophy impelled him to read eagerly the Greek and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, especially those who treated of contemplative and <a href="../cathen/14621a.htm">mystical theology</a>. This led him quite naturally to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1627 he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and through the influence of Peiresc was admitted to the household of Cardinal Barberini, becoming his librarian in 1636. Finally, under <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a>, he was placed over the Vatican Library. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> sent him on various honorable missions, such as bearing the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat to the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a> (1629), receiving the <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a> of Queen Christina at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>, acting as intermediary in the conversion of the Landgrave of Darmstadt and of Ranzau, a <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> nobleman. Mostly, however, he was occupied with his studies. He had formed great projects; he desired to correct Cluver's <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and complete his work; to edit, translate and comment the works of the Neoplatonists; to form a collection of the unedited <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>; to collect inscriptions; to write a critical commentary on the Greek text of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>; to form a collection of all the monuments and acts of the history of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. These diverse undertakings consumed his energies and filled his notebooks, but without profit to scholarship. His notes and collations have been used by various editors. His principal works are an edition and a life of Porphyry (1630), the "Thoughts" of Democritus, Demophilus and Secundus, little mythological works (1638), an edition of Arrian's treatise on the Chase (1644), and the "Codex regularum monasticarum", a much used collection of monastic rules (1661; edited anew by Brockie, Ratisbon, 1759). He also edited for the first time the <a href="../cathen/09215c.htm">"Liber Diurnus"</a>, a collection of ancient chancery formulae used in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> (1660); this edition, however, was immediately suppressed by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> (see LIBER DIURNUS). After his death there were published from his papers collections of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> monuments, the "Collectio romana bipartita" (1662), also the acts of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> Perpetua and Felicitas, Boniface, Tarachus, Probus and Andronicus (1663). His observations on the geography of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> appeared in 1666, in the form of notes on the previously published works of Charles de Saint-Paul, Cluver and <a href="../cathen/11328b.htm">Ortelius</a>. The notes on Stephen of Byzantium were published at Leyden in 1684 by Rycke. <a href="../cathen/08756a.htm">Lambecius</a> was the nephew of Holstenius, but they quarrelled towards the end of his life.
