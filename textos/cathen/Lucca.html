<h1>Lucca</h1>  

<p>ARCHDIOCESE OF LUCCA (LUCENSIS).

<p>Lucca, the capital of the like named province in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, is situated on the River Serchio in a fertile cultivated plain. Its chief industries are the quarrying and dressing of marble, and the production of silk, wool, flax, and hemp. Its olive oil enjoys a world-wide fame. Noteworthy among the church buildings is the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which dates back to the sixth century; it was rebuilt in the Roman style in the eleventh century, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a> (1070), and again restored in the quattrocento, when the beautiful columns of the upper arches were added. In the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> are three large windows <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> by Ugolino da Pisa. Of the sculptural adornments we may mention Civitali's equestrian <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of St. Martin dividing his cloak with the beggar; the Deposition by <a href="../cathen/11047b.htm">Nicol&ograve; Pisano</a>, and the Adoration of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> by Giovanni da Pisa - all three on the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>. Within are pictures by Tintoretto and Parmigianino, and a Madonna by Fr&agrave; Bartolommeo. But the most celebrated work is the <em>Volto Santo</em>, an ancient crucifix carved in wood, with Christ clothed in the "colobium", a long sleeveless garment. Throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> this image was regarded as a palladium by the Lucchesi, who, on their journeys to every country, distributed facsimiles, thus giving rise to the legends of St. Liberata and St. Wilgefortis, of the "heilige Kummernis" of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> and the "Ontkommer" of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>; Professor Schn&uuml;rer of the <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">University of Fribourg</a> (Switzerland), has in preparation a study on this subject. San Frediano is the only example of Lombard architecture preserved without notable alteration, excepting the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>, which is of the year 1200. S. Maria foris Portam, S. Michele, S. Romano, and the other churches (fully eighty in number), all possess valuable works of art. In the church of S. Francesco (quattrocento) is the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the Lucchese poet, Guidiccioni. Among the profane edifices is the Palazzo Pubblico, formerly the ducal palace, begun by Ammanati in 1578, continued by Pini in 1729, and further enlarged by Prince Bacciochi in the nineteenth century; adjoining are the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, with many valuable <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and a picture gallery. The Manzi palace also contains a collection of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>. There is a magnificent aqueduct of 459 arches, constructed by Nattolini (1823-32). The archives of the capitol and the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace are important for their many private documents of the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Ruins of a Roman amphitheatre of imperial times still exist. The territory of Lucca is rich in mineral and thermal springs. The celebrated baths of Lucca are about fifteen miles from the city.

<p>Lucca was a city of the Ligurians, and is first mentioned in 218 B.C., when the Roman general Sempronius retired thither after an unsuccessful battle with Hannibal. In 177 B.C. a Roman colony was established there. In 56 B.C. C&aelig;sar, Pompey, and Crassus renewed the triumvirate at Lucca. During the Gothic <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> the city was besieged and taken by Totila (550). Hoping for assistance from the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, the Lucchesi obstinately resisted the attack of Narses, surrendering only after a siege of seven months (553). It later fell into the hands of the Lombards, was thenceforward a place of great importance, and became the favourite seat of the Marquesses of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. In 981 Otto bestowed on its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil jurisdiction</a> over the entire <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> territory; but in 1081 Henry IV made it a free city and conferred other favours upon it, especially in the way of trade. This was the origin of the Republic of Lucca, which lasted until 1799. From 1088 to 1144 Lucca was continually at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with her rival <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, and either by conquest or purchase increased her possessions. In 1160 the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> marquess finally surrendered all right of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Lucca was generally on the side of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> against the emperor, and hence joined the League of S. Ginesio (1197). In the thirteenth century, despite her <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and the imperial cities, Lucca increased her power and commerce. But in 1313 the city was taken by Uguccione della Faggiuola, Lord of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. The Lucchesi, however, under the most dramatic circumstances, freed themselves and chose for captain their fellow-citizen, Castruccio degli Antelminelli, known as Castracane (1316), the restorer of the military art, who had been <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by Uguccione. Castruccio drove out the <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a>, obtained for life the title of Defender of the People, and received from Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> the hereditary title of Duke of Lucca. His descendants, however, were deprived of the title by the same prince (1328-9). Castruccio adorned and fortified the city whose territory now extended from the Magra to Pistoia and <a href="../cathen/15504b.htm">Volterra</a>.

<p>On the death of Castruccio, Louis conferred Lucca on Francesco, a relative and enemy of Castruccio. The Lucchesi, however, placed themselves under John of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>; the latter, in 1333, pawned the city to the Rossi of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, who ceded it to Mastino della Scala (1335), by whom it was sold to the Florentines for 100,000 florins (1341). This displeased the <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a>, who occupied the city (1342). It was liberated by Charles IV (1360), who gave it an imperial vicar. From 1370 it was free. In 1400 Paolo Guinigi obtained the chief power, which he exercised with moderation and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. At the instigation of the Florentines, who sought possession of the city, Guinigi was betrayed into the hands of Filippo Maria Visconti (1430), who <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> at Pavia. With the aid of Piccinino, Lucca maintained her freedom against the Florentines. After that the security of this little state, governed by the people, was undisturbed except by the revolt of the <em>straccioni</em> (the lowest class) in 1521, and the conspiracy of Pietro Fatinelli (1542), who aspired to power. But in 1556 the Martinian law (Martino Bernardini) restricted participation in the government to the sons of citizens, and in 1628 this limitation was further accentuated, until in 1787 only eighty <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> enjoyed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to public office. Among the institutions of this republic the <em>discolato</em> deserves mention. It was similar to the ostracism of the Athenians. If a citizen, either through wealth or merit, obtained excessive favour among the people, twenty-five signatures were sufficient to banish him. In 1799 Lucca was joined to the Cisalpine Republic. In 1805 <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> made it a dukedom for his cousin Felice Bacciochi. In 1814 it was occupied by the Neapolitans, and later by the Austrians. In 1817 it was given to Maria Luisa, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of the King of Etruria, whose son Carlo Ludovico ceded it to <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> in 1847. Illustrious citizens of Lucca were Pope Lucius III (Allucingoli); the jurist, Bonagiunta Urbiciani (thirteenth century); the physician, Teodoro Borgognoni; the historian, Tolomeo de' Fiadoni; the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> poets, Laura Guidiccioni and Chiara Matraini; the philologist, L. Fornaciari (nineteenth century); the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, Berlinghieri and Orlandi (thirteenth century); the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, Matteo Civitali (first half of the fifteenth century).

<p>There is a legend that the Gospel was preached at Lucca by St. Paulinus, a disciple of St. Peter, and the discovery in 1197 of a stone, recording the deposition of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of Paulinus, a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, apparently confirmed this <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. On the stone, however, St. Paulinus is not called <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lucca, nor is there any allusion to his having lived in Apostolic times ("Analecta Bollandiana", 1904, p. 491; 1905, p. 502). The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of certain date is Maximus, present at the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> (343). At the <a href="../cathen/13057b.htm">Council of Rimini</a> (359), Paulinus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lucca, was present. Perhaps the above-mentioned legend arose through a repetition of this Paulinus. Remarkable for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> was St. Fridianus (560-88), son of Ultonius, King of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, or perhaps of a king of Ulster (<em>Ultonia</em>), of whom in his "Dialogues" (III, 10) <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> relates a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. On St. Fridianus see <a href="../cathen/04099c.htm">Colgan</a>, "Acta Sanct. Scot.", I (1645), 633-51; "Dict. Christ. Biog.", s.v.; Fanucchi, "Vita di San Frediano" (Lucca, 1870); <a href="../cathen/11224d.htm">O'Hanlon</a>, "Lives of Irish Saints", under 18 Nov.; "Analecta Bolland.", XI (1892), 262-3, and "Bolland. Bibl. hagiogr. lat." (1899), 476. In 739, during the episcopate of Walprandus, Richard, King of the Angles and father of Saints Willibald, Wunibald, and Walburga, died at Lucca and was buried in the church of S. Frediano. Under Blessed Giovanni (787) it is said the Volto Santo was brought to Lucca. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Anselmo Badagio (1073), later <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Pope Alexander II</a>, who was succeeded as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by his nephew <a href="../cathen/01550d.htm">Anselm of Lucca</a>, a noted write; Apizio (1227), under whom Lucca was deprived of its <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> for six years by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>; the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Giovanni Salvuzzi (1383), who built the episcopal palace; Nicol&ograve; Guinigi (1394), exiled by his relative Paolo Guinigi, Lord of Lucca. In 1408 <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> went to Lucca to come to a personal agreement with the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, and was there abandoned by his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. Worthy of mention also are the writer, Felino Maria Sandeo (1499), nephew of <a href="../cathen/01712b.htm">Ariosto</a>; <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinals</a> Sisto della Rovere (1508), Francesco Sforza Riario (1517), and Bartolommeo Guidiccioni (1605), under the last-named of whom the <a href="../cathen/13449c.htm">Diocese of San Miniato</a> was formed and separated from Lucca; Cardinal Girolamo Bonvisi (1657); Bernardino Guinigi (1723), the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> (1726); the learned Gian Domenico Mansi (1764-9); and finally the present <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Benedetto Lorenzelli (1904), last <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> before the separation. The Archdiocese of Lucca has no suffragans; it has 246 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with 230,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.
