<h1>Lucera</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF LUCERA (LUCERINENSIS).

<p>Lucera is a very ancient city in the province of <a href="../cathen/06123b.htm">Foggia</a> in Apulia, Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. It originally belonged to Daunia. In 320 B.C. it was taken by the Romans, a Roman colony being established there in 314. The Samnites defeated the Romans near Lucera in 294. During the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between Caesar and Pompey it was an important point of defence for the latter. In A.D. 663 it was captured from the Lombards and destroyed by Constantius II. Lucera attained great importance when <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> transferred thither the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> whom he had shortly before subjugated, and who from enemies became his most faithful and trusted supporters in his <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and the great barons of the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>. The royal treasury was also located at Lucera. During the invasion of Charles of Anjou Lucera made the longest resistance. The remaining <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> were converted <em>en masse</em> in 1300; their mosque was destroyed by Charles II, and upon its ruins arose the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, S. Maria della Vittoria. Local tradition traces the origin of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> to the third century (St. Bassus). The first historically certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Marcus (c. 743). Among other noteworthy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Nicol&ograve;, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> at Constantinople in 1261; the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Agostino Gasotti (1318), formerly <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Zagabria; Tommaso de Acerno (1378), author of "De creatione Urbani VI opusculum"; Scipione Bozzuti (1582), killed in a sack of the city by some exiles in 1591. In 1391 the Diocese of Lucera was increased by the addition of that of Farentino, or Castelfiorentino, a city founded in 1015 by the Byzantine catapan, Basileios. It was the place of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II's</a> death. After 1409 the See of Tortiboli (Tortibulum) created before 1236, was united to Lucera. Finally in 1818, the united Diocese of Montecorvino and Vulturaria were added to Lucera. Montecorvino became an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> in the tenth century, and among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was <a href="../cathen/01261b.htm">St. Albert</a> (d. 5 April, 1037). Its union with Vulturaria, a town now almost deserted, took place in 1433. Noteworthy among the later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was Alessandro Gerardini d'Amelia (1496), a Latin poet, author of many historical <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a>, and moral works, and one of the chief supporters of the expedition of <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a>; in 1515 he was transferred to San Domingo in America, where he died in 1521. The Diocese of Lucera has 17 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with 75,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; 4 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men and 6 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys and 3 for girls. In March, 1908, the Diocese of Troia was united with Lucera. It was established in the eleventh century, and has 9 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with 26,200 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, one <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, and three houses of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>.
