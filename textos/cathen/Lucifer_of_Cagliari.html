<h1>Lucifer of Cagliari</h1>  

<p>(LUCIFER CALARITANUS)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who must have been born in the early years of the fourth century; died in 371. His birthplace and the circumstances of his youth are unknown. He first appears in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, in full maturity of strength and abilities, in 354 when he was deputed by <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Pope Liberius</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Pancratius and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Hilary, to request the Emperor Constantius to convene a council, to deal with the accusations directed against <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> and his previous condemnation. This council was convened at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Lucifer there defended the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> with much passion and in very violent language, thus furnishing the adversaries of the great Alexandrian with a pretext for resentment and further <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and causing a new condemnation of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>. Constantius, unaccustomed to independence on the part of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, grievously maltreated Lucifer and his colleague, <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">Eusebius of Vercelli</a>. Both were exiled, Lucifer being sent to Germanica, in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and thence to Eleutheropolis in Palestine; he was finally relegated to the <a href="../cathen/14561a.htm">Thebaid</a>.

<p>In the course of this exile Lucifer wrote an extremely virulent pamphlet entitled "Ad Constantium Augustum pro sancto Athanasio libri II", an eloquent defence of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, but in such exaggerated language that it overshot the mark and injured the cause it was meant to serve. Lucifer boasted of his work, and Constantius, tyrant that he was, refrained from further revenge. After the death of Constantius, <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> allowed all the exiles to return to their cities. Lucifer went to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and at once meddled in the dissensions which divided the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party. He prolonged and embittered them by consecrating a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who appeared to him capable of continuing the opposition to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and party which he judged the weaker under the circumstances. Incapable of tact, he aggravated the dissenters, instead of dealing cautiously with them in order to win them, and displayed special severity towards those <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who had wavered in their adherence to the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a>. About this time a <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Council of Alexandria</a> presided over by St. Athanasius decreed that <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> renouncing their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> should be pardoned and that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who, by compulsion, had temporized with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should not be disturbed. Against this indulgence Lucifer protested, and went so far as to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> his former friend, <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">Eusebius of Vercelli</a>, who carried out the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Council of Alexandria</a>. Seeing that his extreme opinions won partisans neither West nor East, he withdrew to <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, resumed his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and formed a small <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> called the Luciferians. These sectaries pretended that all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who had participated in <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> should be deprived of their dignity, and that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who recognized the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of even repentant <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. The Luciferians, being earnestly opposed, commissioned two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, Marcellinus and Faustinus, to present a petition, the wellknown "Libellus precum", to the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a>, explaining their grievances and claiming protection. The emperor forbade further pursuit of them, and their <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> seems not to have lasted beyond this first generation.
