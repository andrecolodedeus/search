<h1>Ludolph of Saxony</h1>  

<p>(Ludolph the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a>).

<p>An <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer of the fourteenth century, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. 13 April, 1378. His life is as little known as his works are celebrated. We have no certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his native country; for in spite of his surname, "of Saxony", he may well, as <a href="../cathen/05270a.htm">Echard</a> remarks, have been born either in the Diocese of Cologne or in that of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, which then belonged to the Province of Saxony. He first joined the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, passed through an excellent course of literary and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies, and may have learnt the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of the spiritual life at the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> <a href="../cathen/14465c.htm">Tauler</a> and <a href="../cathen/07238c.htm">Suso</a>, his contemporaries and companions in religion. After about thirty years spent in the active life, he entered the Charterhouse of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> towards the year 1340. Three years later he was called upon to govern the newly founded (1331) Charterhouse of Coblentz; but scruples of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> led him to resign his office of prior in 1348; and, having again become a simple <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, first at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and afterwards at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, he spent the last thirty years of his life in retreat and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and died almost an octogenarian, universally esteemed for his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, although he never seems to have been <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with any public cult.

<p>Ludolph is one of the many writers to whom the authorship of "The Imitation of Christ" has been assigned; and if history protests against this, it must nevertheless acknowledge that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> author of that book has manifestly borrowed from the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a>. Other treatises and sermons now either lost or very <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> have also been attributed to him. Two books, however, commend him to posterity: (1) A "Commentary upon the Psalms", concise but excellent for its method, clearness, and solidity. He especially developed the spiritual sense, according to the interpretations of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, St. Augustine, <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>. This commentary, which was very popular in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, has passed through numerous editions, of which the first dates from 1491, and the last (Montreuil-sur-Mer) from 1891. (2) The "Vita Christi", his principal work. This is not a simple biography as we understand such today, but at once a history, a commentary borrowed from the Fathers, a series of dogmatic and moral dissertations, of spiritual instructions, meditations, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, in relation to the life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, from the eternal birth in the bosom of the Father to His <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>. It has been called a <em>summa evangelica</em>, so popular at that time, in which the author has condensed and resumed all that over sixty writers had said before him upon spiritual matters. Nothing shows better the great popularity of the "Vita Christi" than the numerous <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> copies preserved in <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> and the manifold editions of it which have been published, from the first two editions of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> and Cologne, in 1474, to the last editions of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (folio, 1865, and 8vo, 1878). It has besides been translated into Catalonian (Valencia, 1495, folio, Gothic), <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> (Alcala, folio, Gothic), Portuguese (1495, 4 vols., folio), Italian (1570), French, "by Guillaume Lernenand, of the Order of Monseigneur St. Fran&ccedil;ois", under the title of the "Great Life of Christ" (Lyons, 1487, folio, many times reprinted), and more recently by D. Marie-Prosper Augustine (Paris, 1864) and by D. Florent Broquin, <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> (Paris, 1883). St. Teresa and <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a> frequently quote from it, and it has not ceased to afford delight to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, who find in it instruction and edification, food for both mind and heart.
