<h1>Ludwig Babenstuber</h1>  

<p>A German <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>; vice-chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>; born 1660 at Teining in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>; died 5 April, 1726, at the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Ettal. Having completed his early studies he entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the Order of St. Benedict, at Ettal in 1681, made his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> in 1682, and thereafter devoted the greater part of his life to teaching. At the commencement of his studies he had given no promise of brilliancy, but by his untiring application and industry he shortly acquired so vast a store of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that he soon came to be regarded as one of the most learned men of his day &#151; <em>vir comsummatae in omni genere doctrinae et probitatis</em>, as he is styled in Dom Egger's "Idea ordinis Hierarchico-Benedictini", and in the "History of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>". Until 1690 Babenstuber was Director of the scholasticate of his order at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> there from 1690 to 1693, then went to Schlehdoft to teach <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the canons regular.

<p>Returning to Salzburg in 1695, the took up successively the professorships of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>, in the celebrated <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of that city. He remained at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> for twenty-two years, during which period he held the office of vice-rector for three years, and that of vice-chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> for six. In 1717 he returned to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Ettal, where he spent the remainder of his days. In <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> Babenstuber was a pronounced <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomist</a>; in <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral</a>, a vigorous defender of <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">probabilism</a>. He maintained, among other things, that a single author, if he were "beyond contradiction" (<em>omni exceptione major</em>), could, of his own authority, render an opinion probably, even against general opinion. In matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, however, he rejected the principle of <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">probabilism</a> absolutely. In one of his disquisitions he had also stated that it was allowable to celebrate <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> privately on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a> and <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>, but before his "Ethica Supernaturalis" had issued from the press, he learned that the Roman tribunals forbade it, and so he promptly corrected that assertion. Babenstuber's published works include a wide range of subjects, mainly <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>. The most important are: "Philosophia Thomistica" (4 vols., Salzburg, 1704); "Ethica Supernaturalis" (Augsburg, 1718).
