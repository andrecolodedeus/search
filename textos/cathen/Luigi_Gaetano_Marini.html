<h1>Luigi Gaetano Marini</h1>  

<p>A natural <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, jurist, historian, archeologist, born at Sant' Orcangelo (pagus Acerbotanus), 18 Dec., 1742; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 7 May, 1815. Having received a comprehensive preparatory <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at the College of San Marino and at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, he was able to pass through the legal and philological studies at Bologna University brilliantly, and to graduate at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> <em>in utroque jure</em> (in both branches of law). He went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in Dec., 1764, where he gained the friendship of <a href="../cathen/01255a.htm">Cardinal Alessandro Albani</a> and Garampi. He entered into relations with the most distinguished scholars of his day, and maintained with them an extensive correspondence. In 1772 he was appointed coadjutor to Marino Zampini, prefect of the archives; and was also given the position by the Roman Republic of prefect of the archives at the Vatican and the Castle of St. Angelo, as well as that of president of the Vatican Museum and the Vatican Library. On 18 Aug., 1800, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> made him <em>primus custos</em> of the Vatican Library and also prefect of the archives. In Jan., 1805, he was made a <em>cameriere d'onore</em> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>When the archives of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> were carried off to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, he accompanied them, and reached <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 11 April, 1810. After <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> fall the Count of Artois, viceregent and brother of the king, issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on 19 April, 1814, directing the restitution to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> of the archives, of all documents and Manuscripts, and of several other collections. On 28 April the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> commissioners, Mgr. de Gregorio, Mgr. Gaetano Marini, and his nephew Don Marino Marini, took charge of the whole of this <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>; but before it had reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Gaetano Marini, who had long been an invalid, died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He was a scholar of eminent parts, a thorough master of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew; and possessed profound legal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. By choice he took up questions of natural philosophy; as an <a href="../cathen/01688a.htm">archeologist</a> and historian he is esteemed even today. His great work on papyrus records is a standard work on the investigation of papyri. His book on the Arval Brothers of ancient <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, showed great erudition and brought to light so much that was new, that its appearance created considerable stir. His classification of five thousand inscriptions, both <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, in the Galleria Lapidaria at the Vatican, is a masterpiece, and earned for him the honorary title of "Restorer" of Latin epigraphics ["Inscriptiones (only preserved in Manuscript) christian&aelig; Latin&aelig; et Gr&aelig;c&aelig; &aelig;vi Milliarii conlegit digessit adnotationibusque auxit Caietanus Marinus a Bibliotheca Vaticana item a scriniis sedis apostolic&aelig;. Du&aelig; partes"]. Marini was a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, but not a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He was distinguished for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, often <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for hours before the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. He went to communion three times a week. During his residence in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> he gave away <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to the extent of 3000 scudi (dollars).
