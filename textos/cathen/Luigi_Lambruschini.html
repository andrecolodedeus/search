<h1>Luigi Lambruschini</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, b. at Sestri Levante, near <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, 6 March, 1776, d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 12 May, 1854. As a youth he entered the Order of the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a>, in which he held many important offices. On account of his learning he was made consultor of several <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>, and in 1815 accompanied <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Cardinal Consalvi</a> to the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in the capacity of secretary. After his return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he was made secretary of the Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, then recently instituted by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, and thus took a great part in concluding <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordats</a> with various states, especially with <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. In 1819 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> and governed the archdiocese with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. His eloquent sermons attracted large audiences, and his pastoral letters exhibit much spiritual unction. In 1827 <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> sent him as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, but the Revolution of July, 1830, compelled him to interrupt his mission. On his return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he was made a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> (1831) by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, who, on the resignation of Cardinal Bernetti, appointed Lambruschini Secretary of State. This appointment aroused much discontent among the Romans, but it was soon evident that Lambruschini was the proper man for the post. His character and disposition accorded perfectly with those of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>: in the ecclesiastico-political relations with other nations both were persuaded that it was time to abandon the conciliatory policy inaugurated by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, a conviction that was soon justified by events. The occasion was the Cologne question, which had arisen in 1837 out of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of <a href="../cathen/05161b.htm">Mgr. Droste-Vischering</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>. The diplomatic documents exchanged at this time between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government, and published in 1838, are models of clear exposition, close argument, and elegant form. G&ouml;rres described the series as a "calm, vigorous, masculine, and substantial polemic". Lambruschini's firm stand caused the recall of Bunsen, the. <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> minister at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Next to <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> and <a href="../cathen/11380b.htm">Pacca</a>, Lambruschini was among the greatest diplomats of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in the nineteenth century. As regards the internal policy of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>, he, like <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, was opposed to the constitutional form, and certainly, if we consider the arrogance of <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> under <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory</a>, neither the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> nor his secretary can be charged with serious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.

<p>In the first ballot of the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1846, Lambruschini received a majority of the votes, but not enough for election. When <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> was chosen, Lambruschini recognized that he could not follow the policy of the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who favored constitutionalism. He accordingly resigned his office for that of secretary of Briefs, and later that of prefect of rites. In the Revolution of 1848 he was the object of especial <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>; his dwelling was plundered, his bed cut to pieces with daggers, and he himself was scarcely able, disguised as a stableman, to join <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> at <a href="../cathen/06333a.htm">Gaeta</a>. As the Suburbicarian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12290a.htm">Porto and Santa Rufina</a> he restored the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Porto. He was also commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/05785d.htm">Farfa</a>, where he founded a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabites</a> at Catinari, where he had spent a great part of his <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. He published "Opere spirituali" in three volumes (Rome, 1838) and later a small work in defense of the Immaculate Conception.
<h2>Giambattista Lambruschini</h2>

<p>Brother of the preceding, d. at <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>, 24 Nov., 1826. He was <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, whence he was expelled by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> in 1800, when he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a> in 1807, he was deported to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for not taking the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. In 1814 he returned to <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>.
<h2>Raffaele Lambruschini</h2>

<p>Nephew of Luigi and Giambattista, b. at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, 14 August, 1788; d. 8 March, 1873, at Figline in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. As a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> he was first with his uncle Giambattista at <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>. Being suspected of Liberal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, he returned to Figline, where he devoted himself to the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, especially agriculture, and in 1827 founded the "Giornale Agrario Toscano". He also established an <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institution</a>, and published (1836-44) the "Guida dell' educatore", as well as several pedagogical and scholastic works. In 1848 he was elected to the Parliament of the republic, and in 1860 was appointed senator of the realm. He was also consul of the Accademia della Crusca and (1868-69) professor at the Institute of Higher Studies at Florence.
