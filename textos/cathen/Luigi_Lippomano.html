<h1>Luigi Lippomano</h1>  

<p>(<em>Or</em> Aloisius Lipomanus Lippomano).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, hagiographer, b. in 1500; d. 15 August, 1559. Of a noble <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, he devoted himself from his youth to the study of the classical languages and later to the pursuit of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a>. Distinguished for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and integrity of character, he was among the first in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to join the "Oratorio della Carit&agrave;" founded by <a href="../cathen/03145a.htm">St. Cajetan of Tiene</a>, and composed of distinguished men, who in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> were the leaven of Church reform, and afterwards took a prominent part in the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Methone (1538), and appointed coadjutor to his uncle Pietro Lippomano, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02489c.htm">Bergamo</a>, who was also active in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reform. When Pietro was transferred to <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> (1544), Luigi accompanied him and succeeded him in that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1548, whence he was transferred to Bergamo in 1558. In 1542 <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> sent him as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> to announce the convocation of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, where he arrived in 1547 and was commissioned to present to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the reasons for transferring the council to Bologna. In 1548 he was sent with Bertano and Pighi to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. From 1551 he was one of the presidents of the council until its suspension (25 April, 1552), during that period the dogmatic decrees on the Eucharist, penance, and extreme unction were published, as well as several decrees on reform. In 1556 <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> sent him as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, where, on account of his lively opposition to the pretensions of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> nobility, his life was frequently threatened. After his return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he remained in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> until his death. Amid his numerous official <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, he did not neglect his studies, which, however, he directed towards spiritual edification. Thus he wrote "Catenae in Genesin" (Paris, 1546), "In Exodum" (Paris, 1550) &mdash; both works republished at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1557; "Confirmazione e stabilimento di tutti li dogmi cattoliei . . . contro i novatori" (Venice, 1553). His chief work was "Sanctorum priscorum patrum vitae" (8 vols., Venice, 1551-60; 2 vols., <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> 1564), for which he engaged the services of many learned men, and himself, on his travels, searched <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> and archives. This collection gave a great impulse to scientific <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiography</a>, and opened the way for <a href="../cathen/14343c.htm">Surius</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>.
