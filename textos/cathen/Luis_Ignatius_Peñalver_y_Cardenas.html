<h1>Luis Ignatius Pe&ntilde;alver y Cardenas</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, son of a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> and noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; born at <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a>, 3 April, 1749; died there, 17 July, 1810. After studying belles-lettres and philosophy in St. Ignatius College of his native city, he followed there the courses of the University of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and in 1771 obtained the degree of Doctor of Theology. Having distinguished himself by his learning and charity, his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> entrusted him with several missions of an administrative nature, and in 1773 appointed him provisor and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. When <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, in deference to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Carlos VI, King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, created Louisiana and the Floridas a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, distinct from that of Santiago de Cuba, Luis Penalver was made it first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He made his entrance into <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> on 17 July, 1795, took formal possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and in the following December published an "Instrucci&oacute;n para el govierno de los p&aacute;rrocos de la di&oacute;cesis de la Luisiana". He soon began the visitation of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which then extended over the country <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> later as the "Louisiana Purchase Territory". On 21 April, 1796, he was at Iberville, on 8 November of the same year at <a href="../cathen/10710a.htm">Natchitoches</a>, and at Pensacola on 7 May, 1798. Upon his return in 1799, he drew up a report in which he complained bitterly of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, irreligion, and the want of discipline which then prevailed in Louisiana.

<p>Bishop Pe&ntilde;alver was promoted to the Archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a> on 20 July, 1801, and by a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">Rescript</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was empowered to transfer his authority in <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> and the Floridas to Canon Thomas Hasset, his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and to Rev. Patrick Walsh. After a chase by an English war-vessel, Archbishop Pe&ntilde;alver arrived at <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, where he soon attained to prominence through the interest he manifested in questions that concerned <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and the public good. At his own expense he built a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and various schools. He resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> on 1 March, 1806, and, returning to <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a>, devoted the last years of his life to charitable works. At his death he bequeathed $200,000 to the poor and several important legacies to <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>.
