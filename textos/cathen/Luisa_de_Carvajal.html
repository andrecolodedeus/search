<h1>Luisa de Carvajal</h1>  

<p>Born 2 Jan., 1568, at Jaraizejo, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; died 2 Jan., 1614, at <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, a lady of high birth, who received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> what appears to have been a special vocation to go to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and minister to those who were suffering for the Faith. Left an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> at the age of six, she was brought up by her uncle and aunt at <a href="../cathen/11437a.htm">Pampeluna</a>, where she showed evidence of extraordinary <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. She resolutely refused to marry; yet she had no attraction to the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. On the death of her aunt and uncle she collected a few <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of her uncle's former household, and they led a life of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> together. This continued for twelve years, until her <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> confessor at length allowed her to fulfil her desire of setting out for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, in 1605. On arriving in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, Luisa assembled a little community similar to the former one at <a href="../cathen/11437a.htm">Pampeluna</a>. She spent her time in visiting those in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and going to the houses of others in danger of apprehension. She had the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of ministering to <a href="../cathen/13098c.htm">Father Roberts, O.S.B.</a>, and Thomas Somers, a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>, immediately before their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Her life attracted the attention of the authorities, who said she was doing more to convert <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> than twenty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. On two occasions pretexts were found for putting her in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; on each occasion she was released at the instance of the Spanish ambassador. Attempts were then made with the latter to procure her removal from the kingdom. These would probably in the end have succeeded, had they not been prevented by her death which occurred on her forty-sixth birthday.
