<h1>Luise Hensel</h1>  

<p>Poetess and convert; born at Linum, 30 March, 1798; died at <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, 18 December, 1876. Her father was Johann Hensel, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> parson at Linum in the Mark of Brandenburg. After the father's death in 1809, the mother with her son and three daughters returned to her birthplace, <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> dwelt, at first in somewhat needy circumstances. Luise attended the high school (<em>Realschule</em>), now the Elisabethschule, showing extraordinary talent. In consequence of the religious teaching there, she conceived <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> creed. When she was about to be confirmed (on 31 March, 1813), she made the following compact with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: "that by this act I only embrace <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in general and renew the covenant of my <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but that I in no way agree to bind myself to any creed concerning which I am not convinced as to whether or not it is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> established by Christ". The political events in 1813 inspired several fervid patriotic poems. Three years later she for the first time made the acquaintance of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, Klemens Brentano. It was the poet himself who during the "Storm and Stress" period was the first to profit by this intercourse; he became once more a devout <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and accordingly he justly called his friend "the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in the wilderness". Luise's gradual approach to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ended in her <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>, which came about, without creating the slightest sensation, on 8 December, 1818, in the Hedwigskirche, Berlin. Her subsequent career was like a perpetual journey. She left Berlin and became companion to the Princess Salm in <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a> and D&uuml;sseldorf. Then (in 1820) she undertook the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the three youngest daughters of <a href="../cathen/14299b.htm">Count von Stolberg</a>, holding the same relation to her nephew in Wiedenbr&uuml;ck (Westphalia) in 1823; then, after a short sojourn in Coblenz and on the Marienberg near Boppard, she took the position of head teacher of the St. Leonard's Academy for girls at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, which she held for six years. She was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to give up this abundantly blest activity owing to ill health and returned to her brother's pleasant home in <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, where she nursed her aging mother until the death of the latter in 1835. Then began another period of wandering activity in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> fields: in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Neuburg (1840-41), in Cologne (1841-50), then again in Wiedenbr&uuml;ck. Finally she settled in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Society of the Daughters of Christian Love at <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, where the foundress, Pauline von Malinckrodt, a former pupil of hers, had set aside a home for her. There she passed the twilight of her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> life in peaceful retirement, without becoming a member of the order.

<p>Her poetic works consist of more or less religious verses composed for special occasions. They were published in various places. Unfortunately her modesty would not admit of a complete edition of her writings. The most just and impartial judgment on her muse has been passed by R. M. Meyer* in his "Deutsche Literatur des 19. Jahrhunderts" (1906, p. 79). "In her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> she compares herself in one place to an ugly little vase in which beautiful flowers have been put: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> special grace; it was preeminently by His grace that every <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> became a poem to her, and each poem a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The result was a rich bouquet of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> songs, the impressive simplicity of which reminds one of the old songs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. She wrote with little care, scribbling her verses on scraps of paper. But thousands and tens of thousands found edification in those simple <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, a tribute denied to the admirable, spiritual poems of her friend Klemens." The most important edition of her poems is that by C. Schl&uuml;ter (Paderborn, 1869), several times reprinted.
