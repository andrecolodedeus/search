<h1>Luke Rivington</h1>  

<p>Born in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, May, 1838; died in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 30 May, 1899; fourth son of Francis Rivington, a well-known <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> publisher. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Highgate Grammar School and Magdalen College, <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford</a>. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> as an <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> in 1862, he became <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> of St. Clement's, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, leaving there in 1867 for All Saint's, Margaret Street, London, where he attracted attention as a preacher. Failing in his efforts to found a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community at Stoke, Staffordshire, he joined the Cowley Fathers and became superior of their house in <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>. Becoming unsettled in his religious convictions he visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where in 1888 he was received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. His <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> took place on 21 Sept., 1889. He returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and settled in Bayswater, not undertaking any <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> work, but devoting himself to preaching, hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>, and writing controversial works. The chief of these were "Authority; or a plain reason for joint the Church of Rome" (1888); "Dust" a letter to the Rev. C. Gore on his book "Roman Catholic Claims" (1888); "Dependence; or the insecurity of the Anglican Position" (1889) "The Primitive Church and the See of Peter" (1894); "Anglican Fallacies; or Lord Halifax on Reunion" (1895); "Rome and England or Ecclesiastical Continuity" (1897); "The Roman Primacy A.D. 430-51" (1899) which was practically a new edition of "The Primitive Church and the See of Peter". He also wrote several pamphlets and brought out a new edition of <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Bishop Milner's</a> "End of Religious Controversy". This was for the <a href="../cathen/15077a.htm">Catholic Truth Society</a> of which he was long a member of the committee, and a prominent figure at the annual conferences so successfully organized by the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. His pamphlets include "Primitive and Roman" (1894) a reply to the notice of his book "The Primitive Church" in the "Church Quarterly Review"; "The Conversion of Cardinal Newman" (1896) and "Tekel" (1897) in which he criticized the reply of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and York to <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> after the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">Anglican Orders</a>. In 1897 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> conferred on him an honorary doctorate in divinity. During his latter years he lived near St. James church, Spanish Place, devoting himself to his literary work and the instruction of inquirers in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>.
