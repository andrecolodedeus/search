<h1>Lul&eacute; Indians</h1>  

<p>A name which has given rise to considerable confusion and dispute in <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentine</a> ethnology, owing to the fact, now established, that it was applied at different times to two very different peoples, neither of which now exists under that name, while the vocabulary which could settle the affinity of the earlier tribe is now lost. The name itself, meaning "inhabitants", conveys no ethnic significance, being a term applied indiscriminately by the invading M&aacute;taco from the east to the tribes which they found already in occupancy of the country.

<p>The Lul&eacute; of the earlier period appear to have been the tribe more definitely known under their Quichua name of <em>Cacana</em>, "mountaineers", occupying the hill ranges of the upper Salado river in the provinces of Catamarca and Western Tucuman, <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentina</a>. They were of the stock of the Calchaqui, the southernmost tributaries of the historic Quichua of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, from whom they had absorbed a high degree of aboriginal culture. Owing to their relations with the Quichua on the one hand and with the neighbouring Toconot&eacute; (also Tonocot&eacute;), or Matar&aacute;, on the other, they were familiar also with these languages as well as their own, a fact which has served much to increase the confusion. By the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary <a href="../cathen/02291a.htm">Alonso B&aacute;rcena (or Barzana)</a> the Lul&eacute; (Cacana) were gathered, in 1589, into a mission settlement on the Salado, near the Spanish town of Salavera or Esteco. The Matar&aacute;, or Toconot&eacute;, were evangelized at the same time. Here, within the following twenty years, they were visited also by St. Francis Solano. In 1692 the region was devastated by a terrible earthquake which destroyed the towns of Esteco and Concepci&oacute;n, together with the missions, in consequence of which the terror-stricken <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> fled into the forests of the great Chaco wilderness north of the Salado, and became lost to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, while the grammar and vocabulary which Father B&aacute;cena had composed of the Toconot&eacute; language disappeared likewise.

<p>The Lul&eacute; of the later period are better known, being the principal of a group of cognate tribes constituting the Lulean stock, formerly ranging over the central and western Chaco region in <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentina</a>, chiefly between the Verlado and the Vermijo, in the province of <a href="../cathen/13404a.htm">Salta</a>. Although the classification of the <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentine</a> dialects is still incomplete and in dispute, the following extent or extinct tribes seem to come within the Lulean linguistic group: Lul&eacute; proper (so called by the M&aacute;taco), calling themselves <em>Pel&eacute;</em>, "men", and believed to be the Oristin&eacute; of the earliest missionary period; Toconot&eacute;, called Matar&aacute; by the Quicha, and incorrectly identified by Machoni with the M&aacute;taco of another stock; Isistin&eacute;; Toquistin&eacute;; Chulup&iacute;, Chunup&iacute;, or Cinip&iacute;; Vilelo, called Quiatzu by the M&aacute;taco, with sub-tribes Guamica and Tequet&eacute;; Omoampa, with sub-tribes Iya and Yeconoampa; Juri; Pasain&eacute;.

<p>In general, the Lulean tribes were below median stature, pedestrian in habit, peaceful and unwarlike, except in <a href="../cathen/13691a.htm">self-defense</a>, living partly by hunting and partly by agriculture, contrasting strongly with the athletic and predatory equestrian tribes of the eastern Chaco represented by the <a href="../cathen/01044c.htm">Abipone</a> and M&aacute;taco. The still wild Chulup&iacute; of the Pilcomayo, however, resemble the latter tribes in physique and warlike character. In consequence of the ceaseless inroads of the wild Chaco tribes upon the Spanish settlements, Governor Urizar, about the year 1710, led against them a strong expedition from Tucuman which for a time brought to submission those savages who were unable to escape beyond his reach. As one result, the Lul&eacute; were, in 1711, gathered into a mission called San Est&eacute;ban, at Miraflores on the Salado, about one hundred miles below Salta, under the charge of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Father</a> Antonio Machoni. Machoni prepared a grammar and dictionary of their language (Madrid, 1732), for which reason it is sometimes known as the "Lul&eacute; of Machoni", to distinguish it from the Cacana Lul&eacute; of the earlier period. San Jos&eacute;, or Petaca, was established among the Vilelo in 1735. In consequence of the inroads of the wild tribes, these missions were temporarily abandoned, but were re-established in 1751-52. In 1751 the cognate Isistin&eacute; and Toquistin&eacute; were gathered into the new mission of <a href="../cathen/13447a.htm">San Juan</a> Bautista. In 1763, Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Buen Consejo, or Ortega, was established for the Omoampa and their sub-tribes, and Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora la Columna, or Macapillo, for the Passain&eacute;, both on the Salado below Miraflores, and all five being within the province of <a href="../cathen/13404a.htm">Salta</a>. The 1767, just before the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the five mission of the cognate Lulean tribes had a population of 2346 Indians, almost all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, served by eleven <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, among them being Father Jos&eacute; Iolis, author of a history of the Chaco.

<p>Notwithstanding the civilizing efforts of the missionaries, the Lul&eacute; shared in the general and swift decline of the native tribes consequent upon the advent of the whites, resulting in repeated visitations of the smallpox scourge &#151; previously unknown &#151; the wholesale raids of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> slave-hunters (<em>Mamelucos</em>), and the oppression of the forced-labour systems under the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>. The mission Indians were the special prey both of the slave-hunters and of the predatory wild tribes. On the withdraw of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the mission <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was confiscated or otherwise wasted, while the Indians who were not reduced to practical slavery fled into the forests. At present the cognate Lulean tribes are represented chiefly by some Vilelo living among the M&aacute;taco on the middle Vermejo and by the uncivilized Chilup&iacute; on the Picomayo.
