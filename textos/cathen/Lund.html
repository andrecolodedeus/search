<h1>Lund</h1>  

<p>[LUNDA; LONDUNUM (LONDINUM) GOTHORUM (SCANORUM, SCANDINORUM, or DANORUM)].

<p>In the L&auml;n of Malm&ouml;hus &#151; ancient <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> diocese. The city is now the capital of the former <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> province of Skaane (Scania), and is situated on an elevated wooded site in a fertile country, about eight miles from the Sound and twenty-four miles east of Copenhagen. It has a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> with a large <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> containing about 200,000 volumes, and over 2,000 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, a high school, and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of languages, arts, and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> observatory, botanical gardens, historical museum, several <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, insane asylum, important industries, breweries, and numerous factories for the manufacture of cloth, linen, leather, hardware, bricks, and tiles. It is now a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> see. Its superb Romanesque <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (its <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> dates from the eleventh or twelfth century) was restored in 1833-78. Of the other numerous <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> churches (21 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, 9 monastic churches) there now remains only St. Peter's church (monastery of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>) which dates from the middle of the twelfth century. A new All Saints' church was built in 1888-1891. The city has four large public squares and many small irregular streets, the names of which occasionally recall the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> past. Of especial interest are the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> square and the adjoining "Lundagaard", so called after the former royal castle which stood there, its ancient tower alone remaining. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> Lund was famous as the principal city of the north (<em>metropolis Dani&aelig;, caput ipsius regni</em>). Through the centuries (1172, 1234, 1263, 1287, 1678, 1711) the city suffered much from fire and the devastations of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; the kings in their quarrels with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> exhibiting the temper of <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>. In 1452 Lund was destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> king, Charles Knutsson, and never recovered from this disaster. The city declined steadily from the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> and had well nigh lost all its importance when by the Treaty of Roskilde (1658) <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to cede the Provinces of Skaane, Halland, and Blekinge to Sweden. Even the establishment (1666) and endowment of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> (1668) did not raise Lund to its former influential position. In the beginning of the eighteenth century the population had decreased to six hundred and eighty <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; thenceforth it grew slowly until towards the end of the century it numbered three thousand <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. In the nineteenth century trade, commerce and industries greatly increased, and the population grew from 8,385 in 1858, to 19,464 in 1908, nearly all <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>Lund brings us back to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and fabulous period of Scandinavia. Nothing authentic is known about the origin of the city but it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that as early as the ninth century Lund was a place of great commercial importance. The insignificant stream Hajeaa which now flows near Lund and empties into the Lomma Bay in the south-west was for one thousand years navigable by large vessels. The name Lund (a small wood or grove) is derived from a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> sacrificial grove which lay to the east of the city, and where the <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> of the North, Odin, Thor, Frigga, were <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a>. Lund is first mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Icelandic</a> saga, which tells us that the city, surrounded by a wooden rampart, was plundered and burnt in 940 by the <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Vikings</a>. The conversion of the North to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was begun a century earlier by Archbishop Ebbo of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> and <a href="../cathen/01544c.htm">St. Anschar</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>-Bremen, his successor in this apostolic work; both worked here personally and also sent missionaries. But the results were neither notable nor lasting, at least in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>. <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Heathenism</a> was not easily uprooted, and in many places was strong enough to prevent the building of churches and the foundation of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. The missionaries succeeded only in Jutland, where they established the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/13542a.htm">Schleswig</a>, <a href="../cathen/16070b.htm">Ribe</a>, and Aarhus (946) as suffragans of Hamburg-Bremen. It was only under King Svend Tvesk&aelig;g (960-1014) and his son Canute (Knud) the Great (1014-1035) that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> made any headway in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. They reigned over <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> also, hence the growing English influence in religion, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and commerce. Svend obtained English missionaries for Skaane, among them was Gotebald (d. about 1021), first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/16071c.htm">Roskilde</a>. Besides other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> Svend erected also the first church in Lund, and dedicated it to the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a>. During his reign the See of <a href="../cathen/16064d.htm">Odense</a> was established on the Island of F&uuml;nen (988).

<p>Canute did still more for the Scandinavian countries, especially for the development of Lund; he encouraged industries and trade and erected at Lund the first mint in Scandinavia. Perhaps <a href="../cathen/01132c.htm">Adam of Bremen</a> was right when he said: "Cuius (sc. Sconi&aelig;) metropolis civitas Lundona quam victor Angli&aelig; Chnud Britannic&aelig; London&aelig; &aelig;mulam jussit esse" (Pertz, "Monum. Germ.", VII, 371), i.e., Canute desired to make Scandinavian Lund the rival of English London. At least he laid the foundation for the growing importance of Lund as the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of Scandinavia. In later centuries Lund was again a royal residence and even more important than Roskilde and Ringsted. Canute VI celebrated at Lund in 1177 his marriage with Henry the Lion's daughter, Gertrude of Saxony; Waldemar the Victorious was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> there in 1202 and it was there in 1409 that took place the marriage between Eric of <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a> and Philippa of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Soon also it became a place of great <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> importance. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lund was Bernard, who had been for five years in <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Iceland</a> and was sent by Canute to Lund in 1022. Canute also filled other sees in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> with men who had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, in violation of the right of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>; therefore when Gerbrand, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/16071c.htm">Roskilde</a> at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, repaired to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, he was seized by Archbishop Unvan of Hamburg-Bremen and set free only on submitting to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> as his <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> (1022). The king now saw that he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to recognize the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>-Bremen, and in this he was followed by the Kings of Sweden and <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>. <a href="../cathen/01132c.htm">Adam of Bremen</a> concluded from this that the supremacy of the See of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a> was respected as a matter of fact in all Scandinavian countries; every <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a>, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he says, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to report to Archbishop Libentius II (1029-32) the progress of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in their respective countries (Pertz, "Monum. Germ.", VII, 328).



<p>Lund, however, was not properly a see until Svend Estridsen, the successor of Canute, separated Skaane ecclesiastically from <a href="../cathen/16071c.htm">Roskilde</a> (1048) and created two sees, Lund and Dalby. After the death of the unworthy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Henry of Lund, Dalby and Lund were united (1060) but there still remained at Dalby a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of regular canons with a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>. The Province of Skaane must have numbered at that time about three hundred churches (Pertz, "Monum. Germ", VII, 370). The building of a new stone <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> which was to be dedicated to <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> furthered by the saintly King Canute (1086). Through richly endowed foundations he sought to maintain <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> service worthily, and can therefore rightly be called the founder of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. His deed of gift for this (21 May, 1085) was done apparently on the occasion of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the church and is the oldest extant <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> royal deed on record in the original.

<p>Later donations were so numerous that the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> became the richest church in the North. Lund was also the foremost, though one of the most recent, sees in the Scandinavian Church, only Viborg and B&ouml;rglum in Jutland being later foundations (1065). Contemporaneously there began for <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> an epoch of great prosperity, which is still the national <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. This prosperous development was owing to the new <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> autonomy and independence of the Scandinavian countries, formerly under the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>-Bremen. By several <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a> missionary work in the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> North had been originally assigned to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>-<a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, also the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over those countries when <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Later, however, several sees were created in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> which had already endeavoured to establish a direct union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and to do away with a foreign and troublesome intermediary authority. This was all the more reasonable from the moment that the Bremen <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, as worldly princes, began to be occupied with affairs of State to the neglect of their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as spiritual shepherds. They undertook to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> their dependent suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or at least reserved to themselves the right of ratification of those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> when named by the king.

<p>For <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> the danger was imminent that the powerful Bremen Metropolitan might misuse his influence and by interference in the internal affairs of the country endanger its political liberty and independence. Canute had already planned the establishment of a Scandinavian church province; but it was only under his successor Svend Estridsen ("cuius industria Dania in octo episcopatus divisa est", Langebek, "Script. rer. dan.", III, 444) that negotiations were begun at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Adalbert of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> opposed the independence of these northern sees, except on condition that his own <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> were promoted to the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> over the whole North. After the death of Adalbert (1072) his successor Liemar sided with Henry IV in the Investitures conflict and <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> invited King Svend to resume the former negotiations. Svend died, however, about 1075 and the Northern Church question rested for some time till Eric Ejegod, the second successor of St. Canute, took up the affair anew and brought it to a close. Apparently, at the Synod of <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a> in which <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Anselm of Canterbury</a> also took part, Eric obtained from <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> two requests: the establishment of an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of his brother Canute. Under Paschal II (1100) the efforts of Eric were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with success, and the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of Canute was solemnized in <a href="../cathen/16064d.htm">Odense</a>, all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the country being present. Shortly after this Eric died in the <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Island of Cyprus</a> (1103), while on a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the Holy Land. At the same time Cardinal Alberich repaired to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to select an appropriate see for the new <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. His choice fell on Lund, and the local <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Asger (Adzer), a friend of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Anselm of Canterbury</a>, received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> dignity (1104). In this way the Northern Church was freed from its dependence on Bremen-Hamburg. Adalbero of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, after the Concordat of Worms (1128), was very anxious to revive the old <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in their plenitude, and for this purpose did not shrink from forging <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a>.

<p>Emperor Lothair III, in the hope of gaining politically by the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which in the meanwhile had broken out in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, supported at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Adalbero's request. In fact <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> restored the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> over all the northern sees, as is shown by several contemporary letters to Adalbero, to Archbishop Asger, and to the Kings of Sweden and <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. Asger, however, held fast to his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, encouraged by his nephew <a href="../cathen/05538b.htm">Eskil</a>, then <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Lund, who sent Hermann, a canon of Lund, and a Rhinelander, to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where he defended successfully the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Lund guaranteed fully to him thirty years before. This ended for all time the ambitious plans of domination long cherished by the Prelate of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>; the lofty dream of a Patriarchate of the North toppled; even the authority of a <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a> (1158) could not revive it. Later Hermann became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13542a.htm">Schleswig</a>; he is buried in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Lund. In 1134 Asger was confirmed in his dignity by <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>, through the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> Cardinal Martin. In 1139 his successor <a href="../cathen/05538b.htm">Eskil</a> held at Lund the first Northern National Council under the presidency of Cardinal Theodignus. The <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/05538b.htm">Eskil</a> in 1145, making in all with those of the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> sixty-four <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> altars. When in 1152 a separate <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> was established at <a href="../cathen/15064a.htm">Trondhjem</a> (Nidaros) for <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> with <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Faroe Islands, <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Iceland</a>, and Greenland as suffragans, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Lund received the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> with the title of <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and Sweden. Under <a href="../cathen/05538b.htm">Eskil's</a> reign the ecclesiastical law of Skaane (1162) and Zeeland (1171) was codified, numerous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> founded and the Archbishopric of Upsala established (1164). After the conquest of R&uuml;gen (1169) the See of <a href="../cathen/16071c.htm">Roskilde</a> was divided and the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Lund was enlarged. Later the North German sees of L&uuml;beck, <a href="../cathen/16070a.htm">Ratzeburg</a>, Schwerin, and Cammin were added to Lund as suffragans.

<p>Under <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> <a href="../cathen/01060a.htm">Absalon</a> (1177-1201), and Andreas Sunes&ouml;n, 1201-23, Lund was at the zenith of its power. <a href="../cathen/01060a.htm">Absalon</a> was equally prominent as prince of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and as statesman and continues to be reckoned one of the most prominent men of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. Both he and <a href="../cathen/05538b.htm">Eskil</a> encouraged monastic life and were patrons of the arts and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. During his reign the famous historian <a href="../cathen/13497a.htm">Saxo Grammaticus</a> was <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of <a href="../cathen/16071c.htm">Roskilde</a> (1208). <a href="../cathen/01060a.htm">Absalon</a> rendered service to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by strict discipline and the introduction of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. His successor Andreas was a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and saintly man highly <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> and the most learned <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. The epic "Hexa&euml;meron" and several <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> testify to his gifts as a classical scholar. He took part personally in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a> against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> in Livonia and Esthonia and established three new suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> in Reval, Leal, and Virland which were lost by the sale of Esthonia to the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a> (1346). Under him the first <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was established in Lund (1221). He was probably present at the Lateran Council and is said to have been the only Dane who ever received a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat. He died in 1228 after he had resigned about 1223 on account of ill-health; it has been suggested on account of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>.

<p>The second half of the century was saddened by weary strifes between the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and Kings Christopher I and Eric Menved. <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> Jacob Erlandsen and Jens Grand were cruelly <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and the country fell under an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>. Jens Grand escaped from his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> removed the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> from Lund. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> lived several years in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, received in 1307 the See of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> and died at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, 1326. The disorders of the time were responsible for the decline of Lund in secular and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. The Province of Skaane passed (1332-1360) to <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, was reconquered and was definitely lost by the Peace of <a href="../cathen/16071c.htm">Roskilde</a> (1658). At the same time the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Lund's influence disappeared for the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15207a.htm">Upsala</a> assumed complete authority over Lund, thereby depriving the dignity of <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Sweden of all meaning. During the time just preceding the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> church affairs were in a very bad way in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. Archbishop Birger (1519) rendered valuable service by having the "Missale lundense", the "Breviarium ecclesi&aelig; lundensis", the "Statuta provincialia" as well as the "Historia danica" of <a href="../cathen/13497a.htm">Saxo Grammaticus</a> printed at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. After his death there were complications and dissensions between Christian II and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. The originally elected Aage Sparre who was withdrawn to favour the king's choice, J&ouml;rgen Skodborg, succeeded (1523) in occupying the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> chair but resigned in 1532, powerless to stay the advances of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The last <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Torben Bille, who, however, was never <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by command of Christian III in 1536, <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> was confiscated by the crown, and the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was established. A superintendent took the place of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and the incumbent has had the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> since the incorporation with Sweden in 1658.

<p>Eight years later, Charles X founded a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, solemnly opened in 1668. In 1676 the Danes gave bloody battle near Lund and made in 1709 another fruitless attempt to reconquer Skaane. Charles VII made Lund his head-quarters after his return from <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkey</a> in 1716-1718. In the course of its existence the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> has been threatened in several ways, but since the beginning of the nineteenth century it has not been imperilled. It comprises four faculties and received in 1878-82 the gift of a new building from the State. In 1908 there were about one hundred professors stationed there, the number of students being three hundred and twenty-two. A new <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was built in 1907. The famous poet, Esaias Tegn&eacute;r, lived there several years (1812-24) as professor of &aelig;sthetics and Greek and died in 1846 as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/16081a.htm">Vexi&ouml;</a>.
