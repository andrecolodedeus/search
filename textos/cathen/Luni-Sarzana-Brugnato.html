<h1>Luni-Sarzana-Brugnato</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the province of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. Luni (originally Luna) was an Etruscan city, but was seized by the Ligurians. At an uncertain date it was taken by the Romans under Domitius Calvinus. In 177 B.C., and under the Second Triumvirate, Roman colonies were established there. The port, though far from the city (the modern port of Spezia), was very important even in antiquity, and the marble of Luna, known today as Carrara marble was very renowned. In the fifth century Luna was sacked by the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, and in 650 by the Lombards. From the ninth century onwards is suffered the depredations of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, the last time in 1016 under Mogehit, who, however, was conquered the same year (8 June) by the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> and Pisan fleets. The city never recovered, however, and in 1058 the inhabitants <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to the modern Sarzana. Ruins are still visible of an amphitheatre, a semicircular theatre, a circus, and an aquarium. Numerous sixth century inscriptions, some of which are <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">Christian</a>, have been found at Luni. The sole record of its ancient importance survives in the name of Lunigiana. Sarzana (supposed to be derived from Sergiana) is a small city on the right bank of the River Magras, nearly four miles from the sea. It is first mentioned in 963. The temporal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Sarzana was vested in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Luni, though it was often contested by the Malaspina marquesses. Later it passed to the <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a>. In 1353 a congress of princes and representatives of the republics of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was held at Sarzana. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it was an important strategic point; the walls and bastions are still visible, while the citadel, which was erected in 1263 by the <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a> and destroyed and rebuilt by Lorenzo de'Medici (1488) and by Charles VIII (1496), serves today as a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was built after 1200, and was several times restored (1355, 1474, and in 1664 by Cardinal Calandrini). It contains pictures by Salimbene, Fiesella (called "Il Sarzana"), Balletti (Coronation of Frederick III), and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> by Baratta. The ceiling in carved wood is the work of Pietro Giambelli. In a precious <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> is preserved a lacrimatory in which, according to a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> legend, Nicodemus collected some drops of the Blood of Christ. The archives of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> contain the precious "Codex Pallavicinus", a collection of notarial documents and deeds made in 1226 by Bishop Guglielmo Pallavicino. The church of S. Francesco is also important.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> dates at least from the fifth century. In the sixth century St. Terentius and St. Venantius, a friend of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, flourished. Under Bishop Felerandus the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the Blood of Christ is said to have been brought to Luni. St. Ceccardus (892) was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by barbarians. When Luni was abandoned, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> was fixed at Sarzana, then at Sarzanello, and finally at Castelnuovo. In 1202 <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> transferred the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to Sarzana, Gualtiero being the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In 1306 <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> went to Sarzana, and succeeded in settling a dispute between Bishop Antonio Camulla and the Marquess Malaspina. The poet's sojourn here inspired a few "terzine" of the "Divine Comedy". In 1355 Charles IV conferred on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Luni the title of prince of the Holy Roman Empire, Antonio M. Parentuccelli (1495), a cousin of <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, built the episcopal palace and the church of S. Maria delle Grazie. Other illustrious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Cardinal Simone Pasqua (1561); Giovanni Selvaco (1590), the founder of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; Giulio Cesare Lomellino (1757), the reformer of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; Vincenzo M. Maggioli (1795), put to flight by the Jacobins. In 1787 the Diocese of Pontremoli, and in 1821 that of Massa Ducale were separated from Luni-Sarzana, but the Diocese of Brugnato, separated from Luni by <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> in 1133, was added in 1822. The diocese of Luni-Sarzana is directly subject to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, but Brugnato is a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>; the united diocese has 107 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with 165,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, 10 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men, and 25 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 6 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys and 8 for girls, and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> periodical.
