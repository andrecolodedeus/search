<h1>Lupus</h1>  

<p>(SERVATUS LUPUS, LOUP)

<p><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Ferri&egrave;res, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> writer, b. in the <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Diocese of Sens</a>, about 805; d. about 862. He assumed the surname of Servatus in commemoration of his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> escape from danger either in a serious illness or on the battlefield. He began his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="../cathen/06049d.htm">Ferri&egrave;res</a> under Aldric and completed it at <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> under <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a>. During his residence at <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> (c. 830-36) he became an intimate friend and disciple of the learned Einhard. Even before he returned to his native land he had become favourably known at court and was especially esteemed by the Empress Judith, the second wife of Louis the Pious. To her and her son Charles the Bald, whose political interests he always defended, he owed his <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Ferri&egrave;res (22 November, 840). Subsequently he took a prominent part in contemporary political and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> events, even assuming active command on the battlefield several times. During the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between Charles the Bald and Pepin of Aquitaine he was captured and held <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> for a short time (844). The same year he was sent to <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> to carry out the monastic reforms decreed by the Synod of Germigny (843), and attended the Council of Verneuil on the Oise, the Acts of which have been written by him. He was also present at several other councils, notably that of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> in 853, and played an important part in the contemporary controversy regarding <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. He believed in a twofold <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, not indeed in the sense that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> some men to damnation, but that he foreknew the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of men and foreordained consequent punishment. The closing years of the life of Lupus were saddened by the threatened devastation of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> by the invading Normans. He occupies a prominent place in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> literary history, being one of the most cultured and refined men of the ninth century. His letters, of which we possess 132, are distinguished for literary elegance and valuable historical information. As a hagiographer he has left us a "Life of St. Maximin", <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> (d. 349) and a "Life of St. Wigbert", <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Fritzlar in <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a> (d. 747). In the controversy on <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> he wrote his "De tribus quaestionibus", a work which treated of the threefold question of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, and the universality of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>. To illustrate the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on these topics he brought together pertinent passages from the Fathers in his "Collectaneum de tribus quaestionibus."
