<h1>Lutheranism</h1>  

<p>The religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> held by the oldest and in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the most numerous of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, founded by the <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> reformer, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Martin Luther</a>. The term <em>Lutheran</em> was first used by his opponents during the Leipzig Disputation in 1519, and afterwards became universally prevalent. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> preferred the designation "Evangelical", and today the usual title of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> is "Evangelical Lutheran Church". In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where the Lutherans and the Reformed have united (since 1817), the name Lutheran has been abandoned, and the state Church is styled the Evangelical or the Evangelical United.
<h2 id="section1">Distinctive teachings</h2>

<p>In <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> official Lutheranism is part of what is called <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, since it agrees with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and the Greek Churches in accepting the authority of the Scriptures and of the three most ancient creeds (the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02033b.htm">Athanasian Creed</a>). Besides these formul&aelig; of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, Lutheranism acknowledges six specific confessions which distinguish it from other churches: <ul><li>the unaltered Augsburg Confession (1530), <li>the Apology of the Augsburg Confession (1531), <li><a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> Large Catechism (1529), <li><a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> Catechism for Children (1529), <li>the Articles of Smalkald (1537), and <li>the Form of Concord (1577).</ul>

<p>These nine symbolical books (including the three Creeds) constitute what is known as the "Book of Concord", which was first published at <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a> in 1580 by order of Elector Augustus of Saxony (see PROTESTANT CONFESSIONS OF FAITH). In these confessions the Scriptures are declared to be the only <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>. The extent of the Canon is not defined, but the bibles in common use among Lutherans have been generally the same as those of other <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> (see CANON OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES). The symbols and the other writings not contained in Scripture do not possess decisive authority, but merely show how the Scriptures were understood and explained at particular times by the leading <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> (Form of Concord).

<p>The chief tenet of the Lutheran creed, that which <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> called "the article of the standing and falling Church", has reference to the <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> man. <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">Original sin</a> is explained as a positive and total depravity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which renders all the acts of the unjustified, even those of civil righteousness, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> and displeasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Justification, which is not an internal change, but an external, forensic declaration by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> imputes to the creature the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, comes only by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is the confidence that one is reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through Christ. Good works are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as an exercise of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and are rewarded, not by justification (which they presuppose), but by the fulfilment of the Divine promises (Apology Aug. Conf.).

<p>Other distinctive doctrines of the Lutheran Church are: <ul><li><a href="../cathen/04322a.htm">consubstantiation</a> (although the symbols do not use this term), i.e. the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">real, corporeal presence of Christ's Body and Blood</a> during the celebration of the Lord's Supper, in, with, and under the substance of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>, in a union which is not <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic</a>, nor of mixture, nor of local inclusion, but entirely transcendent and mysterious; <li>the omnipresence of the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is differently explained by the commentators of the Symbolical Books.</ul>

<p>Since the official formul&aelig; of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> claim no decisive authority for themselves, and on many points are far from harmonious, the utmost diversity of opinion prevails among Lutherans. Every shade of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> may be found among them, from the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, who hold fast to the confessions, to the semi-infidel <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, who deny the authority of the Scriptures.
<h2 id="section2">History</h2>

<p>Lutheranism dates from 31 October, 1517, when <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> affixed his theses to the church door of the castle of <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>. Although he did not break with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> until three years later, he had already come substantially to his later views on the plan of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. The new teachings, however underwent a great change after <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> return from Wartburg (1521). Before he died (18 Feb., 1546), his teachings had been propagated in many states of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, in the Baltic Provinces, in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, Transylvania, the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and Scandinavia. From these <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> countries Lutheranism has been carried by emigration to the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> it ranks among the leading <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>.
<h3 id="A">The Lutherans in Germany</h3>

<h4 id="i">First period: from the appearance of Luther's theses to the adoption of the Formula of Concord (1517-80)</h4>

<p>Favoured by the civil rulers, Lutheranism spread rapidly in Northern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. After the Diet of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a> (1526) the Elector of Saxony and other princes established Lutheran state Churches. An alliance between these princes was concluded at Torgau in 1526, and again at Smalkald in 1531. The Protestant League was continually increased by the accession of other states, and a religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> broke out in 1546, which resulted in the Peace of Augsburg (1555). This treaty provided that the Lutherans should retain permanently what they then possessed, but that all officials of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> estates, who from that time forth should go over to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> would be deposed and replaced by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. This latter provision, known as the "Reservatum Ecclesiasticum", was very unsatisfactory to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and its constant violation was one of the causes that lead up to the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> (1618-48). At the time of the Peace of Augsburg Lutherans predominated in the north of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglians</a> or Reformed were very numerous in the south. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and the territories subject to spiritual lords were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, although many of these afterwards became <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. Several attempts were made to effect a reunion. In 1534 <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a> invited the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> to a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> arranged conferences between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Lutheran <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> in 1541, 1546, and 1547. His successor, Ferdinand I (1556-64), and many private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> such as the Lutheran Frederick Staphylus and <a href="../cathen/04340b.htm">Father Contzen</a>, laboured much for the same end. All these efforts, however, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> fruitless. <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, Crusius, and other Lutheran <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> made formal proposals of union to the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> (1559, 1574, 1578), but nothing came of their overtures. From the beginning bitter hostility existed between the Lutherans and the Reformed. This first appeared in the Sacramentarian controversy between <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> (1524). They met in conference at Marburg in 1529, but came to no agreement. The hopes of union created by the compromise formula of 1536, known as the <em>Concordia Wittenbergensis</em>, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> delusive. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> continued to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on the <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglians</a> until his death. The Sacramentarian strife was renewed in 1549 when the <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglians</a> accepted <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> view of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence</a>. The followers of <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, who favoured <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> (Philippists, Crypto-Calvinists), were also furiously denounced by the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Lutherans. During these controversies the State Church of the Palatinate, where Philippism predominated, changed from the Lutheran to the Reformed <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (1560). From the beginning Lutheranism was torn by <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> disputes, carried on with the utmost <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and passion. They had reference to the questions of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and grace, <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the use of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, the Lord's Supper, and the Person and work of Christ. The bitterest controversy was the Crypto-Calvinistic. To effect harmony the Form of Concord, the last of the Lutheran symbols, was drawn up in 1577, and accepted by the majority of the state Churches. The document was written in a conciliatory spirit, but it secured the triumph of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> party.


<h4 id="ii">Second period: from the adoption of the Formula of Concord to the beginning of the Pietistic Movement (1580-1689)</h4>

<p>During this period Lutheranism was engaged in bitter polemics with its neighbours in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Out of these religious discords grew the horrors of the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>, which led many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to desire better relations between the churches. A "charitable colloquy" was held at Thorn in 1645 by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, Lutheran, and <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, but nothing was accomplished. The proposal of the Lutheran professor, George Calixtus, that the confessions organize into one church with the consensus of the first five centuries as a common basis (<a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">Syncretism</a>), aroused a storm of indignation, and, by way of protest, a creed was accepted by the Saxon <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> which expressed the views of the most radical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Lutheran <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> (1655). The Lutheran <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of this period imitated the disorderly arrangement of <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon's</a> "Loci Theologici", but in spirit they were with few exceptions loyal supporters of the Form of Concord. Although the writings of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> abound with diatribes against the speculative <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, his followers early perceived the necessity of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> for controversial purposes. <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> developed a system of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristoteleanism</a>, and it was not long before the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> method, which <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> had so cordially detested, was used by the Evangelical <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, although the new <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> was utterly different from the genuine system. Lutheran dogmatics became a maze of refined subtleties, and mere logomachy was considered the chief <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>. The result was a fanatical <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, whose only activity was heresy-hunting and barren controversy. New attempts were made to unite the Evangelical Churches. Conferences were held in 1586, 1631, and 1661; a plan of union was proposed by the Heidelberg professor Pareus (1615); the Reformed Synod of Charenton (1631) voted to admit Lutheran sponsors in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. But again the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Lord's Supper <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> an obstacle, as the Lutherans would agree to no union that was not based upon perfect dogmatic consensus. By the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> (1648) the concessions which had been made to the Lutherans in 1555 were extended to the Reformed.

<h4 id="iii">Third period: from the beginning of the Pietistic Movement to the Evangelical Union (1689-1817)</h4>

<p>Pietism, which was a reaction against the cold and dreary formalism of Lutheran <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, originated with Philip Spener (1635-1705). In sermons and writings he asserted the claims of personal <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and in 1670, while dean at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort-on-the-Main</a>, he began to hold little reunions called <em>collegia pietatis</em> (whence the name <a href="../cathen/12080c.htm">Pietist</a>), in which devotional passages of the Scriptures were explained and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> conversation carried on by those present. His follower, August Francke, founded in 1694 the University of Halle, which became a stronghold of <a href="../cathen/12080c.htm">Pietism</a>. The strict Lutherans accused the <a href="../cathen/12080c.htm">Pietists</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, a charge which was vigorously denied, although in fact the new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> differed from the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> not only in practice, but also in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. The first enthusiasm of the <a href="../cathen/12080c.htm">Pietists</a> soon degenerated into fanaticism, and they rapidly lost favour. <a href="../cathen/12080c.htm">Pietism</a> had exercised a beneficial influence, but it was followed by the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalistic</a> movement, a more radical reaction against <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, which effected within the Lutheran, as in other <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> communions, many apostasies from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian belief</a>. The philosophy of the day and the national literature, then ardently cultivated, had gradually undermined the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of all classes of the people. The leaders in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> adjusted themselves to the new conditions, and soon <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> chairs and the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpits</a> were filled by men who rejected not only the dogmatic teaching of the Symbolical Books, but every <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> element of religion. A notable exception to this growing infidelity was the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of Herrnhuters or United Brethren, founded in 1722 by Count von Zinzendorf, a follower of the <a href="../cathen/12080c.htm">Pietistic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02616a.htm">BOHEMIAN BRETHREN</a>). The critical state of their churches caused many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> to long for a union between the Lutherans and the Reformed. The royal house of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> laboured to accomplish a union, but all plans were frustrated by the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. There were for a time prospects of a reconciliation of the <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanoverian</a> Lutherans with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Negotiations were carried on between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14216c.htm">Bishop Spinola</a> and the Lutheran representative Molanus (1691). A controversy on the points at issue followed between <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> and Leibniz (1692-1701), but no agreement was reached.

<h4 id="iv">Fourth period: from the Evangelical Union (1817) to the present</h4>

<p>The chief events in the Lutheran Churches in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> during the nineteenth century were the Evangelical Union and the revival of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. During the celebration of the tercentenary of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in 1817, efforts were made in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> to unite Lutherans and Reformed. Frederick William III recommended the use of a common liturgy by the two churches, and this proposal gradually won acceptance. There was much opposition, however, to the service-book published by royal authority in 1822. John Scheibel, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> in <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, refused to accept it, and, being deposed from office, founded a separatist <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> known as the "Old Lutherans" (1830). The Government used very oppressive measures against these nonconformists, but in 1845 the new king, Frederick William IV, recognized them as an independent Lutheran <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. In 1860 the Old Lutherans were greatly reduced in numbers by the defection of Pastor Diedrich, who organized the independent Immanuel Synod. There were also separatist movements outside of <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>. Free Lutheran Churches were established by dissenters in <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, and Saxony. A supernaturalist movement, which defended the Divinely inspired character of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, started a reaction against the principle of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The centenary jubilees of 1817 and the following years, which recalled the early days of Lutheranism, brought with them a revival of former <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculties of several <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> became strictly Lutheran in their teachings. Since then there has been a persistent and bitter struggle between <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> and Evangelical tendencies in the United and Free Churches.
<h3 id="B">The Lutherans in Denmark and Scandinavia</h3>

<h4 id="i">Denmark</h4>

<p>By the Union of Calmar (1397), <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> became a united kingdom under the King of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. The despotic Christian II (1513-23) endeavoured to introduce the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, but was overthrown by his barons. Frederick I of Schleswig-Holstein, his successor, openly professed Lutheranism in 1526. At the Diet of <a href="../cathen/16064d.htm">Odense</a> (1527) he obtained a measure which guaranteed equal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to his coreligionists, and two years later he proclaimed Lutheranism the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. Under his successor, Christian III (1533-59), the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were deprived of their sees, and the Lutheran Church of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> was organized with the king as supreme <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The Diet of Copenhagen (1546) enacted <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a>, which deprived <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and forbade <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to remain in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> under pain of death. The opposition of <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Iceland</a> to the new religion was put down by force (1550). German <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> was propagated in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> by Clausen. Among its opponents was Grundtvig, leader of the Grundtvigian movement (1824), which advocated the acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostles' Creed</a> as the sole <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>. Freedom of religious worship was granted in 1849.

<h4 id="ii">Norway</h4>

<p>Norway, which was united with <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, became Lutheran during the reigns of Frederick I and Christian III. <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>, introduced from <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, made great progress in <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>. It was opposed by Hauge and by <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegian</a> followers of Grundtvig. A Free Apostolic Church was founded by Adolph Lammers about 1850, but later reunited with the state church. <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> passed <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of toleration in 1845, but still excludes the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>.

<h4 id="iii">Sweden</h4>

<p>Sweden was freed from the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> yoke by Gustavus Vasa in 1521, and two years later the liberator was chosen king. Almost from the outset of his reign he showed himself favourable to Lutherans, and by cunning and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> succeeded in introducing the new religion into his kingdom. In 1529 the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was formally established by the Assembly of Orebro, and in 1544 the ancient Faith was put under the ban of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. The reign of Eric XIV (1560-8) was marked by violent conflicts between the Lutherans and the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>. The latter party was favoured by the king, and their defeat in 1568 was followed by Eric's dethronement. His successor, John III (1568-92), conferred with <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> on a reunion of <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but, as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> could not grant all the concessions demanded by the king, the negotiations were unsuccessful. The next king, Sigismund (1592-1604), was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, but, as he lived in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (of which he was king from 1587), the Government of Sweden was administered by his uncle Duke Charles of Sudermanland, a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> Lutheran, who used the power at his command to secure his proclamation as King Charles IX in the Assembly of Nordkoeping (1604). The successor of Charles was the famous general and statesman, Gustavus Adolphus (1611-32). For the part he took in the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>, he is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> by Lutherans as the religious hero of their Church, but it is now admitted that reasons of state led Gustavus into that conflict. He was succeeded by his only daughter Christina, who <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and abdicated in 1654. By a law of 1686 all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the kingdom were required under severe penalties to conform to the state Church. A law passed in 1726 against religious conventicles was rigidly enforced against the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> <a href="../cathen/12080c.htm">Pietists</a> (<em>L&auml;sare</em>) from 1803 till its repeal in 1853. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> against religious dissidents was not removed from the statute books till 1873. The <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> Church is entirely controlled by the state, and the strict <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> which was enforced prevented at first any serious inroads of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>. But since 1866 there has formed within the state Church a "progressive party", whose purpose is to abandon all symbols and to laicize the church. The two <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of Upsala and Lund are <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. The Grand Duchy of Finland, formerly united to <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, but now (since 1809) a Province of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, maintains Lutheranism as the national Church.
<h3 id="C">Lutheranism in other countries of Europe</h3>

<h4 id="i">Poland</h4>

<p>Lutheranism was introduced into <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> during the reign of Sigismund I (1501-48) by young men who had made their studies at <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>. The new teachings were opposed by the king, but had the powerful support of the nobility. From Danzig they spread to the cities of Thorn and Elbing, and, during the reign of Sigismund II (1548-72), steadily gained ground. A union symbol was drawn up and signed by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> at <a href="../cathen/13436b.htm">Sandomir</a> in 1570, and three years later they concluded a religious peace with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, in which it was agreed that all parties should enjoy equal civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. The peace was not lasting, and during two centuries there was almost continual <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> strife which finally led to the downfall of the kingdom. With the connivance of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, Lutheranism was established in the territories of the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a>, East Prussia (1525), Livonia (1539), and Courland (1561).

<h4 id="ii">Hungary, Transylvania and Silesia</h4>

<p>The teachings of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> were first propagated in these countries during the reign of King Louis II of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> (1516-26). The king was strongly opposed to religious innovation, but after his death civil discords enabled the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> to gain headway. In Silesia Lutheranism was protected by the dukes, and in 1524 it was established in <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, the capital, by the municipal council. Freedom of worship was granted in <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> in 1545, and in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> in 1606. The Lutherans were soon involved in quarrels with the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>. The German element among the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> favoured the Augsburg Confession, but the Reformed <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had more adherents among the Hungarians and Czechs. In Silesia the Lutherans themselves were divided on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of justification and the Eucharist. Gaspar Schwenkfeld (died 1561), one of the earliest disciples of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, assailed his master's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on these points, and as early as 1528 <a href="../cathen/13597a.htm">Schwenkfeldianism</a> had many adherents among Lutherans. The memory of Schwenkfeld is still held in veneration in <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a> and in some Lutheran communities of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. Lutheranism made some gains in the hereditary states of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> during the reigns of Ferdinand 1 (1556-64) and Maximilian II (1564-76). The Lutherans of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> rebelled against the imperial authority in 1618, but were defeated, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> was preserved in the Hapsburg dominions. (See <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN MONARCHY</a>; <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">HUNGARY</a>.)

<h4 id="iii">Holland</h4>

<p>Holland was one of the first countries to receive the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>, anxious to avert the disorders which followed the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, used great severity against those who propagated Lutheranism in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. His son, <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a> (1556-98), was still more rigorous. The measures he employed were often despotic and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, and the people rose in a rebellion (1568), by which <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> was lost to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Meanwhile the relations between the Lutherans and <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> were anything but cordial. The Reformed party gradually gained the ascendancy, and, when the republic was established, their political supremacy enabled them to subject the Lutherans to many annoying restrictions. The <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Lutherans fell a prey to <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> in the eighteenth century. A number of the churches and <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> separated from the main body to adhere more closely to the Augsburg Confession. The liberal party has a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> (founded in 1816) at <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> provide for <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> training by lectures in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of the same city.
<h3 id="D">Lutherans in America</h3>

<h4 id="i">Period of foundation (1624-1742)</h4>

<p>Lutherans were among the earliest <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> settlers on this continent. Their first representatives came from <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> colony of New Netherlands about 1624. Under Governor Stuyvesant they were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to conform to the Reformed services, but freedom of worship was obtained when <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New Amsterdam</a> (New York) was captured by the English in 1664. The second distinct body of Lutherans in America arrived from <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> in 1637. Two years later they had a minister and organized at Fort Christina (now Wilmington, Delaware), the first Lutheran congregation in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>. After 1771 the Swedes of Delaware and <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> dissolved their union with the Mother Church of Sweden. As they had no English-speaking <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, they chose their <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> from the Episcopalian Church. Since 1846 these congregations have declared full communion with the <a href="../cathen/12493a.htm">Episcopalians</a>. The first colony of German Lutherans was from the Palatinate. They arrived in 1693 and founded Germantown, now a part of Philadelphia. During the eighteenth century large numbers of Lutheran emigrants from Alsace, the Palatinate, and <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a> settled along the Hudson River. On the Atlantic coast, in <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>, <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, North and South Carolina, were many isolated groups of German Lutherans. A colony of Lutherans from <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> founded the settlement of Ebenezer, <a href="../cathen/06460a.htm">Georgia</a>, in 1734. In Eastern <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> about 30,000 German Lutherans had settled before the middle of the eighteenth century. Three of their congregations applied to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> for <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, and Count Zinzendorf became <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> in Philadelphia in 1741.

<h4 id="ii">Period of organization (1742-87)</h4>

<p>In 1742 Rev. Henry Muhlenberg, a <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanoverian</a> who is regarded as the patriarch of American Lutheranism, arrived in Philadelphia and succeeded Zinzendorf in the pastorate. During the forty-five years of his ministry in America, Muhlenberg presided over widely separated congregations and erected many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>. He began the work of organization among the Lutherans of America by the foundation of the Synod of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> in 1748. He also prepared the congregational constitution of St. Michael's Church, Philadelphia, which became the model of similar constitutions throughout the country. His son, Rev. Frederick Muhlenberg, afterwards speaker in the first House of Representatives, was the originator of the Ministerium of New York, the second synod in America (1773).

<h4 id="iii">Period of deterioration (1787-1817)</h4>

<p>Muhlenherg and the other German <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> of his time were graduates of the University of Halle. The generation that succeeded them had made their studies in the same institution. But the <a href="../cathen/12080c.htm">Pietism</a> of the founders of Halle had now made way for the destructive criticism of Semler. The result was soon manifest in the indifferentism of the American Churches. The <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> Ministerium eliminated all confessional tests in its constitution of 1792. The New York ministerium, led by Dr. Frederick Quitman, a decided <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalist</a>, substituted for the older Lutheran catechisms and hymn-books works that were more conformable to the prevailing <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. The agenda, or service-book adopted by the <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> Lutherans in 1818, was a departure from the old type of service and the expression of new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> standards. The transition from the use of German to English caused splits in many congregations, the German party bitterly opposing the introduction of English in the church services. They even felt that they had more in common with the German-speaking Reformed than with the English-speaking Lutherans, and some of them advocated an Evangelical Union such as was then proposed in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>.

<h4 id="iv">Period of revival and expansion (1817-60)</h4>

<p>To prevent the threatened disintegration, a union of all the Lutheran <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> in America was proposed. In 1820 the General Synod was organized at Hagerstown, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, but a few of the district <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> stood aloof. The new organization was regarded with suspicion by many, and in 1823 the mother synod of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> itself withdrew from the general body. From the beginning there was a considerable element within the General Synod which favoured <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> compromise with the Reformed Church. To strengthen the conservative party, the <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> Synod returned to the General Synod in 1853. Meanwhile the General Synod had established the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Gettysburg, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> (1825), and <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> for home and foreign missions. In the West several <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organizations were formed by Lutheran emigrants from <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and the Scandinavian countries. The Missouri Synod was founded by Rev. Carl Walther in 1847, and the same year opened a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at St. Louis. A band of Old Lutherans, who resisted the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> union, <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> from <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a> in 1839, and two years later founded the Buffalo Synod. At first a union between the Missouri and the Buffalo <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> was expected, but instead their leaders were soon engaged in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> controversies which extended over many years. In 1854 a party within the Missouri Synod, dissatisfied with what it regarded as the extreme congregationalism of that body and its denial of open questions in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, seceded and formed the <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a> Synod with its <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>. Ever since there has been conflict between these two <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. Travelling preachers of the <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> Ministerium founded in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> a conference in connexion with the mother synod in 1805. This conference was reorganized in 1818 into a synod which since 1833 has been known as the Joint Synod of <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. The earliest <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> formed by Scandinavian emigrants were: <ul><li>the <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegian</a> Hauge Synod (1846), <li>the <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegian</a> Synod (1863), and <li>the Scandinavian Augustana Synod (1860),</ul>

<p>all in the states of the Middle West.

<h4 id="v">Period of reorganization (since 1860)</h4>

<p>At the beginning of the Civil War the General Synod numbered two-thirds of the Lutherans in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and hopes were entertained that soon all the organizations would be united in one body. These anticipations, however, were doomed to disappointment. In 1863 the General Synod lost the five southern district <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, which withdrew and formed the "General Synod of the Confederate States". A more serious break in the General Synod occurred three years later. The disagreements between the liberal and the conservative elements in that body had not abated with time. In 1864 the Ministerium of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> established in Philadelphia a new <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, thereby greatly reducing the attendance at the Gettysburg <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the General Synod. At the next convention (1866) it was declared that the <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> Synod was no longer in practical union with the General Synod. The <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> Ministerium at once sent out an invitation to all American and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> to join with it in forming a new general body. In response to this invitation a convention assembled at <a href="../cathen/12673a.htm">Reading</a> the same year, and thirteen <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were consolidated into the "General Council". With the close of the Civil War the Southern Lutherans might have returned to fellowship with their Northern brethren, but the controversy between the Northern <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> determined them to perpetuate their own organization. In 1886 they reorganized their general body, taking the name of the "United Synod in the South", and stating their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> position, which is essentially the same as that of the General Council. A fourth general body was formed in 1872, the "Synodical Conference", at present the strongest organization among the Lutheran Churches of America. It takes as its basis the Formula of Concord of 1580, and comprises the Missouri and other Western <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. A controversy on <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> led to the withdrawal of the Ohio Synod in 1881, and of the <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegian</a> Synod in 1884. There are still many independent <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> not affiliated with any of the general organizations. Thus the Lutherans of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> are divided into various conflicting bodies, each claiming to be a truer exponent of Lutheranism than the others. The membership of the four principal organizations is almost exclusively of German descent. The main cause of separation is diversity of opinion regarding the importance or the interpretation of the official confessions.
<h2 id="section3">Organization and worship</h2>

<p>In the early days of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the prevalent form of government was that known as the episcopal, which transferred the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to the civil ruler. It was followed by the territorial system, which recognized the sovereign as head of the church, in virtue of his office, both in administrative and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> matters. The collegial system of Pfaff (1719) asserts the sovereignty and independence of the congregation, which may, however, delegate its authority to the State. In the Lutheran state Churches the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> is in fact the supreme authority. The practical determination of religious questions rests with the national legislature, or with a consistorium whose members are appointed by the government. No Divinely constituted <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> is recognized, and in orders all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are considered as equals. The Lutheran <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Sweden and <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, like the "general superintendents" of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, are government officials entrusted with the oversight of the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and congregations. In <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, as among the Free Churches of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the form of organization is synodical, a system of church polity which in its main features has been derived from the Reformed Church. According to this plan, purely congregational matters are decided by the vote of the congregation, either directly or through the church council. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the church council consists of the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and his lay assistants, the elders and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, all chosen by the congregation. Affairs of more general importance and disputed questions are settled by the district synod, composed of lay and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> delegates representing such congregations as have accepted a mutual congregational compact. The congregations composing a district synod may unite with other district <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> to form a more general body. The powers of a general organization of this kind, in relation to the bodies of which it is composed, are not, however, in all cases the same. The constitution of the Old Lutheran Church in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> makes its General Synod the last court of appeal and its decisions binding. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> a different conception prevails, and in most instances the general assemblies are regarded simply as advisory conferences whose decisions require the ratification of the particular organizations represented.

<p>Lutheran public worship is based on the service-book which <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> published in 1523 and 1526. He retained the first part of the Mass, but abolished the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>, Canon, and all the forms of sacrifice. The main Lutheran service is still known as "the Mass" in Scandinavian countries. The singing of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> became a prominent part of the new service. Many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sequences were retained, and other sacred songs were borrowed from the old German poets. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> himself wrote <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, but it is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether he is really the author of any of the melodies that are usually ascribed to him. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> wished to retain the <a href="../cathen/05380b.htm">Elevation</a> and the use of the Latin language, but these have been abandoned. The Collect, Epistle, and Gospel vary according to the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> of the year. The Creed is followed by a sermon on the Scripture lesson of the day, which is the principal part of the service. Ordinarily the Lord's Supper is administered only a few times during the year. It is preceded, sometimes the day before, by the service of public confession and <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, which consists in the promise of amendment made by the intending communicants, and the declaration of the minister that such as are truly penitent are forgiven. Only two <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are recognized by Lutherans, Baptism and the Lord's Supper; but Confirmation, Ordination, and Confession as just described are regarded as sacred rites. There are also ceremonies prescribed for marriage and burial. <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, Pentecost, the feast of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a>, the Commemoration of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> (31 Oct.) are observed with religious services. Pictures are permitted in the churches, and in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> vestments and lighted candles are used at the communion service. The first complete ritual or agenda was that prepared for the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> in 1525. There is no uniform liturgy for the churches. In the United Evangelical Church of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the agenda of Frederick William III (1817) is the official form. The services of the American Lutherans were for many years chiefly extemporaneous, but since 1888 a common service based on the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> of the sixteenth century has been used by almost all English-speaking Lutherans in this country. It includes, besides the main service, <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">matins</a> and vespers.
<h2 id="section4">Various Lutheran activities</h2>
<h3 id="A">Foreign missions and benevolent organizations</h3>

<p>Foreign missionary activity has never been a very prominent characteristic of the Lutheran Church. Its pioneer missionaries went from the University of Halle to the East Indies (Tanquebar) at the invitation of Frederick IV of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> in 1705. During the eighteenth century Halle sent about sixty missionaries to Tanquebar. In later years the mission was supplied by the Leipzig Lutheran Mission. Another <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> mission was that of Pastor Hans Egede among the <a href="../cathen/06777b.htm">Greenlanders</a> in 1721. During the nineteenth century several <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> for foreign missions were founded: the Berlin Mission Society (1824), the Evangelical Lutheran Missionary Association of Leipzig (1836), the Hermansburg Society (1854), and a number of similar organizations in the Scandinavian countries. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> a German Foreign Missionary Society was founded in 1837. The first Lutheran missionary from the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was Dr. Heyer, who was sent to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> in 1841. At present missions to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> in Oceania, <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and East Africa, are maintained under the auspices of various American <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. The sisterhood, known as the Lutheran Deaconesses, was founded by Pastor Fliedner at Kaiserwerth in 1833, its objects being the care of the sick, instruction, etc. They are now very numerous in some parts of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. They were introduced in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in 1849.
<h3 id="B">Sacred learning and education</h3>

<p>The study of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetics</a>, <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> has been much cultivated by Lutheran scholars. Among the <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetes</a> the following are well known: Solomon Glassius (Philologia Sacra, 1623); Sebastian Schmid (died 1696), translator and commentator; John H. Michaelis (Biblia Hebraica, 1720); John A. Bengel (Gnomon Novi Testamenti, 1752); Havernick (died 1845), Hegstenberg (died 1869), and Delitzsch (died 1890), commentators. Among the more important church historians may be mentioned: Mosheim (died 1755), sometimes called the "Father of Modern Church History", Schrockle (died 1808), Neander (died 1850), Kurtz (died 1890), Hase (died 1890). The "Magdeburg Centuries" (1559) of Flacius Illyricus and his associates, the first <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> written by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, is very biased and has no historical value. Numerous dogmatic works have been written by Lutheran <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. Among the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmaticians</a> most esteemed by Lutherans are: <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, whose "Loci Theologici" (1521) was the first Lutheran <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>; Martin Chemnitz (died 1586) and John Gerhard (died 1637), the two ablest Lutheran <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>; Calovius (died 1686), champion of the strictest Lutheran <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>; Quenstedt (died 1688); Hollaz (died 1713); Luthardt (died 1902); Henry Schmid, whose <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> (1st ed., 1843) in its English translation has been much used in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The Lutheran Church still produces many dogmatic works, but very few of the modern divines hold strictly to the old formul&aelig; of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>The Lutheran Churches deserve great credit for the importance they have always attached to religious instruction, not only in their many <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, but also and especially in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of elementary instruction. In Lutheran countries the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the children is supervised by the religious authorities, since Lutherans act on the principle that religious training is the most important part of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, Biblical study, and <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a> have a prominent part in the everyday instruction. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> has been developed with great success among the congregations that still use the German and Scandinavian languages. The Lutherans of <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a> and Illinois co-operated with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in 1890 in an organized resistance against legislation which would have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> injurious to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.
<h2 id="section5">Influence of Rationalism in the Lutheran churches</h2>

<p>The popular <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had been overthrown in the eighteenth century by the philosophy of Wolff (died 1754) and the criticism of Semler (died 1791). The principle of the supremacy of reason was used to tear down <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the inspired character of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. The literature and philosophy of the time show how great a blow was dealt to <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Lutheranism. Theology, now become the handmaid of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, eagerly accepted amid the prevailing <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> and negation the system of <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> (died 1804), which made the essence of religion and the whole value of Scripture consist in the teaching of the morality of reason or natural ethics. Against this <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> there arose about the beginning of the nineteenth century two reactionary movements &mdash; Supernaturalism, which declared in favour of the undivided supremacy of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the system of Schleiermacher (died 1834), which made sentiment or the feelings of the heart the criterion of religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The teachings of Schleiermacher recast the existing <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, and gave it the bent which it afterwards followed. A still more thoroughgoing <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> appeared in the writings of the <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegelian</a> Strauss (died 1874) and of the T&uuml;bingen <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which aimed at the utter destruction of the Divine basis of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a> by explaining all that is <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> in Scripture as merely natural or mythical. These bold attacks were met by many able scholars, and they have long since been discredited. Since the days of Strauss and Bauer (died 1860), the method known as Higher Criticism (see BIBLICAL CRITICISM) has found favour in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, both with the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. Much that is of permanent value as an aid to the scientific study of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> has been accomplished, but at the same time <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> has been making constant gains, not only in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, but also amongst the masses. The strictly confessional <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> revival (1817), the neo-Lutheran movement, whose leanings toward the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> gave it the name of German <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Puseyism</a>, the Compromise Theology, which endeavoured to reconcile believers and <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> &mdash; all these more or less conservative systems are now to a great extent superseded by the modern or free <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, represented by Pfieiderer (died 1906), Wilhelm Hermann, Tr&ouml;ltsch, Harnack, Weinel, and others, which teaches a religion without creed or <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, especially in the cities, the Evangelical <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has lost its influence not only with the people, but in great part with the preachers themselves. The same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to some extent in the Scandinavian countries, where <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> is making inroads on Lutheran <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the Lutherans have been more conservative, and thus far have preserved more of their confessional spirit.
<h2 id="section6">Statistics</h2>

<p>The number of Lutherans in the world is about fifty millions, a membership which far exceeds that of any other <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> denomination. The chief Lutheran country today, as from the beginning, is <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In 1905 the Evangelicals (Lutherans and Reformed) in the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> numbered 37,646,852. The membership of the Lutheran churches in other <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> countries is as follows: Sweden (1900), 5,972,792; <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, chiefly in <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a> and the Baltic Provinces (1905), 3,572,653; <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> (1901), 2,400,000; <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> (1900) 2,197,318; <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (1906), 1,288,942. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> have about 494,000 and 110,000 Lutherans respectively. According to a bulletin of the Bureau of the U.S. Census the total membership of the 24 Lutheran bodies in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in 1906 was 2,112,494, with 7841 <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, 11,194 church edifices, and <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> valued at $74,826 389 Dr. H. K. Carroll's statistics of the Churches of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> for 1909 credits the Lutherans with 2,173,047 communicants.
