<h1>Lu&#231;on</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of Lu&ccedil;on (Lucionensis).

<p>Embraces the Department of La Vend&eacute;e. It was suppressed by the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a> and annexed to the <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">Diocese of La Rochelle</a>; however, its re-establishment was urged upon in the Concordat of 1817 and came into effect in 1821. The new Diocese of Lu&#231;on comprised the territory of the ancient diocese (minus a few <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> incorporated in the <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Diocese of Nantes</a>) and almost all the former Diocese of Maillezais.
<h2>Diocese of Lu&ccedil;on</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Lu&#231;on was founded in 682 by Ansoald, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, who placed it under the government of St. Philbert (616-684). The latter, being expelled from Jumi&#232;ges, established the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Black Benedictines</a> on the Isle of Her (Noirmoutiers), of which Lu&#231;on was at first a dependency, probably as a <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>. The list of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of Lu&#231;on begins about the middle of the eleventh century. In 1317 <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> erected the Bishopric of Lu&#231;on and among the occupants of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were Nicolas C&aelig;ur (1441-51), brother of the celebrated financier Jacques C&aelig;ur; Cardinal Jean de Lorraine (1523-4); Cardinal Louis de Bourbon (1524-7); Jacques Duplessis-Richelieu (1584-92); and <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Armand Duplessis-Richelieu</a>, the famous <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> (1606-23); <a href="../cathen/04096a.htm#II">Nicolas Colbert</a>, brother of the <a href="../cathen/04096a.htm#I">great minister</a> (1661-71); De Mercy (1775-90), who <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> and became illustrious through the excellent instructions sent to his priests; and Ren&eacute;-Fran&#231;ois Soyer (1821-45), famed for the activity with which, even as a young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he had assumed various disguises and, during the most perilous hours of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> exercised his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions in the suburbs of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>. Bishop Soyer had for a very short time as his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> the <a href="../cathen/01180a.htm">Abb&eacute; Affre</a>, who subsequently, as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, fell in 1848 on the barricades in an effort to make peace.
<h2>Diocese of Maillezais</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Maillezais was founded about 989 by Gauzbert, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Julien de Tours, urged thereto by William IV, Duke of Aquitaine, and his wife Emma. Abbot Pierre (about 1100), who followed Richard C&aelig;ur de Lion to the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, composed two books on the construction and transfer of the Abbey of Maillezais. In 1317 <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> erected the Bishopric of Maillezais and among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Guillaume de Luc&eacute; (1421-38) and Thibaud de Luc&eacute; (1438-55), political counsellors of Charles VII, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1631 <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, with a view to a more active struggle against <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, transferred the residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maillezais to Fontenay-le-Comte; in 1648 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> itself was suppressed by <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> and its territory annexed to the Aunis district and the Isle of R&eacute;, both of which had been detached from the Diocese of Saintes in order to form that of <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a>; this condition lasted until 1821. Besides St. Philbert the principal <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in the Diocese of Lu&#231;on are: St. Benedict of Aizenay, a contemporary of St. Hilary, the apostle of Bas Poitou (fourth century); <a href="../cathen/09482a.htm">St. Macarius</a>, disciple of St. Martin, apostle of the land of the Mauges (fourth century); St. Viventianus (d. 413); and St. Martin of Vertou (d. 601), apostle of the country of the Herbauges; St. Florent, of the Isle of Yeu, disciple of St. Martin and founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Hilaire on the Isle of Yeu (fourth century); St. Lienne, disciple of St. Hilary, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Hilaire le Grand of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, in whose <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was erected at La-Roche-sur-Yon (fourth century); St. Senoch of Tiffauges, <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> and <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">miracle-worker</a> (sixth century); <a href="../cathen/01380b.htm">St. Amandus</a>, of the Isle of Yeu (d. 675), <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at St. Hilaire on the Isle of Yeu and later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maastricht; <a href="../cathen/15486a.htm">St. Vitalis</a> or Viaud, <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> (seventh or eighth century); <a href="../cathen/01126b.htm">St. Adalard</a> who died at Noirmoutiers and, because of his virtue, was called by his contemporaries "Antoine des Gaules"; and Blessed Louis-Marie-Grignion de Montfort (1673-1716).

<p>Rabelais was a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> at Fontenay-le-Comte and a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Maillezais and was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with the friendship of Geoffroy d'Estissac (1518-43), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maillezais. The Diocese of Lu&#231;on was <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> disturbed at the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. In 1568 a canon who fortified himself in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and sustained a long siege against the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, was captured and hanged, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who had shut themselves up in the church with him were massacred. During the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was the centre of the War of La Vend&eacute;e. The chief places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> are: Notre-Dame de Garreau in the Hermier <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, visited probably by Louis XIII at the time of his <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>; La Sainte Famille du Ch&#234;ne at La Rabateli&#232;re (since 1874); since the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> of Grignion de Montfort (22 January, 1888) his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> and the calvary that he established at Saint-Laurent sur S&#232;vre, attract over 20,000 <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> yearly.

<p>The Diocese of Lu&#231;on was the nursery of very important congregations; among the congregations of men dispersed by the Association law of 1901, the following merit mention: the Missionary Priests of the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a> (Compagnie de Marie); and the <a href="../cathen/06330b.htm">Christian Brothers of St. Gabriel</a> (Fr&#232;res de l'instruction chr&eacute;tienne de Saint Gabriel) founded in 1705 at Saint-Laurent-sur-S&#232;vre by Blessed Louis-Marie-Grignion de Montfort and whose numbers increased greatly since 1820 under the direction of P&#232;re Gabriel Deshayes. In 1901 the Missionary Priests had establishments in ten <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, also in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and Haiti, while the brothers, devoted to teaching, had a membership of 1420 and 165 establishments, some of them in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and the French Congo. There were also the Sons of Mary Immaculate (Enfants de Marie Immacul&eacute;e), missionaries and teachers, founded early in the nineteenth century at Chavagnes en Paillers by Venerable Louis-Marie Baudouin, with missionary houses in the English Antilles. Among the congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> we must mention: Sisters of Christian Union (S&aelig;urs de l'Union chr&eacute;tienne), a teaching order founded in 1630 by Marie Lumague with a mother-house at Fontenay-le-Comte; <a href="../cathen/15668a.htm">Daughters of Wisdom</a> (Filles de la Sagesse), devoted to nursing and teaching, founded in 1703 by Blessed Grignion de Montfort and having in 1901 a membership of 4800, with 360 establishments in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and 43 in Haiti; <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> of Jesus (<a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> de J&eacute;sus), a teaching order founded in 1802 at Chavagnes en Paillers by Venerable Louis-Marie Baudouin with houses in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and of Mary (S&aelig;urs du Sacr&eacute; C&aelig;ur de J&eacute;sus et de Marie), teachers, founded by the Abb&eacute; Moreau in 1818, with mother-house at Mormaison to which in 1900 were subject over 1033 members in 154 institutions.

<p>At the end of 1907 there remained in the diocese eleven <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. At the close of the nineteenth century the diocese could boast of the following establishments conducted by religious: 42 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a>, 5 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 1 alms-house, 15 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or hospices, and 13 communities for the care of the sick in their homes. At the end of 1907 the Diocese of Lu&#231;on had a population of 441,311, 36 canonical <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 262 "succursales" <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 154 curacies, 12 chapels-of-ease, and 633 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.
