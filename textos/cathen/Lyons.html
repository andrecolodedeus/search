<h1>Lyons</h1>  

<p>The Archdiocese of Lyons (Lugdunensis) comprises the Department of the Rh&ocirc;ne (except the Canton of Villeurbanne, which belongs to the <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Diocese of Grenoble</a>) and of the Loire. The <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a> assigned as the boundaries of the Archdiocese of Lyons the Departments of the Rh&ocirc;ne, the Loire, and the Ain and as suffragans the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/10180a.htm">Mende</a>, <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03566c.htm">Chamb&eacute;ry</a>. The Archdiocese of Lyons was authorized by Letters Apostolic of 29 November, 1801, to unite with his title the titles of the suppressed <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> Sees of Vienne and Embrun (see <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">G<font size=-2>RENOBLE</font></a>; <a href="../cathen/06378a.htm">G<font size=-2>AP</font></a>). In 1822 the Department of Ain was separated from the Archdiocese of Lyons to form the <a href="../cathen/02415a.htm">Diocese of Belley</a>; the title of the suppressed church of Embrun was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Archdiocese of Aix</a>, and the Archdiocese of Lyons and Vienne had henceforth as suffragans Langres, <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, St. Claude, and <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>It appears to have been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by Mgr Duchesne, despite the local traditions of many Churches, that in all three parts of Gaul in the second century there was but a single organized Church, that of Lyons. The "Deacon of Vienne", <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at Lyons during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of 177, was probably a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> installed at Vienne by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority of Lyons. The confluence of the Rh&ocirc;ne and the Sa&ocirc;ne, where sixty Gallic tribes had erected the famous altar to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Augustus, was also the centre from which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was gradually propagated throughout Gaul. The presence at Lyons of numerous <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and their almost daily communications with the Orient were likely to arouse the susceptibilities of the Gallo-Romans. A <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> arose under <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a>. Its victims at Lyons numbered forty-eight, half of them of Greek origin, half Gallo-Roman, among others <a href="../cathen/02594a.htm">St. Blandina</a>, and St. Pothinus, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lyons, sent to Gaul by <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a> about the middle of the second century. The legend according to which he was sent by St. Clement dates from the twelfth century and is without foundation. The letter addressed to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and Phrygia in the name of the faithful of Vienne and Lyons, and relating the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of 177, is considered by Ernest Renan as one of the most extraordinary documents possessed by any literature; it is the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> certificate of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The successor of St. Pothinus was the illustrious <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a>, 177-202.

<p>The discovery on the Hill of St. Sebastian of ruins of a <em>naumachia</em> capable of being transformed into an amphitheatre, and of some fragments of inscriptions apparently belonging to an altar of Augustus, has led several arch&aelig;ologists to believe that the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of Lyons suffered death on this hill. Very ancient tradition, however, represents the church of Ainay as erected at the place of their <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of St. Pothinus, under the choir of the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Nizier was destroyed in 1884. But there are still revered at Lyons the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> cell of St. Pothinus, where Anne of Austria, <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> came to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of St. Iren&aelig;us built at the end of the fifth century by St. Patiens, which contains the body of St. Iren&aelig;us. There are numerous funerary inscriptions of primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Lyons; the earliest dates from the year 334. In the second and third centuries the See of Lyons enjoyed great renown throughout Gaul, witness the local legends of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&#231;on</a> and of several other cities relative to the missionaries sent out by St. Iren&aelig;us. Faustinus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the second half of the third century, wrote to <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> and <a href="../cathen/14288a.htm">Pope Stephen I</a>, in 254, regarding the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> tendencies of Marcian, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles. But when <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> by the new provincial organization had taken away from Lyons its position as <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the three Gauls, the prestige of Lyons diminished for a time.

<p>At the end of the empire and during the Merovingian period several <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are counted among the Bishops of Lyons: <a href="../cathen/08586a.htm">St. Justus</a> (374-381) who died in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14561a.htm">Thebaid</a> and was renowned for the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in the struggle against <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> (the church of the Machabees, whither his body was brought, was as early as the fifty century a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> under the name of the collegiate church of <a href="../cathen/08586a.htm">St. Justus</a>), St. Alpinus and St. Martin (disciple of <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>; end of fourth century); St. Antiochus (400-410); St. Elpidius (410-422); St. Sicarius (422-33); <a href="../cathen/05595a.htm">St. Eucherius</a> (c. 433-50), a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of L&eacute;rins and the author of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, from whom doubtless dates the foundation at Lyons of the "hermitages" of which more will be said below; St. Patiens (456-98) who successfully combated the famine and <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, and whom Sidonius Apollinaris praised in a poem; St. Lupicinus (491-94); St. Rusticus (494-501); St. Stephanus (d. Before 515), who with <a href="../cathen/02161c.htm">St. Avitus</a> of Vienne, convoked a council at Lyons for the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>; St. Viventiolus (515-523), who in 517 presided with <a href="../cathen/02161c.htm">St. Avitus</a> at the Council of Epaone; St. Lupus, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (535-42), probably the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, who when signing in 438 the Council of Orl&eacute;ans added the title of "metropolitanus"; St. Sardot or Sacerdos (549-542), who presided in 549 at the Council of Orl&eacute;ans, and who obtained from King Childebert the foundation of the general <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>; <a href="../cathen/11053a.htm">St. Nicetius</a> or Nizier (552-73), who received from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the title of patriarch, and whose <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. The prestige of <a href="../cathen/11053a.htm">St. Nicetius</a> was lasting; his successor St. Priseus (573-588) bore the title of patriarch, and brought the council of 585 to decide that <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synods</a> should be convened every three years at the instance of the patriarch and of the king; St. &#198;therius (588-603), who was a correspondent of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> and who perhaps <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> St. Augustine, the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; St. Aredius (603-615); St. Annemundus or Chamond (c. 650), friend of <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a>, godfather of Clotaire III, <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by Ebroin together with his brother, and patron of the town of Saint-Chamond; St. Genesius or Genes (660-679 or 680), <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Fontenelle, grand almoner and minister of Queen Bathilde; St. Lambertus (c. 680-690), also <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Fontenelle.



<p>At the end of the fifth century Lyons was the capital of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, but after 534 it passed under the domination of the kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Ravaged by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> in 725, the city was restored through the liberality of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> who established a rich <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Ile Barbe. In the time of St. Patiens and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Constans (d. 488) the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Lyons was famous; Sidonius Apollinaris was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> there. The letter of Leidrade to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> (807) shows the care taken by the emperor for the restoration of learning in Lyons. With the aid of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Florus he made the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> so prosperous that in the tenth century Englishmen went thither to study. Under <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and his immediate successors, the Bishops of Lyons, whose ascendancy was attested by the number of councils over which they were called to preside, played an important <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> part. <a href="../cathen/01150a.htm">Adoptionism</a> had no more active enemies than Leidrade (798-814) and Agobard (814-840). When Felix of <a href="../cathen/15223b.htm">Urgel</a> continued rebellious to the condemnations pronounced against <a href="../cathen/01150a.htm">Adoptionism</a> from 791-799 by the Councils of Ciutad, Friuli, <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of sending to Urgel with Nebridius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Narbonne, and St. Benedict, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Aniane, Archbishop Leidrade, a native of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> and <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> librarian. They preached against <a href="../cathen/01150a.htm">Adoptionism</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, conducted Felix in 799 to the Council of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, where he seemed to submit to the arguments of <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin</a>, and then brought him back to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>., But the submission of Felix was not complete; Agobard, "Chorepiscopus" of Lyons, convicted him anew of <a href="../cathen/01150a.htm">Adoptionism</a> in a secret conference, and when Felix died in 815 there was found among his papers a treatise in which he professed <a href="../cathen/01150a.htm">Adoptionism</a>. Then Agobard, who had become <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Lyons in 814 after Leidrade's retirement to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. M&eacute;dard of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, composed a long treatise which completed the ruin of that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.

<p>Agobard displayed great activity as a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and a publicist in his opposition to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and to various <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a>. His rooted <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for all <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> led him in his treatise on images into certain expressions which savoured of <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasm</a>. The five historical treatises which he wrote in 833 to justify the deposition of Louis the Pious, who had been his benefactor, are a stain on his life. Louis the Pious having been restored to power, caused Agobard to be deposed in 835 by the Council of Thionville, but three years later gave him back his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, in which he died in 840. During the exile of Agobard the See of Lyons had been for a short time administered by <a href="../cathen/01376b.htm">Amalarius of Metz</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Florus charged with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> opinions regarding the "triforme corpus Christi", and who took part in the controversies with <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">Gottschalk</a> on the subject of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. Amolon (841-852) and St. Remy (852-75) continued the struggle against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a>, which condemned this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and also was engaged in strife with <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar</a>. From 879-1032 Lyons formed part of the Kingdom of Provence and afterwards of the second Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. When in 1302 Rudolph III, the Sluggard, ceded his states to Conrad the Salic, Emperor of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the portion of Lyons situated on the left bank of the Sa&ocirc;ne became, at least nominally, an imperial city. Finally Archbishop Burchard, brother of Rudolph, claimed <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of sovereignty over Lyons as inherited from his mother, Mathilde of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; in this way the government of Lyons instead of being exercised by the distant emperor, became a matter of dispute between the counts who claimed the inheritance and the successive <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>.

<p>Lyons attracted the attention of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Cardinal Hildebrand</a>, who held a council there in 1055 against the <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In 1076, as <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, he deposed Archbishop Humbert (1063-76) for <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>. Saint Gebuin (Jubinus), who succeeded Humbert was the confidant of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> and contributed to the reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the two councils of 1080 and 1082, at which were <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Manasses of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, Fulk of Anjou, and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Marmoutiers. It was under the episcopate of Saint Gebuin that <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> (20 April, 1079) established the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Lyons over the Provinces of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, and Sens, which primacy was specially confirmed by <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a>, despite the letter written to him in 1126 by Louis VI in favour of the church of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>. As far as it regarded the Province of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> this letter was later suppressed by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the king's council in 1702, at the request of <a href="../cathen/04096a.htm">Colbert</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>. Hugh (1081-1106), the successor of St. Gebuin, the friend of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, and for a while <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, had differences later on with <a href="../cathen/15410a.htm">Victor III</a>, who <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him for a time, also with Paschal II. The latter <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> came to Lyons in 1106, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the basilica of Ainay, and dedicated one of its altars in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Immaculate Conception. The Feast of the Immaculate Conception was solemnized at Lyons about 1128, perhaps at the instance of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm of Canterbury</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> wrote to the canons of Lyons to complain that they should have instituted a feast without consulting the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. As soon as Thomas &#224; Becket, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, had been proclaimed Blessed (1173), his cult was instituted at Lyons. Lyons of the twelfth century thus has a glorious place in the history of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> liturgy and even of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, but the twelfth century was also marked by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Peter Waldo and the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldenses</a>, the Poor Men of Lyons, who were opposed by Jean de Bell&#232;me (1181-1193), and by an important change in the political situation of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>.

<p>In 1157 <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a> confirmed the sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Lyons; thenceforth there was a lively contest between them and the counts. An arbitration effected by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1167 had no result, but by the treaty of 1173 Guy, Count of Forez, ceded to the canons of the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John his title of count of Lyons and his temporal authority. Then came the growth of the Commune, more belated in Lyons than in many other cities, but in 1193 the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> had to make some concession to the citizens. The thirteenth century was a period of conflict. Three times, in 1207, 1269, and 1290, grave troubles broke out between the partisans of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> who dwelt in the ch&#226;teau of Pierre Seize, those of the count-canons who lived in a separate quarter near the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and those of the townsfolk. <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> attempted, but without success, to restore peace by two Acts, 2 April, 1273, and 11 Nov., 1274. The kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> were always inclined to side with the commune; after the siege of Lyons by Louis X (1310) the treaty of 10 April, 1312, definitively attached Lyons to the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but, until the beginning of the fifteenth century the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Lyons was allowed to coin its own money.

<p>If the thirteenth century had imperilled the political sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, it had on the other hand made Lyons a kind of second <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> was a former canon of Lyons, while <a href="../cathen/08018a.htm">Innocent V</a>, as Peter of Tarantaise, was <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Lyons from 1272 to 1273. The <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the Hohenstaufen towards the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> forced <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> to seek refuge at Lyons and to hold there two <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a> (see <a href="../cathen/09476a.htm">L<font size=-2>YONS,</font> C<font size=-2>OUNCILS OF</font></a>). A free and independent city of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as well as of the Holy Empire, located in a central position between <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Lyons possessed in the thirteenth century important <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which naturally sheltered distinguished guests and their numerous followers. For several years <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> dwelt there with his court in the buildings of the chapter of <a href="../cathen/08586a.htm">Saint Justus</a>. Local tradition relates that it was on seeing the red hat of the canons of Lyons that the courtiers of <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of obtaining from the Council of Lyons its <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> should henceforth wear red hats. The sojourn of <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> at Lyons was marked by numerous works of public utility, to which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> gave vigorous encouragement. He granted <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> to the faithful who should assist in the construction of the bridge over the Rh&ocirc;ne, replacing that destroyed about 1190 by the passage of the troops of Richard C&aelig;ur de Lion on their way to the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a>. The building of the churches of St. John and <a href="../cathen/08586a.htm">St. Justus</a> was pushed forward with activity; he sent delegates even to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to solicit <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> for this purpose and he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> in both churches. At Lyons were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> (1305) and <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> (1310); at Lyons in 1449 the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/06031b.htm">Felix V</a> renounced the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a>; there, too, was held in 1512, without any definite conclusion, the last session of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a> against <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>. In 1560 the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> took Lyons by surprise, but they were driven out by Antoine* d'Albon, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Savigny and later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Lyons. Again masters of Lyons in 1562 they were driven thence by the Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal de Vieuville. At the command of the famous Baron des Adrets they committed numerous acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> in the region of Montbrison. It was at Lyons that Henry IV, the converted <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> king, married Marie de Medicis (9 December, 1600).

<p>The principal <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Lyons during the modern period were: Guy III d'Auvergne, Cardinal de Bologne (1340-1342), who as a diplomat rendered great service to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; Cardinal Jean de Lorraine (1537-1539); Hippolyte d'Este, Cardinal of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> (1539-1550), whom <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> named protector of the crown of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at the court of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, and a patron of scholars; Cardinal Fran&#231;ois de Tournon (1550-1562), who negotiated several times between <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> and <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, combated the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> and founded the Coll&#232;ge de Tournon, which the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> later made one of the most celebrated <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> of the kingdom; Antoine* d'Albon (1562-1574), editor of Rufinus and Ausonius; Pierre d'Epinac (1573-1599), active auxiliary of the League; Cardinal Alphonse Louis du Plessis de Richelieu (1628-1563), brother of the <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">minister of Louis XIII</a>; <a href="../cathen/14505a.htm">Cardinal de Tencin</a> (1740-1758); Antoine* de Montazet (1758-1788), a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> tendencies, whose <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> works will be referred to later, and who had published for his <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> by the Oratorian Joseph Valla, six volumes of "Institutiones theologic&aelig;" known as "Th&eacute;ologiede Lyon", and spread throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> by Scipio Ricci until condemned by the Index in 1792; Marbeuf (1788-1799), who died in exile at L&uuml;beck in 1799 and whose <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> Castillon was beheaded at Lyons in 1794; Antoine* Adrien Lamourette (1742-1794), deputy to the Constitutional Assembly, who brought about by a curious speech (7 July, 1792) an understanding between all parties, to which was given the jesting name of "Baiser Lamourette", and who was constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lyons from 27 March, 1791, to 11 January, 1794, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death on the scaffold. Among the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> subsequent to the Concordat must be mentioned: <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Joseph Fesch</a> under whose episcopate <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> twice visited Lyons, in Nov., 1804, and April, 1805, and in 1822 the Society for the Propagation of the Faith was founded; Maurice de Bonald (1840-1870), son of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>; <a href="../cathen/06562a.htm">Ginoulhiac</a> (1870-1875), known by his "Histoire du dogme catholique pendant let trois premiers si&#232;cles".
<h2>Chapters and colleges</h2>

<p>At the end of the old regime the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> chapter consisted of 32 canons, each able to prove 32 degrees of military nobility; each of these canons bore the title of Count of Lyons. The Chapter of Lyons has the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of numbering among its canons four <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> (<a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a>, <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>), 20 <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, 20 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, more than 80 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and finally 3 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of officially recognized <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>: St. Ismidon of Sassenage, later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Die (d. About 1116), Blessed <a href="../cathen/09376a.htm">Blessed Louis Aleman</a> and Blessed Fran&#231;ois d'Estaing, later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13107a.htm">Rodez</a> (d. In 1501). The city of Lyons numbered 5 collegiate churches and the diocese 14 others. There were 4 chapters of noble canonesses. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had at Lyons the Coll&#232;ge de la Trinit&eacute;, founded in 1527 by a lay confraternity which ceded it to them in 1565, the Coll&#232;ge Notre Dame, founded in 1630, a house of probation, a professed house, and other colleges in the diocese. Convents were perhaps more numerous here than in any other part of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The Petites Ecoles founded in 1670 by D&eacute;mia, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Bourg, contributed much to primary instruction at Lyons. Since the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1875 concerning higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> Lyons possesses <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> faculties of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, letters, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, and law.
<h2>Principal saints</h2>

<p>The Diocese of Lyons honours as <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: St. Epipodius and his companion St. Alexander, probably <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> under <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> St. Peregrinus (third century); St. Baldonor (Galmier), a native of Aveizieux, at first a locksmith, whose <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> was remarked by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, St. Viventiolus; he became a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> at the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/08586a.htm">St. Justus</a>, then <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, and died about 760; the thermal resort of "Aqu&aelig; Segest&aelig;", in whose church Viventiolus met him, has taken the name of St. Galmier; St. Viator (d. About 390), who followed the Bishop, <a href="../cathen/08586a.htm">St. Justus</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/14561a.htm">Thebaid</a>; Sts. Romanus and Lupicinus (fifth century), natives of the Diocese of Lyons who lived as solitaries within the present territory of the Diocese of St. Claude; St. Consortia, d. about 578, who according to a legend, criticized by <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a>, was a daughter of <a href="../cathen/05595a.htm">St. Eucherius</a>; St. Rambert, soldier and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> in the seventh century, patron of the town of the same name; Blessed Jean Pierre N&eacute;el, b. in 1832 at Ste. Catherine sur Riviere, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at Kay-Tcheou in 1862.

<p>Among the natives of Lyons must be mentioned Sidonius Apollinaris (430-489); Abb&eacute; Morellet, litterateur (1727-1819); the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Ballanche (1776-1847); the religious <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> <a href="../cathen/06096a.htm">Hippolyte Flandrin</a> (1809-1864); <a href="../cathen/12584d.htm">Puvis de Chavannes</a>, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of the life of Ste Genevi&#232;ve (1824-1898). The diocese of Lyons is also the birthplace of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> P&#232;re Coton (1564-1626), confessor of Henry IV and a native of N&eacute;ronde, and Abb&eacute; Terray, controller general of finance under Louis XVI, a native of Boen (1715-1778). <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a>, whose old age was spent at Lyons in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, where he instructed poor children, died there in 1429. <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a> died at Lyons, 28 December, 1622. The Cur&eacute; Colombet de St. Amour was celebrated at St. Etienne in the seventeenth century for the generosity with which he founded the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu (the charity <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>), also free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and fed the workmen during the famine of 1693.

<p>M. Guigue has catalogued the eleven "hermitages" (eight of them for men and three for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>) which were distinctive of the ascetical life of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Lyons in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; these were cells in which <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> shut themselves up for life after four years of trial. The system of hermitages along the lines described by Grimalaius and Olbredus in the ninth century flourished especially from the eleventh to the thirteenth century, and disappeared completely in the sixteenth. These hermitages were the private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of a neighbouring church or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which installed therein for life a male or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a>. The general almshouse of Lyons, or charity <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, was founded in 1532 after the great famine of 1531 under the supervision of eight administrators chosen from among the more important citizens. The institution of the jubilee of St. Nizier dates beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> to the stay of <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> at Lyons. This jubilee, which had all the privileges of the secular jubilees of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was celebrated each time that Low Thursday, the feast of St. Nizier, coincided with 2 April, i.e. whenever the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">feast of Easter</a> itself was on the earliest day allowed by the paschal cycle, namely 22 March. In 1818, the last time this coincidence occurred, the feast of St. Nizier was not celebrated. But the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. John also enjoys a great jubilee each time that the feast of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a> coincides with <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>, that is, whenever the feast of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> falls on 24 June. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that in 1451 the coincidence of these two feasts was celebrated with special splendour by the population of Lyons, then emerging from the troubles of the Hundred Years' War, but there is no document to prove that the jubilee <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> existed at that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. However, Lyonnese tradition places the first great jubilee in 1451; the four subsequent jubilees took place in 1546, 1666, 1734 and 1886.
<h2>Liturgy</h2>

<p>Some authors have held that the Gallican Liturgy was merely the Liturgy of Ephesus, brought to Gaul by the founders of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Lyons. Mgr Duchesne considers that during the two centuries after <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> the prestige of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Lyons was not such that it could dictate a liturgy across the Pyrenees, the Channel and the Alps, and lure from Roman influence half the Churches of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In his opinion it was not Lyons, but <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, which was the centre of the diffusion of the Gallican Liturgy. Under Leidrade and Agobard the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Lyons, although fulfilling the task of purifying its <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> texts exacted by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, upheld its own traditions. "Among the Churches of France", wrote St. Bernard to the canons of Lyons, "that of Lyons has hitherto had ascendancy over all the others, as much for the dignity of its see as for its praiseworthy institutions. It is especially in the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> that this judicious Church has never readily acquiesced in unexpected and sudden novelties, and has never submitted to be tarnished by innovations which are becoming only to youth". In the seventeenth century <a href="../cathen/02645b.htm">Cardinal Bona</a>, in his treatise "De divina psalmodia", renders similar homage to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Lyons. But in the eighteenth century Bishop Montazet, contrary to the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> on the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, changed the text of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, from which there resulted a whole century of troubles for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Lyons. The efforts of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> and Cardinal Bonald to suppress the innovations of Montazet provoked great resistance on the part of the canons, who feared an attempt against the traditional Lyonnese ceremonies. This culminated in 1861 in a protest on the part of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, as much with regard to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> as to the Vatican. Finally, on 4 Feb., 1864, at a reception of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Lyons, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> declared his displeasure at this agitation and assured them that nothing should be changed in the ancient Lyonnese ceremonies; by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 17 March, 1864, he ordered the progressive introduction of the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> and <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> in the diocese. The <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> church of Lyons adopted them for public services 8 December, 1869. One of the most touching rites of the ancient Gallican liturgy, retained by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Lyons, is the blessing of the people by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at the moment of Communion.
<h2>Churches</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. John, begun in the twelfth century on the ruins of a sixth century church, was completed in 1476; worthy of note are the two crosses to right and left of the altar, preserved since the council of 1274 as a symbol of the union of the churches, and the Bourbon <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, built by Cardinal de Bourbon and his brother Pierre de Bourbon, son-in-law of Louis XI, a masterpiece of fifteenth century <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>. The church of Ainay, dating from the tenth and eleventh centuries, is of the Byzantine style. The doorway of St. Nizier's (fifteenth century) was carved in the sixteenth century by Philibert Delorme. The collegiate <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John Baptist at St. Chamond, now destroyed, presented a singular arrangement; the <a href="../cathen/02394d.htm">belfry</a> was situated below the church, to which those coming from the city could only gain access by climbing two hundred steps; the roof of the church served as pavement for the courtyard of the fortress, the circuit of which might be made in a carriage.
<h2>Pilgrimages</h2>

<p>The chief <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are Notre Dame de Fourvi&#232;res, a sanctuary <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the time of St. Pothinus, on the site of a <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Venus. In 1643 the people of Lyons <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> themselves to Notre Dame de Fourvi&#232;res and pledged themselves to a solemn procession on 8 September of each year; the new basilica of Fourvi&#232;res, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1896, attracts numerous <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. Notre Dame de Benoite-Vaux at Saint-Etienne, a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> founded in 1849 by the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a> who had been <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> preserved from a flood; Notre-Dame de Valfleury, near Saint Chamond, a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the eighth century and re-established in 1629 after a plague; Notre Dame de Vernay, near Roanne.
<h2>Religious congregations</h2>
