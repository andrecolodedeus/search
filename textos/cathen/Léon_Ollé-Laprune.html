<h1>L&eacute;on Oll&eacute;-Laprune</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, b. in 1839; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 19 Feb., 1898. Under the influence of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Caro and of <a href="../cathen/06731b.htm">P&egrave;re Gratry's</a> book "Les Sources", Oll&eacute;-Laprune, after exceptionally brilliant studies at the Ecole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure (1858 to 1861), devoted himself to philosophy. His life was spent in teaching a philosophy illuminated by the light of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, first in the <em>lyc&eacute;es</em> and then in the Ecole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure from 1875. As <a href="../cathen/11378a.htm">Ozanam</a> had been a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> professor of history and foreign literature in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, Oll&eacute;-Laprune's aim was to be a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> there. P&egrave;re de R&egrave;gnon, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, wrote to him: "I am glad to think that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills in our time to revive the lay apostolate, as in the times of <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> and <a href="../cathen/02042b.htm">Athenagoras</a>; it is you especially who give me these thoughts." The Government of the Third Republic was now and then urged by a certain section of the press to punish the "clericalism" of Oll&eacute;-Laprune, but the repute of his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> teaching protected him. For one year only (1881-82), after organizing a manifestation in favour of the expelled congregations, he was suspended from his chair by Jules Ferry, and the first to sign the protest addressed by his students to the minister on behalf of their professor was the future socialist deputy Jean Jaur&egrave;s, then a student at the Ecole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure.

<p>Oll&eacute;-Laprune's first important work was "La Philosophiede Malebranche" (1870). Ten years later to obtain the doctorate he defended before the Sorbonne a thesis on moral certitude. As against the exaggerations of <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesian</a> <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> and Positivistic determinism he investigated the part of the will and the heart in the phenomenon of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. This work resembles in many respects <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> "Grammar of Assent"; but Oll&eacute;-Laprune must not, any more than the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, be held responsible for subsequent tendencies which have sought to diminish the share of the intelligence in the act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and to separate completely the domain of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> from that of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. In his "Essai sur la morale d'Aristote" (1881) Oll&eacute;-Laprune defended the "Eudaemonism" of the Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> against the <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantian</a> theories; and in "La philosophie et le temps pr&eacute;sent" (1890) he vindicated, against Deistic spiritualism, the right of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> thinker to go beyond the data of "natural religion" and illuminate philosophy by the data of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a>. One of his most influential works was the "Prix de la vie" (1894), wherein he shows why life is worth living. The advice given by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> found in Oll&eacute;-Laprune to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> found in Oll&eacute;-Laprune an active champion. His brochure "Ce qu'on va chercher &agrave; Rome" (1895) was one of the best commentaries on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> policy. The Academy of Moral and Political Sciences elected him a member of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> section in 1897 to succeed Vacherot. His articles and conferences attest his growing influence in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> circles. He became a leader of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> activity, consulted and heard by all until his premature death when he was about to finish a book on Jouffroy (Paris, 1899). Many of his articles have been collected by Goyau under the title "La Vitalit&eacute; chr&eacute;tienne" (1901). Here will also be found a series of his unedited meditations, which by a noteworthy coincidence bore the future motto of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, "Omnia instaurare in Christo". Professor Delbos of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> published in 1907 the course which Oll&eacute;-Laprune had given on reason and <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> (La raison et le rationalisme). Some months after his death Mr. William P. Coyne called him with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> "the greatest <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> who has appeared in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> since <a href="../cathen/11378a.htm">Ozanam</a>" ("New Ireland Review", June, 1899, p. 195).
