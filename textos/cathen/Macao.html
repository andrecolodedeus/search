<h1>Macao</h1>  

<p>(MACAOENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a>; suffragan of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, founded 23 January, 1575, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Super Specula Militantis Ecclesiae", of <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>, with its see in the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> settlement of Macao (or Macau), on the island of Heung-Shan, adjacent to the coast of the Chinese Province of Kwang-tung (see <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">CHINA</a>, <em>Map</em>). The name by which this settlement has long been currently known is supposed to be of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> origin, compounded of <em>Ma</em>, the name of a local divinity, and <em>gau</em>, "harbour"; for this native name the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> vainly attempted to substitute the more <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but more unwieldly, form, "A Cidade do Santo Nome de Deus de Macau". The commercial prosperity of Macao, once very considerable, has been almost extinguished in modern times by the rival British settlement of Hong Kong, planted, about 40 miles to the east, in the year 1842. The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> of Macao, taken from the earlier <a href="../cathen/09562a.htm">Diocese of Malacca</a>, at first included the whole of the Chinese and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> Empires. This vast territory was reduced by the creation (1588) of the Diocese of Funay for <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, and in 1676, after the Dioceses of Peking and Nanking and the Vicariate Apostolic of Tonking had been created, the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Macao did not extend beyond the Chinese Provinces of Kwang-Si and Kwang-Tung. This territory has since been still more curtailed, while the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> has been extended in Malaysia and Further <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. The present effective <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Macao comprises (1) the city of Macao and some small islands adjacent to it; (2) the District of Heung-Shan and part of that of San Ui; (3) the Prefecture of Shiu-Heng (twelve districts); (4) part of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> populations of <a href="../cathen/09562a.htm">Malacca</a> and Singapore; (5) all the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> part of the island of Timor.

<p>At the end of sixteenth century <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was making rapid progress at Macao, which city had become an important centre of missionary activity in the Far East. Here the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the pioneers in this field, established the two great colleges of St. Paul and St. Joseph; the former &#151; famous in missionary annals as "a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>" &#151; was the principal college of the Province of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>; the latter, of the Vice-Province of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, and the Augustinians soon had <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> at Macao, the last-named founding the hermitage of Nossa Senhora da Penha (Our Lady of the Peak). Other churches <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from this golden age of religion in Macao are the Cathedral, the Santa Casa de Misericordia, the hermitage of Nossa Senhora de Guia, the sanctuary of St. James at the mouth of the harbour, and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches of St. Anthony and <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>. A severe blow was dealt to missionary enterprise in these regions by the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> (1762), in spite of which, however, and in the face of bitter persecutions, the Chinese missions, of which Macao had been the original point of departure, still numbered some 100,000 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> at the end of the eighteenth century. Since that period the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> Government while continuing its <em>padroado</em>, or patronage of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> possessions of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, has at various times adopted a policy hostile to the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders in general, which have been, in consequence, expelled from Macao, as from other Portuguese territory (see MARQUES DE SEBASTI&Atilde;O JOS&Eacute; DE CARVALHO POMBAL; <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">PORTUGAL</a>).

<p>Of the twenty-one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of this see, perhaps the most distinguished was the first, <a href="../cathen/03370a.htm">Melchior M. Carneiro</a>, who was also one of the earliest fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. He had been confessor to <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius Loyola</a>, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/05670a.htm">Evora</a>, and, after holding several other important posts in his order, was made <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nic&aelig;a, coadjutor to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, and (1566) administrator of the missions of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. He occupied the See of Macao from its foundation, in 1575, to 1583, during which period he established the Santa Casa de Misericordia, the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of St. Raphael, and the leper-house of St. Lazarus. Among his successors, Dom Jo&atilde;o de Casal (1690-1735), who lived ninety years and occupied the See of Macao for half his lifetime, assisted in the events which led up to the visit of Tour non, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, and his death at Macao (see <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">BENEDICT XIV</a>; CHINA, <em>The Question of Rites</em>; MATTHEW REX). Bishop Francisco Chasm (1805-28), a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, founded at Macao several important <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, reformed the capitular <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and made a collection of its valuable documents. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was rebuilt and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Bishop Jeronymo de Matta (1845-59), who also founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of girls and committed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> to the care of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Manuel B. de S. Ennes, Fellow of the <a href="../cathen/04095c.htm">University of Coimbra</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Macao from 1874 to 1883, was noted in his time for the doctoral thesis in which he refuted the sceptical <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a> of Friedrich Strauss; it was his task to execute the Letter Apostolic, "Universis Orbis Ecclesiis", giving new boundaries to the diocese. This <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> did much for the missions in the island of Timor, as did also his successor. Jos&eacute; M. de Carvalho (1897-1902), who divided that mission into two vicariates, one of which was entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. The present (twenty-first) <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Macao, Dom J.P. d'Azevedo e Castro, formerly vice-rector of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/01513c.htm">Angra</a>, was installed in 1902. During his incumbency of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, the change of territory between his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and the Prefecture Apostolic of Kwang-Tung, ordered by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, has been accomplished in spite of serious difficulties; the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Missionary Sisters of St. Mary have been placed in charge of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/13192c.htm">St. Rose of Lima</a>, the Collegio de Perseveran&ccedil;a has been founded for homeless <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, under the Canossian Sisters (who have also opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls at <a href="../cathen/09562a.htm">Malacca</a>), and an industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for Chinese boys has been opened by the fathers of the <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesian Society</a>. With an aggregate population of about 8,000,000, of whom only about 50,000 are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, the spiritual activities of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> necessarily take the form, to a great extent, of preaching to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. In the city of Macao, which is divided into three <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, under the direction of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit fathers</a>, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educates</a> some 120 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, Portuguese and natives. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesian Society</a> are the only religious institutes for men now (1910) established in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; religious institutes for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are represented by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> and Canossian Sisters, the total number of sisters being about 100. There are at present 70 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, including, besides <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a>, a certain number of Eurasians, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a>, and even natives of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. In Macao itself the race most largely represented is still the Chinese; in <a href="../cathen/09562a.htm">Malacca</a> and Singapore, also, many Chinese are still to be found side by side with the native Malays and the other races, including <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a>, collected in those great commercial centres. The missionaries in Timor have to deal, mainly, with two races, the Malay and the Papuan. The full-blooded Malay is usually a <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a>, and is rarely <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; the Papuan is far more tractable in this direction. A serious difficulty for the missionaries is the vast number of languages and dialects spoken in Timor. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> being the state religion of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> and the five government <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> at Macao and in Portuguese Timor are all open to the ministrations of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and sisters; three of these <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> have <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> of their own. The government also maintains on the islands of Coloane and Dom Jo&atilde;o, near Macao, two leper-houses, which are frequently visited by missionaries and sisters. Besides the "League of Suffrages", to aid the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of those who have departed this life in the service of the missions, numerous pious associations flourish in the diocese &#151; the Sodality of Our Lady, for students; the Sodality of Our Lady of Sorrows, for married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; the Confraternities of the <a href="../cathen/13188b.htm">Holy Rosary</a>, Nossa Senhora dos Remedios, the Immaculate Conception, St. Anthony, and O Senhor dos Passos; the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis. The <a href="../cathen/01633a.htm">Apostleship of Prayer</a> has been canonically erected and is busily engaged at Macao and in many of the missions. Lastly, the pious association of the Bread of St. Anthony is devoted to relieving the sufferings of the poor.
