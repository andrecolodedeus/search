<h1>Macarius of Antioch</h1>  

<p>A Patriarch, deposed in 681. Macarius's dignity seems to have been a purely honorary one, for his <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> lay under the dominion of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, and he himself resided at Constantinople. Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of him before the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Sixth General Council</a> which deposed him on account of his <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a>, and after the council he disappeared in a Roman <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. But he has left his mark on <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> by bringing about the condemnation of Honorius. In the first session of the council the Roman <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> delivered an address, in the course of which they spoke of four successive <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of Constantinople and others as having "disturbed the peace of the world by new and unorthodox expressions". Macarius retorted, "We did not publish new expressions but what we have received from the holy and &oelig;cumenical <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> and from holy approved fathers". He then went through the names given by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, adding to them that of Pope Honorius. In this and the following session Macarius came to grief over a passage from <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> and <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a>, in which, after the manner of a man who sees everything through coloured glasses, he tried to find <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a>. In the third session some documents which he produced as emanating from <a href="../cathen/10190a.htm">Mennas</a> and <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a> were found to be forgeries, surreptitiously introduced into the Acts of the fifth general council. In the fifth and sixth sessions he and his adherents produced three volumes of patristic testimonies which were sealed up for examination later on. In the eighth session he read his <em>ecthesis</em>, or "profession of faith", in which the authority of Honorius was appealed to on behalf of <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a>. In answer to questions put to him by the emperor he declared that he would rather be cut to pieces and thrown into the sea than admit the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of two wills or operations. In this same session and the following one his patristic testimonies were found to be hopelessly garbled. He was formally deposed at the close of the ninth session.

<p>But Macarius had left the council more work to do. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> seemed determined that <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a> should be disposed of once and for all, so, when at the eleventh session the emperor inquired if there was any further business, they answered that there were some further writings presented by Macarius and one of his disciples still awaiting examination. Among these documents was the first letter of Honorius to Sergius. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, apparently without any reluctance, accepted the necessity of condemning Honorius. They must have felt that any other course of action would leave the door open for a revival of <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a>. Their conduct in this respect is the more noteworthy because the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Sixth General Council</a> acted throughout on the assumption that (it is no anachronism to use the language of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>) the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> definitions of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> were <em>irreformable</em>. The council had not met to deliberate but to bring about submission to the epistle of Pope St. Agatho &mdash; an uncompromising assertion of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> &mdash; addressed to it (see Harnack, "Dogmengesch.", II, 408; 2nd edition). At the close of the council Macarius and five others were sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to be dealt with by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. This was done at the request of the council and not, as Hefele makes it appear, at the request of Macarius and his adherents (History of Councils, V, 179; Eng. trans.). Macarius and three others who still held out were confined in different <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> (see <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">Liber Pontificalis</a>, Leo II). Later on <a href="../cathen/02427d.htm">Benedict II</a> tried for thirty days to persuade Macarius to recant. This attempt was quoted in the first session of the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Seventh General Council</a> as a precedent for the restoration of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had fallen from the Faith. <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> gives reasons for supposing that Benedict's purpose was to restore Macarius to his patriarchal dignity, the patriarch who had succeeded him having just died (Annales, ann. 685). Before taking leave of Macarius we may call attention to the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Eucharist, in his "Ecthesis", which is, perhaps, the earliest instance of a reference to this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in a formal creed. To Macarius the Eucharist was a palmary argument against <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>. The flesh and blood of which we partake in the Eucharist is not mere flesh and blood, else how would it be life-giving? It is life-giving because it is the own flesh and blood of the Word, which being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is by nature Life. Macarius develops this argument in a manner which shows how shadowy was the line which separated the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite</a> from the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>. (See HONORIUS I; COUNCILS OF CONSTANTINOPLE, A. III.)
