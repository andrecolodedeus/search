<h1>Madras</h1>  

<p>(MADRASPATAM; MADRASPATANA)

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. Its area is about 40,350 square miles, and the population about 50,000 out of a total of over seven millions. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is under the care of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> (<a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> and native) and the missionaries of St. Joseph, Mill Hill. There are in the archdiocese 47 churches and 135 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> in charge of 59 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (of whom 39 are <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a>,18 natives and 2 Eurasians), assisted by the Brothers of St. Patrick and of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, Nuns of the Orders of the Presentation and the Good Shepherd, the Sisters of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, and the Native Sisterhoods of St. Anne, of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, of St. Fancis Xavier, numbering in all 262.

<p>From the year 1606 the districts covered by the present Diocese of Madras belonged to the Padroado See of San Thom&eacute;. In 1642, however, a <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> mission was started at Madras and erected into a <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefecture Apostolic</a> under <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. This mission was kept up by the same order until the substitution of a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> in 1832. The frequent vacancies of the See of San Thom&eacute; and other reasons led the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in 1832 to erect a new <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> in place of the old <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefecture Apostolic</a>, and, by the brief "Multa Praclare" of 1838, to withdraw entirely the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of San Thom&eacute; as well as the other Padroado suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>, transferring this portion of it to the new <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Madras, the other portions being assigned to the Vicars Apostolic of Madura, of Bengal, and of the Coromandel Coast (Pondicherry), etc. The Vicariate of Madras was at first very extensive, but was reduced by the erection of new vicariates &mdash; those of <a href="../cathen/15496a.htm">Vizagapatam</a> in 1849 and Hyderabad in 1851. On the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in 1886, Madras was made into an archdiocese, with Vizagapatam and Hyderabad as suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and the following year a third suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was added at <a href="../cathen/10669a.htm">Nagpur</a> by a subdivision of the territory of Vizagapatnam. Subsequently the Doab of Raichur was ceded to Hyderabad, and thus the present boundaries were arrived at. Within the confines of the archdiocese there are five exempted churches in Madras belonging to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of San Thom&eacute;, and on the other hand Adyar in the Mylapore confines is under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Madras.
