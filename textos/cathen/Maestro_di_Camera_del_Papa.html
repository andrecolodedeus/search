<h1>Maestro di Camera del Papa</h1>  

<p>In former times there were four so-called palace <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> (<em>prelati palatini</em>): <ul><li>the Major Domo; <li>the Maestro di Camera; <li>the Auditor to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; and <li>the <a href="../cathen/10039a.htm">Master of the Sacred Palace</a>.</ul> As the position of auditor had been allowed to remain vacant during the later years of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII's</a> pontificate, it was abolished as being superfluous at the beginning of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X's</a> reign. And when the major domo, Mgr. Cagiano de Azevedo, was raised to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> on 11 Nov., 1905, the then maestro di camera, Mgr. Gaetano Bisleti, was promoted to the office of major domo; in the "Gerarchia Cattolica" for 1906 the office of maestro di camera is vacant, and a footnote says: "The <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of maestro di camera are temporarily transferred to His Excellency the Monsignor Major Domo". This state of affairs still continues, so that there are now only three palace prelacies and (as one official discharges the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> attached to two of these) only two palatine <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. All three <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> have the right of residence in the Apostolic palace.

<p>The maestro di camera is the real chief chamberlain. His authority extends over all matters concerning the daily personal service of His Holiness. He is the immediate superior of all the chamberlains, both <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> and lay; he has charge of the service of the Anticamera as regards the four acting <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> privy chamberlains; he informs the orderly officer of the Noble, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a>, and Palace Guards respectively, of the hours of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> for the next day; he summons the privy and honorary lay chamberlains to their period of weekly service, and dismisses them at the end of it. All petitions for audiences are lodged with him, whether they are presented to him immediately or whether they are presented to him (in diplomatic language) <em>mediately</em>, by the Secretary of State. He issues the summonses to audiences, and regulates all occasional, unusual, or unofficial ceremonies, such as the reception of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> and the like. Being in daily personal touch with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he receives his orders concerning the Anticamera of the next day, and makes arrangements accordingly. As supernumerary Prothonotary Apostolic he is always at the head of this college of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, irrespective of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his appointment. At <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> audiences and on other occasions when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sits upon his throne without pontifical vestments, the major domo stands on the right, the maestro di camera on the left, both on the second step of the throne. The extent of this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate's</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is limited exclusively to the reception rooms of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He also has some ancient privileges, which may be read of in Humphrey, "Urbs et Orbis".
