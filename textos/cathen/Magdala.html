<h1>Magdala</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>Migdal</em> = tower, fortress; Aramaic <em>Magdala</em>; Greek <em>Magdala</em>).

<p>It is perhaps the <em>Migdal-El</em> mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> (<a href="../bible/jos019.htm#vrs38">Joshua 19:38</a>) belonging to the tribe of <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">Nephtali</a>. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> in his version of <a href="../cathen/05616a.htm">Eusebius's "Chronicle"</a> supposes the place to be in the neighbourhood of Dor (Tanturah) on the sea-coast; Kiepert, on the contrary, identifies it with &lsquo;Athlit (<em>Castellum Peregrinorum</em>). The territory of <a href="../cathen/10749a.htm">Nephtali</a>, however, never extended so far to the west. According to <a href="../bible/mat015.htm#vrs39">Matthew 15:39</a>, after the second multiplication of loaves, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> went with His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> into the country of Magedan, the name given in various forms (by many of the best authorities, <em>Aleph</em>, B, D, Old Lat., Old Syr., Vulg.). Very many earlier authorities, however, give Magdala instead of Magedan (15 Greek uncials, the Minusculi, 1 Old Lat., Armen., Boh., &#198;th., Syr., Hex.). The parallel passage in Mark., viii, 10, reads in most recensions Dalmanutha (only D, Syr. Sin. Old Lat. with one exception, Goth., and some Minusculi agree with the name in Matthew). A solution is rendered difficult by the fact that the situation is unknown, and the direction cannot be inferred from the Gospel. The most plausible suggestion is that of van Kasteren who thinks Dalmanutha is the modern El-Delhamiye, about four miles south of the southern end of the lake near the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, north of the influx of the Yarmuk. He also thinks that Magedan is represented by Ma&lsquo;ad, still more to the south (the change of <em>ghimel</em> to <em>ayin</em> offers no difficulty). In sound the transition from Magdala to Magadan is not impossible in paleography; it is indeed easily intelligible.

<p>The existence of a Galilean Magdala, the birthplace or home of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">St. Mary <em>Magdalen</em></a> (i.e. of Magdala), is indicated by <a href="../bible/luk008.htm">Luke 8:2</a>; <a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs9">Mark 16:9</a>; <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#vrs56">Matthew 27:56, 61</a>; <a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs1">28:1</a>, and in the parallel passages, <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs1">John 20:1, 18</a>. The Talmud distinguishes between two Magdalas only. One was in the east, on the Yarmuk near Gadara (in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> Jadar, now Mukes), thus acquiring the name of <em>Magdala Gadar</em>; as a much frequented watering place it was called <em>Magdala &#199;eba &lsquo;ayya</em> (now El-Hammi, about two hours' journey from the southern end of the lake to the east, near a railway station, Haifa-Dera&lsquo;a). According to various passages in the Talmud, there was another Magdala near <a href="../cathen/14716a.htm">Tiberias</a>, at a distance from it of about three and three-quarters miles. Only one mile being given in the Palestinian Talmud, several different places have been identified with it; wrongly, however, for according to the parallel passages in the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Talmud and the context of the passage, the reading must be condemned as an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. This Magdala, perhaps to distinguish it from the place similarly named east of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, is called <em>Magdala Nunayya</em>, "Magdala of the Fishes", by which its situation near the lake and plentiful fisheries appear to be indicated. According to the Talmud, Magdala was a wealthy town, and was destroyed by the Romans because of the moral depravity of its inhabitants. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> gives an account (Bell. jud., III, x) of the taking of a town in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, which was situated on the lake near <a href="../cathen/14716a.htm">Tiberias</a> and which had received its Greek name, Tariche&aelig; (the Hebrew name is not given), from its prosperous fisheries. Pliny places the town to the south of the lake, and it has been searched for there. But a due regard for the various references in <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, who was often in the town and was present at its capture, leaves no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that Tariche&aelig; lay to the north of <a href="../cathen/14716a.htm">Tiberias</a> and thirty stadia from it (about three and three-quarters miles). The identity of Tariche&aelig; with Magdala Nunayya is thus as good as established.

<p>After the destruction of the Temple, Magdala Nunayya became the seat of one of the twenty-four <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> divisions, and several <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> sprang from the town. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> tradition sought there the home of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a>. If we are to believe the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> patriarch, Euthychius of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, the brother of St Basil, <a href="../cathen/11773c.htm">Peter of Sebaste</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of a church at Magdala in the second half of the fourth century, which was dedicated to the memory of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a>. About the middle of the sixth century, the pilgrim Theodosius reckoned Magdala's distance from <a href="../cathen/14716a.htm">Tiberias</a> in the south and Heptapegon (now &lsquo;Ain Tabgha) in the north at two miles. At all events the reckonings as to the relative distance between the two places is approximately right. At the end of the eighth century St. Willibald went as a pilgrim from <a href="../cathen/14716a.htm">Tiberias</a> past Magdala to Capharnaum. In the tenth century the church and house of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a> were shown. The Russian <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> Daniel (1106) and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Quaresimus (1616) give the place the name of Magdalia. The small poverty-stricken village, El-Mejdel, has kept the name and situation to this day. It lies about midway between Tabaryya and &lsquo;Ain Tabgha, at the south end of the little fruitful plain of Genesareth, and rests on the declivities of the mountain which projects over the lake. Towards the west the connection with the inner country of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> is effected through Wadi Hamam, past Qarn Hattin. In the caverns of Wadi Haman, about half an hour to the west of Magdala, the Galilean robber bands during the time of the first <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> used to find a safe refuge. Later the caves were occupied by <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a>, until finally a stronghold was established there by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>. Mejdel, with its few dirty huts and single palm tree, is all that is left of luxurious Magdala. No ruins of any importance have yet been uncovered.
