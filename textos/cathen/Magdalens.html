<h1>Magdalens</h1>  

<p>The members of certain <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of penitent <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who desired to reform their lives. As time went on, however, others of blameless reputation were also admitted, until many communities were composed entirely of the latter, who still retained the name of Magdalens, or White ladies from the colour of their garb. It is not known at what period the first house was established, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of foundation of the Metz <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, usually given as 1005, being still in dispute. Rudolph of Worms is the traditional founder of the Magdalens in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (Mon. Germ. Script., XVII, 234), where they were in existence early in the thirteenth century, as attested by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> and <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> (1243-54), granting them important privileges. <a href="../cathen/07214a.htm">H&eacute;lyot</a> quotes letters addressed by Otto, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of the Title of St. Nicholas in Carcere Tulliano, Apostolic Legate in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, granting <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> to those contributing to the support of the German Magdalens. Among the earliest foundations in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> were those at Naumburg-on-the Queis (1217), and Speyer (1226). <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, in a letter to Rudolph, prescribed for the penitents the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>, which was adopted by most of the Magdalens, though many of the German houses later affiliated themselves to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> or <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Orders. Institutions of Magdalens still exist, e.g. at Lauban (founded 1320) and Studenz, for the care of the sick and old. Few of the German <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> survived the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>.

<p>Houses of the Magdalens were soon founded in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. The first foundation in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was made at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> about 1272 by Bertrand, a saintly man who associated with himself in his work of rescuing fallen <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> other <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> men, later constituted a religious congregation by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a>, under the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>. In 1492 the eloquence of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> P&egrave;re Jean Tisserand influenced a number of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to turn from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ways and embrace a life of penitence. Five years later Jean-Simon, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, prescribed for them the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a> and drew up special <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> for their direction. From the beginning of the seventeenth century these Magdalens of Rue St-Denis were all <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of stainless lives. Among other prominent communities of Magdalens were those at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> (1324), <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1592), <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> established one in 1520, Seville (1550), <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>.

<p><em>The Madelonnettes</em>, members of another Order of St. Mary Magdalen, were founded in 1618 by the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> P&egrave;re Athanase Mol&eacute;, who, assisted by <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, gathered a number of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who desired to reform their lives. Two years later some of these were admitted to religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> by <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>, and were placed successively under Religious of the Visitation, <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, and Sisters <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> of the Mercy of Jesus, and from 1720 under Religious of Our Lady of Charity. The constitutions, drawn up in 1637, were approved by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1640, and the house was erected by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> into a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Two branch foundations were made at <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> and <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>. The order comprised three congregations, (1) the Magdalens proper, who had been deemed worthy of being admitted to solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, (2) the Sisters of Saint Martha, who, for some reason, could not undertake the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and were bound by simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> only, and (3) the Sisters of St. Lazarus, <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">public sinners</a> confined against their will. Each congregation had a separate building and observed a different rule of life. Sisters of St. Martha were admitted to the ranks of the Magdalens after two years <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. This order is no longer in existence.
