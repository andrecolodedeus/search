<h1>Magi</h1>  

<p>(Plural of Latin <em>magus</em>; Greek <em>magoi</em>).

<p>The "wise men from the East" who came to adore <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> (<a href="../bible/mat002.htm">Matthew 2</a>).

<p><a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> regard the <a href="../cathen/10057a.htm">Gospel</a> account as fiction; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> insist that it is a narrative of fact, supporting their interpretation with the evidence of all <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and versions, and patristic citations. All this evidence <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalists</a> pronounce irrelevant; they class the story of the Magi with the so-called "legends of the childhood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>", later <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> additions to the Gospels. Admitting only internal evidence, they say, this evidence does not stand the test of <a href="../cathen/04491c.htm">criticism</a>.

<ul> <li><em><a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">John</a> and <a href="../cathen/09674b.htm">Mark</a> are silent.</em> This is because they begin their Gospels with the public life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. That <a href="../cathen/08438a.htm">John</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the story of the Magi may be gathered from the fact that <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (Adv. Haer., III, ix, 2) is witness to it; for <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> gives us the Johannine tradition. <li><em>Luke is silent.</em> Naturally, as the fact is told well enough by the other synoptics. <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">Luke</a> tells the <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a>, details of the Nativity, the <a href="../cathen/03779a.htm">Circumcision</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03245b.htm">Presentation</a> of Christ in the Temple, facts of the childhood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> which the silence of the other three <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> does not render legendary. <li><em>Luke contradicts Matthew and returns the Child <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to Nazereth immediately after the Presentation (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs39">Luke 2:39</a>).</em> This return to <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> may have been either before the Magi came to Bethlehem or after the exile in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. No contradiction is involved.</ul>

<p>The subject will be treated in this article under the two divisions:<blockquote><p>I. Who the Magi were; <br>II. The Time and Circumstances of their Visit.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="section1">Who the <em>magi</em> were</h2>
<h3 id="A">Non-Biblical evidence</h3>

<p>We may form a conjecture by non-Biblical evidence of a probable meaning to the word <em>magoi</em>. Herodotus (I, ci) is our authority for supposing that the Magi were the sacred caste of the <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Medes</a>. They provided <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and, regardless of dynastic vicissitudes, ever kept up their dominating religious influence. To the head of this caste, Nergal Sharezar, Jeremias gives the title <em>Rab-Mag</em>, "Chief Magus" (<a href="../bible/jer039.htm#vrs3">Jeremiah 39:3</a>, <a href="../bible/jer039.htm#vrs13">39:13</a>, in Hebrew original &mdash; <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> and <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> translations are <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> here). After the downfall of <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrian</a> and <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> power, the religion of the Magi held sway in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. Cyrus completely conquered the sacred caste; his son Cambyses severely repressed it. The Magians revolted and set up Gaumata, their chief, as King of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> under the name of Smerdis. He was, however, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> (521 B.C.), and Darius became king. This downfall of the Magi was celebrated by a national Persian holiday called <em>magophonia</em> (Her., III, lxiii, lxxiii, lxxix). Still the religious influence of this <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> caste continued throughout the rule of the Achaemenian dynasty in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> (Ctesias, "Persica", X-XV); and is not unlikely that at the time of the birth of Christ it was still flourishing under the Parthian dominion. Strabo (XI, ix, 3) says that the Magian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> formed one of the two councils of the Parthian Empire.
<h3 id="B">Biblical evidence</h3>

<p>The word <em>magoi</em> often has the meaning of "magician", in both <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a> (see <a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs9">Acts 8:9</a>; <a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs6">13:6, 8</a>; also the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> of <a href="../bible/dan001.htm#vrs20">Daniel 1:20</a>; <a href="../bible/dan002.htm#vrs2">2:2</a>, <a href="../bible/dan002.htm#vrs10">2:10</a>, <a href="../bible/dan002.htm#vrs27">2:27</a>; <a href="../bible/dan004.htm#vrs4">4:4</a>; <a href="../bible/dan005.htm#vrs7">5:7</a>, <a href="../bible/dan005.htm#vrs11">5:11</a>, <a href="../bible/dan005.htm#vrs15">5:15</a>). <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> (Tryph., lxxviii), <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Cels., I, lx), <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (Serm. xx, De epiphania) and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (In Isa., xix, 1) find the same meaning in the second chapter of Matthew, though this is not the common interpretation.
<h3 id="C">Patristic evidence</h3>

<p>No <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Father of the Church</a> holds the Magi to have been kings. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> ("Adv. Marcion.", III, xiii) says that they were wellnigh kings (<em>fere reges</em>), and so agrees with what we have concluded from non-Biblical evidence. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, indeed, in her liturgy, applies to the Magi the words: "The kings of Tharsis and the islands shall offer presents; the kings of the Arabians and of <a href="../cathen/13285c.htm">Saba</a> shall bring him gifts: and all the kings of the earth shall adore him" (<a href="../bible/psa071.htm#vrs10">Psalm 71:10</a>). But this use of the text in reference to them no more proves that they were kings than it traces their journey from Tharsis, <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13285c.htm">Saba</a>. As sometimes happens, a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> accommodation of a text has in time come to be looked upon by some as an authentic interpretation thereof. Neither were they magicians: the good meaning of <em>magoi</em>, though found nowhere else in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, is demanded by the context of the second chapter of St. Matthew. These Magians can have been none other than members of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> caste already referred to. The religion of the Magi was fundamentally that of Zoroaster and forbade <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">sorcery</a>; their <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a> and skill in interpreting dreams were occasions of their finding Christ. (See <a href="../cathen/02154a.htm">THEOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE AVESTA</a>.)



<p>The Gospel narrative omits to mention the number of the Magi, and there is no certain tradition in this matter. Some Fathers speak of three Magi; they are very likely influenced by the number of gifts. In the Orient, tradition favours twelve. Early <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> is no consistent witness: <ul> <li>a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in the cemetery of Sts. Peter and Marcellinus shows two; <li>one in the Lateran Museum, three; <li>one in the cemetery of <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">Domitilla</a>, four; <li>a vase in the Kircher Museum, eight (Marucchi, "El&eacute;ments d'arch&eacute;ologie chr&eacute;tienne", Paris, 1899, I 197). </ul> The names of the Magi are as uncertain as is their number. Among the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latins</a>, from the seventh century, we find slight variants of the names, Gaspar, Melchior, and Balthasar; the Martyrology mentions St. Gaspar, on the first, St. Melchior, on the sixth, and St. Balthasar, on the eleventh of January (Acta SS., I, 8, 323, 664). The Syrians have Larvandad, Hormisdas, Gushnasaph, etc.; the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, Kagba, Badadilma, etc. (Cf. Acta Sanctorum, May, I, 1780). Passing over the purely legendary notion that they represented the three <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> which are descended from <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, it appears they all came from "the east" (<a href="../bible/mat002.htm#vrs1">Matthew 2:1, 2, 9</a>). East of Palestine, only ancient Media, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> had a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Magian <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> at the time of the birth of Christ. From some such part of the Parthian Empire the Magi came. They probably crossed the Syrian Desert, lying between the Euphrates and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, reached either Haleb (Aleppo) or Tudmor (Palmyra), and journeyed on to Damascus and southward, by what is now the great <a href="../cathen/10099a.htm">Mecca</a> route (<em>darb elhaj</em>, "the pilgrim's way"), keeping the <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Sea of Galilee</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> to their west till they crossed the ford near <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>. We have no tradition of the precise land meant by "the east". It is Babylon, according to St. Maximus (Homil. xviii in Epiphan.); and <a href="../cathen/14579a.htm">Theodotus of Ancyra</a> (Homil. de Nativitate, I, x); <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> (<a href="../fathers/02101.htm"><em>Stromata</em> I.15</a>) and <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">St. Cyril of Alexandria</a> (In Is., xlix, 12); Aribia, according to <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> (Cont. Tryphon., lxxvii), <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (Adv. Jud., ix), and <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> (Expos. fidei, viii).
<h2 id="section2">Time and circumstances of their visit</h2>

<p>The visit of the Magi took place after the Presentation of the Child in the Temple (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs38">Luke 2:38</a>). No sooner were the Magi departed than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> bade <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> take the Child and its Mother into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (<a href="../bible/mat002.htm#vrs13">Matthew 2:13</a>). Once <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> was wroth at the failure of the Magi to return, it was out of all question that the presentation should take place. Now a new difficulty occurs: after the presentation, the Holy Family returned into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs39">Luke 2:39</a>). Some think that this return was not immediate. Luke omits the incidents of the Magi, flight into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, massacre of the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Innocents</a>, and return from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and takes up the story with the return of the Holy Family into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. We prefer to interpret Luke's words as indicating a return to <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> immediately after the presentation. The stay at <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> was very brief. Thereafter the Holy Family probably returned to abide in <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>. Then the Magi came. It was "in the days of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">King Herod</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat002.htm#vrs1">Matthew 2:1</a>), i.e. before the year 4 B.C. (A.U.C. 750), the probable date of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> death at <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#II">Archelaus</a>, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> son, succeeded as ethnarch to a part of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> realm, and was deposed either in his ninth (Josephus, Bel. Jud., II, vii, 3) or tenth (Josephus, Antiq., XVII, xviii, 2) year of office during the consulship of Lepidus and Arruntius (Dion Cassis, lv, 27), i.e., A.D. 6. Moreover, the Magi came while <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">King Herod</a> was in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (vv. 3, 7), not in <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, i.e., either the beginning of 4 B.C. or the end of 5 B.C. Lastly, it was probably a year, or a little more than a year, after the birth of Christ. <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> had found out from the Magi the time of the star's appearance. Taking this for the time of the Child's birth, he slew the male children of two years old and under in <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a> and its borders (v. 16). Some of the Fathers conclude from this ruthless slaughter that the Magi reached <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> two years after the Nativity (St. Epiphanius, "Haer.", LI, 9; Juvencus, "Hist. Evang.", I, 259). Their conclusion has some degree of probability; yet the slaying of children two years old may possibly have been due to some other reason &mdash; for instance, a fear on <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> part that the Magi had deceived him in the matter of the star's appearance or that the Magi had been deceived as to the conjunction of that appearance with the birth of the Child. Art and arch&aelig;ology favour our view. Only one early monument represents the Child in the crib while the Magi adore; in others <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> rests upon Mary's knees and is at times fairly well grown (see <a href="../cathen/04378a.htm">Cornely</a>, "Introd. Special. in N.T.", p. 203).

<p>From <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, whence the Magi are supposed to have come, to Jerusalem was a journey of between 1000 and 1200 miles. Such a distance may have taken any time between three and twelve months by camel. Besides the time of travel, there were probably many weeks of preparation. The Magi could scarcely have reached <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> till a year or more had elapsed from the time of the apperance of the star. St. Augustine (De Consensu Evang., II, v, 17) thought the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the Epiphany, the sixth of January, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the Magi reached Bethlehem thirteen days after the Nativity, i.e., after the twenty-fifth of December. His argument from <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> dates was incorrect. Neither <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> date is certainly the historical date. (For an explanation of the chronological difficulties, see Chronology, Biblical, <em>Date of the Nativity of Jesus Christ</em>.) In the fourth century the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Churches of the Orient</a> celebrated the sixth of January as the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">feast of Christ's Birth</a>, the Adoration by the Magi, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Baptism, whereas, in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Occident</a>, the Birth of Chirst was celebrated on the twenty-fifth of December. This latter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the Nativity was introduced into the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a> during <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom's</a> time (P.G., XLIX, 351), and still later into the Churches of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>.

<p>That the Magi thought a star led them on, is clear from the words (<em>eidomen gar autou ton astera</em>) which Matthew uses in 2:2. Was it really a star? <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> and <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, in their efforts to escape the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, have elaborated a number of hypotheses: <ul> <li>The word <em>aster</em> may mean a comet; the star of the Magi was a comet. But we have no record of any such comet. <li>The star may have been a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn (7 B.C.), or of Jupiter and Venus (6 B.C.). <li>The Magi may have seen a <em>stella nova</em>, a star which suddenly increases in magnitude and brilliancy and then fades away. </ul>

<p>These theories all fail to explain how "the star which they had seen in the east, went before them, until it came and stood over where the child was" (<a href="../bible/mat002.htm#vrs9">Matthew 2:9</a>). The position of a fixed star in the heavens varies at most one degree each day. No fixed star could have so moved before the Magi as to lead them to Bethlehem; neither fixed star nor comet could have disappeared, and reappeared, and stood still. Only a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> phenomenon could have been the Star of Bethlehem. it was like the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> <a href="../cathen/12099b.htm">pillar of fire</a> which stood in the camp by night during <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel's</a> Exodus (<a href="../bible/exo013.htm#vrs21">Exodus 13:21</a>), or to the "brightness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" which shone round about the shepherds (<a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs9">Luke 2:9</a>), or to "the light from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>" which shone around about the stricken Saul (<a href="../bible/act009.htm#vrs3">Acts 9:3</a>).

<p>The philosophy of the Magi, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> though it was, led them to the journey by which they were to find Christ. Magian <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a> postulated a heavenly counterpart to complement man's earthly self and make up the complete human <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>. His "double" (the <em>fravashi</em> of the Parsi) developed together with every good man until death united the two. The sudden appearance of a new and brilliant star suggested to the Magi the birth of an important <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. They came to adore him &mdash; i.e., to acknowledge the Divinity of this newborn King (vv. 2, 8, 11). Some of the Fathers (St. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, "Adv. Haer.", III, ix, 2; Progem. "in Num.", homil. xiii, 7) think the Magi saw in "his star" a fulfilment of the prophesy of <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a>: "A star shall rise out of Jacob and a sceptre shall spring up from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>" (<a href="../bible/num024.htm#vrs17">Numbers 24:17</a>). But from the parallelism of the prophesy, the "Star" of <a href="../cathen/02214b.htm">Balaam</a> is a great prince, not a heavenly body; it is not likely that, in virtue of this <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> prophesy, the Magi would look forward to a very special star of the <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a> as a sign of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>. It is likely, however, that the Magi were familiar with the great <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> prophesies. Many <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> did not return from exile with Nehemias. When Christ was born, there was undoubtedly a Hebrew population in Babylon, and probably one in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. At any rate, the Hebrew tradition survived in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. Moreover, Virgil, Horace, Tacitus (Hist., V, xiii), and Suetonius (Vespas., iv) bear witness that, at the time of the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, there was throughout the Roman Empire a general unrest and expectation of a Golden Age and a great deliverer. We may readily admit that the Magi were led by such hebraistic and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">gentile</a> influences to look forward to a <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a> who should soon come. But there must have been some special <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a> whereby they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that "his star" meant the birth of a king, that this new-born king was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">very God</a>, and that they should be led by "his star" to the place of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">God-King's</a> birth (<a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">St. Leo</a>, Serm. xxxiv, "In Epiphan." IV, 3).

<p>The advent of the Magi caused a great stir in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; everybody, even <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">King Herod</a>, heard their quest (v. 3). <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should have been gladdened at the news; they were saddened. It is a striking fact that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> showed the Magi the way, but would not go that way themselves. The Magi now followed the star some six miles southward to <a href="../cathen/02532e.htm">Bethlehem</a>, "and entering into the house [<em>eis ten oikian</em>], they found the child" (v. 11). There is no reason to suppose, with some of the Fathers (St. Aug., Serm. cc, "In Epiphan.", I, 2), that the Child was still in the stable. The Magi adored (<em>prosekynesan</em>) the Child as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and offered Him gold, frankincense, and myrrh. The giving of gifts was in keeping with Oriental custom. The purpose of the gold is clear; the Child was poor. We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the purpose of the other gifts. The Magi probably meant no symbolism. The Fathers have found manifold and multiform symbolic meanings in the three gifts; it is not clear that any of these meanings are inspired (cf. Knabenbauer, "in Matth.", 1892).

<p>We are certain that the Magi were told in sleep not to return to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and that "they went back another way into their country" (v. 12). This other way may have been a way to the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> such as to avoid <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>; or a roundabout way south through Beersheba, then east to the great highway (now the Mecca route) in the land of <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> and beyond the Dead Sea. It is said that after their return home, the Magi were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by St. Thomas and wrought much for the spread of the Faith in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The story is traceable to an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> writer of not earlier than the sixth century, whose work is printed, as "Opus imperfectum in Matth&aelig;um" among the writings of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> (P.G., LVI, 644). This author admits that he is drawing upon the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Book of Seth, and writes much about the Magi that is clearly legendary. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Cologne contains what are claimed to be the remains of the Magi; these, it is said, were discovered in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, brought to Constantinople by St. Helena, transferred to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> in the fifth century and to Cologne in 1163 (Acta SS., I, 323).
