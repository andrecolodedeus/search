<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Magnificat</h1>  

<p>The title commonly given to the Latin text and vernacular translation of the Canticle (or Song) of Mary. It is the opening word of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> text (<a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs46">Luke 1:46-55</a>): "Magnificat anima mea, Dominum", etc. (My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> doth magnify the Lord, etc.). In ancient <a href="../cathen/01576b.htm">antiphonaries</a> it was often styled <em>Evangelium Mari&aelig;</em>, the "Gospel of Mary". In the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> it is entitled (<a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> for Sunday) <em>Canticum B.M.V.</em> (Canticle of the Blessed Virgin Mary). The "Magnificat", "Benedictus" (Canticle of Zachary &mdash; <a href="../bible/luk001.htm#vrs68">Luke 1:68-79</a>), and "Nunc Dimittis" (Canticle of Simeon &mdash; <a href="../bible/luk002.htm#vrs29">Luke 2:29-32</a>) are also styled "evangelical canticles", as they are found in the Gospel (<em>Evangelium</em>) of St. Luke.
<h2>Form and content</h2>

<p>Commentators divide it into three or four stanzas, of which easily accessible illustrations may be found in McEvilly, "Exposition of the Gospel of St. Luke" (triple-division: verses 46-49, 50-53, 54-55); in Maas, "Life of Jesus Christ" (also triple, but slightly different: vv. 46-50, 51-43, 54-55); and in Schaff and Riddle, "Popular Commentary on the New Testament" (division into four stanzas: vv. 46-48, 49-50, 51-52, 53-55). The Magnificat is in many places very similar in thought and phrase to the Canticle of Anna (<a href="../bible/1sa002.htm#vrs1">1 Samuel 2:1-10</a>), and to various psalms (xxxiii, 3-5; xxxiv, 9; cxxxvii, 6; lxx, 19; cxxv, 2-3; cx, 9; xcvii, 1; cxvii, 16; xxxii, 10; cxii, 7; xxxii, 11; xcvii, 3; cxxxi, 11). Similarities are found with Hab., iii, 18; Mal., iii, 12; <a href="../bible/job005.htm#vrs11">Job 5:11</a>; <a href="../bible/isa012.htm#vrs8">Isaiah 12:8</a> and <a href="../bible/isa049.htm#vrs3">49:3</a>; <a href="../bible/gen017.htm#vrs19">Genesis 17:19</a>. Steeped thus in Scriptural thought and phraseology, summing up in its inspired <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> the economy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with His Chosen People, indicating the fulfillment of the olden prophecy and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophesying</a> anew until the end of time, the Magnificat is the crown of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> singing, the last canticle of the Old and the first of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. It was uttered (or, not improbably, chanted) by the Blessed Virgin, when she visited her cousin Elizabeth under the circumstances narrated by St. Luke in the first chapter of his Gospel. It is an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> of praise for the inestimable favour bestowed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on the Virgin, for the mercies shown to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and for the fulfillment of the promises made to Abraham and to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>. Only four points of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> will be noted here. Some commentators distinguish the meaning of "soul" (or "intellect") and "spirit" (or "will") in the first two verses; but, in view of Hebrew usage, probably both words mean the same thing, "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with all its faculties". In v. 48, "humility" probably means the "low estate", or "lowliness", rather than the virtue of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>. The second half of v. 48 utters a prophecy which has been fulfilled ever since, and which adds to the overwhelming reasons for rejecting the Elizabethan authorship of the canticle. Finally the first half of v. 55 (As he spoke to our fathers) is probably parenthetical.
<h2>Marian authorship</h2>

<p>The past decade has witnessed a discussion of the authorship of the Magnificat, based on the fact that three ancient <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> (Vercellensis, Veronensis, Rhedigerianus) have: "Et ait Elisabeth: Magnificat anima mea", etc. (And Elizabeth said: My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> doth magnify, etc.); and also on some very slight patristic use of the variant reading. Harnack in "Berliner Sitzungsberichte" (17 May, 1900), 538-56, announced his view of the Elizabethan authorship, contending that the original reading is neither "Mary" nor "Elizabeth", but merely "she" (said). About two years previously, Durand had criticized, in the "Revue Biblique", the argument of Jacob&eacute; for a probable ascription to Elizabeth. Dom Morin had called attention ("Revue Biblique", 1897) to the words of Nicetas (Niceta) of <a href="../cathen/12763a.htm">Remesiana</a>, in a Vatican <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of his "De psalmodi&aelig; bono": "Cum Helisabeth Dominum anima nostra magnificat" (With Elizabeth our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> doth magnify the Lord). The works of Nicetas have been edited recently by Burn, and give (De psalmodi&aelig; bono, ix, xi) evidence of Nicetas's view (see note 4, p. 79, ibid.). In the introduction to Burn's volume, Burkit rejects the reading "Et ait Elisabeth" as wholly untenable in view of the contradictory testimony of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and of all the Greek and Syriac texts, but contends for the original reading "she" (said) and for the Elizabethan authorship. He is answered by the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a>, who supports the probability of an original reading "she", but rejects the ascription to Elizabeth (pp. clv-clviii). The witness of the <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> and of the Fathers is practically unanimous for the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> reading: "Et ait Maria"; but, apart from this, the attribution of the Magnificat to Elizabeth would, in St. Luke's context, be highly abnormal. Long before the recent discussion, Westcott and Hort, in the appendix (52) to their "Introduction to the New Testament in the Original Greek" (New York, 1882), had briefly discussed and rejected the reading "Elisabeth"; and this rejection is summarily confirmed in their revised text of the "N. T. in the Original Greek" (London, 1895), 523.
<h2>Liturgical use</h2>

<p>While the canticles taken by the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> are located with the psalms, and are so distributed as to be sung only once a week, the Magnificat shares with the other two "evangelical canticles" the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of a daily recitation and of a singularly prominent location immediately before the <em>Oratio</em>, or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> of the daily Office (or, if there be <em>preces</em>, immediately before these). The "Magnificat" is assigned to <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, the "Benedictus" to <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>, and the "Nunc Dimittis" to <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a>. Six reasons are given by Durandus for the assignment of the Magnificat to <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, the first being that the world was saved in its eventide by the assent of Mary to the Divine plan of Redemption. Another reason is found by Colvenarius in the probability that it was towards evening when <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> arrived at the house of St. Elizabeth. However this may be, in the Rule (written before 502) of St. C&aelig;sarius of Arles, the earliest extant account of its <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> use, it is assigned to <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>, as it is in the Greek Churches of to-day. The ceremonies attending its singing in the choir at solemn <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> are notably impressive. At the intonation "Magnificat", all who are in the sanctuary arise, and the celebrant (having first removed his biretta "in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the canticles") goes with his assistants to the altar, where, with the customary reverences, etc., he <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blesses</a> the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incenses</a> the altar as at the beginning of solemn Mass. In order to permit the elaborate <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensing</a>, the Magnificat is sung much more slowly than the psalms. A similar <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> attends the singing of the Benedictus at solemn <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>, but not of the Nunc Dimittis at <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a>.

<p>At the first word of the Magnificat and of the Benedictus (but not of the Nunc Dimittis, save where custom has made it lawful) the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">Sign of the Cross</a> is made. In some churches the Magnificat is sung at devotions outside of <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>. Answering a question from <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, the "Ecclesiastical Review" (XXIII, 74) declares that the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> allow such a separation, but forbids the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensing</a> of the altar in such a case. The same review (XXIII, 173) remarks that "the practice of making the Sign of the Cross at the opening of the Magnificat, the <a href="../cathen/02473a.htm">Benedictus</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11159a.htm">Nunc Dimittis</a> in the Office is of very ancient usage, and is sanctioned by the very best authority", and refers to the Congregation of Sacred Rites, 20 December, 1861.
<h2>Musical settings</h2>

<p>Like the canticles and psalms, the Magnificat is preceeded and followed by an antiphon varying for the feast or <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferial</a> Office, and is sung to the eight modes of plain song. The first verse has, however, no mediation, because of the brevity (the one word <em>Magnificat</em>) of the first half. The Canticles of Mary and of Zachary share (even in the <a href="../cathen/11220a.htm">Office of the Dead</a>) the peculiar <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of commencing every verse with an <em>initium</em> or intonation. This intonation varies for the varying modes; and the Magnificat has a special solemn intonation for the second, seventh, and eighth modes, although in this case the usual festive intonation applies, in the second and eighth modes, to all the verses except the first. The "musical", as distinguished from the "plainsong", treating of the canticle has been very varied. Sometimes the chanted verses alternated with harmonized <a href="../cathen/12144a.htm">plainsong</a>, sometimes with <em>falso bordone</em> having original melodies in the same mode as the plain song. But there are innumerable settings which are entirely original, and which run through the whole range of musical expression, from the simplest harmony up to the most elaborate dramatic treatment, with orchestral accompaniment of the text. Almost every great church composer has worked often and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> on this theme. <a href="../cathen/11421b.htm">Palestrina</a> published two settings in each of the eight modes, and left in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> almost as many more. Fifty settings by Orlando di Lasso are in the Royal Library at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and tradition credits him with twice as many more. In our own days, C&eacute;sar Franck (1822-90) is said to have completed sixty-three out of the hundred he had planned. In addition to such names as <a href="../cathen/11421b.htm">Palestrina</a>, di Lasso, Josquin des Pr&eacute;s, <a href="../cathen/16064a.htm">Morales</a>, Goudimal, <a href="../cathen/01530a.htm">Animuccia</a>, Vittoria, Anerio, Gabrieli, Suriano, who with their contemporaries contributed innumerable settings, the modern Cecilian School has done much work on the Magnificat both as a separate canticle, and as one of the numbers in a "Complete <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>" of many feasts. In <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> services the Magnificat receives a musical treatment not different from that accorded to the other canticles, and therefore quite dissimilar to that for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, in which the length of time consumed in <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensing</a> the altar allows much greater musical elaboration. A glance through the pages of Novello's catalogue of "Services" leads to the estimate of upwards of one thousand settings of the Magnificat for <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> services by a single publishing house. Altogether, the estimate of Krebbiel that this canticle "has probably been set to music oftener than any <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> in the liturgy" seems well within the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.
