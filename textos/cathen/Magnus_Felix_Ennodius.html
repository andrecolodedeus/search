<h1>Magnus Felix Ennodius</h1>  

<p>Rhetorician and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, b. probably at Arles, in Southern Gaul, in 474; d. at <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 17 July, 521. When quite young he went to <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, was <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, and eventually became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, his fiancee at the same time becoming a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>. It does not appear certain that he ever married. Shortly after the death of his benefactor, Epiphanius (496), he received <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, attracted thither no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> by his uncle Laurentius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city. Soon he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and taught in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. About this time (498) two <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> were elected simultaneously, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Symmachus and the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> Laurentius. <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">King Theodoric</a> was in favour of the former, and convened a council at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 501, the famous <em>Synodus Palmaris</em>, to settle this question and put an end to much <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. On this occasion Ennodius acted as secretary to Laurentius of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, who was the first to sign the decrees of the council. The adherents of the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> Laurentius, who was rejected by the council, wrote against the decisions of the latter. Ennodius answered them and defended the synod in a still extant work entitled "Libellus adversus cos qui contra synodum scribere praesumpserunt". After referring to the objections urged against the incompetency and irregularity of the council, he attacks the enemies of Symmachus and proclaims the inability of human judges to decide matters pertaining to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>: "God no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> consented to the affairs of men being settled by men; He reserved to Himself the passing of judgment upon the pontiff of the supreme see" (Libellus, sect. 93). In 513 Ennodius was still at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, but shortly afterwards he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>. In 515 and 517 he headed two successive embassies which Pope Hormisdas sent to Emperor Anastasius at Constantinople, both of which, however, were barren of results. The unrelenting enmity of the emperor endangered the lives of the envoys in 517. Of the remaining years of his episcopate nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. His epitaph, found by accident, gives the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death.

<p>The works of Ennodius comprise poems for special occasions and epigrams, particularly inscriptions for churches or other religious monuments. His defence of the synod of 502, often known as "Libellus pro Synodo", his autobiography (Eucharisticum), his panegyric on <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">King Theodoric</a>, and the biographies of his predecessor Epiphanius of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, Antonius of L&eacute;rins, are interesting from an historical point of view; the first four especially. As much can be said of his numerous letters, addressed to various correspondents. Notwithstanding their verbosity, they contain much useful information concerning the addresses and the customs of the time. Ennodius is the last representative of the ancient <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of rhetoric. His "Paraenesis didascalica" (511) celebrates the wonderful power of that foremost of the liberal arts, by which a guilty man is made to appear innocent, and vice versa. He illustrates his own method in a few declamatory exercises called "Dictiones"; they deal with themes once the delight of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> rhetoricians, e.g. grief of Thetis on beholding the corpse of Achilles; Menclaus contemplating the ruins of Troy; the lament of Dido forsaken by &AElig;neas, etc. Again, with all the resources of his rhetoric he denounces a man who placed a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Minerva in a place of ill-repute; a player who gambled away the field in which his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> lay buried; etc. He shared the popular fallacy of his contemporaries who saw in the reign of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> a revival of the Roman Empire under the control of men of letters. Ennodius remained to the end faithful to the academic traditions of the Roman <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, whose mythological apparatus he was the last to retain; thus in an epithalamium he describes the beauty of the nude Venus, and makes <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> argue against virginity. Nevertheless, he refutes elsewhere the fables of the poets and points out that the understanding of the <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Christian Scriptures</a> is the highest <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> ideal. In him are visible the two tendencies whose conflict is never quite absent from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life; outwardly he remains <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to classic tradition. His diction is exuberant and florid, but occasionally manifests vigour. The best editions of his writings are those of Hartel, in the sixth volume of the "Corpus ecclesiasticorum latinorum" (Vienna, 1881), and of Vogel in "Monumenta Germaniae Hist.: Auct." (Berlin, 1885), VII.
