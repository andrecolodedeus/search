<h1>Majordomo</h1>  

<p>(Latin, <em>Major domus</em>; Italian, <em>Maggiordomo</em>).

<p>The majordomo or chief steward of the household of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is one of the three (formerly four) palatine <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> (prelati palatini), concerning whom particulars have been given in the article <a href="../cathen/09521b.htm">MAESTRO DI CAMERA</a>. He belongs also to the four <em>"prelati di fiocchetto"</em>, so called because they have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to ornament the harness of their horses with violet and peacock-coloured feathers. The four <em><a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> di fiocchetto</em> are, first the Governor of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in his quality of Vice-Chamberlain, and after him the Auditor and the Treasurer of the Apostolic chamber, and then comes the Major-domo. In the "Introitus et Exitus Camer&aelig; Apostolic&aelig;" of the Vatican Archives, which begins with the year 1295, the officials of the Apostolic Household are given in regular order according to their stipends. But, although even at this <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> there undoubtedly existed a supreme steward of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> palace, the name and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> attached to the office of a majordomo were not strictly defined until later. The alterations in the domestic administration of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> household, necessitated under <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> and <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> by the transition from the "natural economy" to the "economy of money", were of a far-reaching nature; but it was only after the return of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> from <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in 1418 that the present offices were gradually evolved, to attain subsequently during the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> a full developmnent. In the sixteenth century a <em>maestro di casa</em> stood at the head of the whole administration of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> household. Towards the end of that century the same official was accorded the title of <em>prefetto del Sacro Palazzo Apostolico</em>, and under <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> (1623-44) he was first granted the title of <em>Maggiordomo Pontificio</em>. It was then his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, on the accession of a new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, to form the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <em>famiglia</em>, that is, to suggest candidates for the various household offices and then to direct the whole household. In so far as this <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> necessitated expenditure, the Treasurer of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy Roman Church</a>, the minister of finance for the time being, exercised sharply defined control over the majordomo and his assistants. This circumstance did not, however, constitute the treasurer a household official, or the <em>Pr&aelig;fectus Sacri Palatii</em> and administrative official; the Majordomo is, and has always been, exclusively a household official. A complete list of the occupants of the office from 1534 is preserved. The general rule recognised by the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> at the close of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, that the head of any important, department should have <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all his assistants, extended to the Majordomo. Not merely in civil matters but likewise in criminal charges, <em>sedebat pro tribunali</em> &#151; he pronounced judgment on all officials of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> palace. In the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as majordomo were sharply distinguished from those which he performed as Prefect of the Palace, so that the majordomo was said to be simultaneously Prefect of the Palace. To the prefecture belonged the management of the museums and of all establishments of a special kind existing in the palaces--provided they were not autonomous. The keeping of the palace accounts also fell to the prefect.

<p>After 1870 there was a great change in these conditions. The important office of the prefect was separated from that of the majordomo, and entrusted to the commission of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> appointed to administer the business affairs of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The arrangement of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> was so far altered by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, that the Secretary of State was made Prefect of the Apostolic Palaces. Subordinate to him are the subprefect, the forriere maggiore, the cavallerizzo maggiore, the segreteria della prefettiora, the computisteria, the architetto and the juristic counsellors, who form in their corporate capacity, the divisional boards of direction of the palace administration. The museums and galleries are also entrusted to this body. The above-mentioned alteration by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> took place on 29 Dec., 1891, after the prefecture had been separated by a <em>Motus proprius</em> of 7 December. The present <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the Majordomo are briefly as follows: He enjoys his old privilege of accompanying His Holiness, and remains Governor of the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">Conclave</a>. In this capacity he has the general control of the personnel of the palaces, and is responsible for the quiet and good order therein during the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">Conclave</a>. In the <em>Congresso Palatino</em> (Palatine Commission), should it be hereafter convened, he has a seat and a vote. He conducts the Congregation of the Apostolic Hospice, and is director of the <em><a href="../cathen/14029b.htm">Cappella Sistina</a></em>, the musical direction of which is (1910) entrusted to Maestro Perosi. All ordinary and extraordinary religious functions, in which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court participate, are under his arrangement and direction. The appointments of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chamberlains are forwarded by him at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> order, and he distributes the annual medals to the members of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> household. His earlier <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of issuing cards of admission to the galleries and museums for purposes of study and copying is now withdrawn from him. The Majordomo is the chief Prelate of the Household, has a distinctive dress, and enjoys a free official residence in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> palace.
