<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Malabar Rites</h1>  

<p>A conventional term for certain customs or practices of the natives of South <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries allowed their <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> to retain after conversion, but which were afterwards prohibited by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The missions concerned are not those of the coast of southwestern <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, to which the name Malabar properly belongs, but those of inner South <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, especially those of the former "kingdoms" of Madura, <a href="../cathen/10661d.htm">Mysore</a> and the Karnatic.

<p>The question of <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a> Rites originated in the method followed by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, since the beginning of the seventeenth century, in evangelizing those countries. The prominent feature of that method was a condescending accommodation to the manners and customs of the people the conversion of whom was to be obtained. But, when bitter enemies asserted, as some still assert, that the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries, in Madura, <a href="../cathen/10661d.htm">Mysore</a> and the Karnatic, either accepted for themselves or permitted to their <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> such practices as they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> or <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a>, this accusation must be styled not only <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, but absurd. In fact it is tantamount to affirming that these men, whose intelligence at least was never questioned, were so stupid as to jeopardize their own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in order to save others, and to endure <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> hardships in order to establish among the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a> a corrupt and sham <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, while disapproving of some usages hitherto considered inoffensive or tolerable by the missionaries, never charged them having adulterated knowingly the purity of religion. On one of them, who had observed the "Malabar Rites" for seventeen years previous to his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has conferred the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a>. The process for the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> of <a href="../cathen/08461a.htm">Father John de Britto</a> was going on at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> during the hottest period of the controversy upon the famous "Rites"; and the adversaries of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> asserted <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> to be impossible, because it would amount to approving the "superstitions and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatries</a>" maintained by the missioners of Madura. Yet the cause progressed, and <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, on 2 July, 1741, declared "that the rites in question had not been used, as among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, with religious significance, but merely as civil observances, and that therefore they were no obstacle to bringing forward the process". (Brief of Beatification of John de Britto, 18 May, 1852.) There is no reason to view the "Malabar Rites", as practised generally in the said missions, in any other light. Hence the <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> of the missionaries in tolerating the native customs should not be contested; on the other hand, they, no doubt, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> in carrying this toleration too far. But the bare enumeration of the Decrees by which the question was decided shows how perplexing it was and how difficult the solution.
<h2>Father de Nobili's work</h2>

<p>The founder of the missions of the interior of South <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, Roberto de Nobili, was born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 1577, of a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> from <a href="../cathen/10531a.htm">Montepulciano</a>, which numbered among many distinguised relatives the celebrated Cardinal Roberto <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>. When nineteen years of age, he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>; and, after a few years, the young religious, aiming at the purest ideal of self-sacrifice, requested his superiors to send him to the missions of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. He embarked at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, 1604, and in 1606 was serving his apostolic apprenticeship in South <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was then flourishing on the coasts of this country. It is well known that <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> many thousands there, and from the apex of the Indian triangle the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> spread along both sides, especially on the west, the Malabar coast. But the interior of the vast peninsula remained almost untouched. The Apostle of the Indies himself recognized the insuperable opposition of the "Brahmins and other noble castes inhabiting the interior" to the preaching of the Gospel (Monumenta Xaveriana, I, 54). Yet his disciples were not sparing of endeavours. A Portuguese <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Gonsalvo Fernandes, had resided in the city of Madura fully fourteen years, having obtained leave of the king to stay there to watch over the spiritual needs of a few <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from the coast; and, though a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> missionary, he had not succeeded, within that long space of time, in making one convert. This painful state of things Nobili witnessed in 1606, when together with his superior, the Provincial of Malabar, he paid a visit to Fernandes. At once his keen eye perceived the cause and the remedy.

<p>It was evident that a deep-rooted aversion to the foreign preachers hindered the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a> of the interior, not only from accepting the Gospel, but even from listening to its message. But whence this aversion? Its object was not exactly the foreigner, but the Prangui. This name, with which the natives of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> designed the Portuguese, conveyed to their minds the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of an <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> and abject class of men, with whom no <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> could have any intercourse without degrading himself to the lowest ranks of the population. Now the Prangui were abominated because they violated the most respected customs of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, by eating beef, and indulging in wine and spirits; but much as all well-bred <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a> abhorred those things, they felt more disgusted at seeing the Portuguese, irrespective of any distinction of caste, treat freely with the lowest classes, such as the pariahs, who in the eyes of their countrymen of the higher castes, are nothing better than the vilest animals. Accordingly, since Fernandes was known to be a Portuguese, that is a Prangui, and besides was seen living habitually with the men of the lowest caste, the religion he preached, no less than himself, had to share the contempt and execration attending his <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a>, and made no progress whatever among the better classes. To become acceptable to all, Christanity must be presented to all, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> must be presented in quite another way. While Nobili thought over his plan, probably the example just set by his countryman <a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Matteo Ricci</a>, in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, stood before his mind. At all events, he started from the same principle, resolving to become, after the motto of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, all things to all men, and a <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>, as far as might be lawful.



<p>Having ripened his design by thorough meditation and by conferring with his superiors, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cranganore and the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of Malabar, who both approved and encouraged his resolution, Nobili boldly began his arduous career by re-entering Madura in the dress of the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> ascetics, known as <em>saniassy</em>. He never tried to make believe that he was a native of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>; else he would have deserved the name of imposter; with which he has sometimes been unjustly branded; but he availed himself of the fact that he was not a Portuguese, to deprecate the opprobrious name Prangui. He introduced himself as a Roman raja (nobleman), desirous of living at Madura in practising penance, in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> and studying the sacred law. He carefully avoided meeting with Father Fernandes and he took his lodging in a solitary abode in the Brahmins' quarter obtained from the benevolence of a high officer. At first he called himself a raja, but soon he changed this title for that of brahmin, better suited to his aims. The rajas or kshatryas, being the second of the three high castes, formed the military class; but <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> avocations were almost monopolized by the Brahmins. They held from time immemorial the spiritual if not the political government of the nation, and were the arbiters of what the others ought to believe, to revere, and to adore. Yet, it must be noted, they were in no wise a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> caste; they were possessed of no exclusive right to perform functions of religious cult. Nobili remained for a long time shut up in his dwelling, after the custom of Indian penitents, living on rice, milk, and herbs with water, and that once a day; he received attendance only from Brahmin servants. Curiosity could not fail to be raised, and all the more as the foreign <em>saniassy</em> was very slow in satisfying it. When, after two or three refusals, he admitted visitors, the interview was conducted according to the strictest rules of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> etiquette. Nobili charmed his audience by the perfection with which he spoke their own language, Tamil; by the quotations of famous Indian authors with which he interspersed his discourse, and above all, by the fragments of native poetry which he recited or even sang with exquisite skill.

<p>Having thus won a benevolent hearing, he proceeded step by step on his missionary task, labouring first to set right the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of his auditors with respect to natural <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, etc., and then instilling by degrees the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>. He took advantage also of his acquaintance with the books revered by the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a> as sacred and divine. These he contrived, the first of all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a>, to read and study in the Sanskrit originals. For this purpose he had engaged a reputed Brahmin teacher, with whose assistance and by the industry of his own keen <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and felicitous memory he gained such a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this recondite literature as to strike the native <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> with amazement, very few of them feeling themselves capable of vying with him on the point. In this way also he was enabled to find in the Vedas many <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which he used in testimony of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> he preached. By this method, and no less by the prestige of his pure and austere life, the missionary had soon dispelled the distrust and before the end of 1608, he conferred <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> on several <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> conspicuous for nobility and learning. While he <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> his <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> to reject all practices involving <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> or savouring in any wise of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> worship, he allowed them to keep their national customs, in as far as these contained nothing wrong and referred to merely political or civil usages. Accordingly, Nobili's disciples continued for example, wearing the dress proper to each one's caste; the Brahmins retaining their <em>codhumbi</em> (tuft of hair) and cord (cotton string slung over the left shoulder); all adorning as before, their foreheads with sandalwood paste, etc. yet, one condition was laid on them, namely, that the cord and sandal, if once taken with any <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, be removed and replaced by others with a special benediction, the formula of which had been sent to Nobili by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cranganore.

<p>While the missionary was winning more and more esteem, not only for himself, but also for the Gospel, even among those who did not receive it, the fanatical <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> and votaries of the national gods, whom he was going to supplant, could not watch his progress quietly. By their assaults, indeed, his work was almost unceasingly impeded, and barely escaped ruin on several occasions; but he held his ground in spite of <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, menaces of death and all kinds of ill-treatment. In April, 1609, the flock which he had gathered around him was too numerous for his <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and required a church; and the labour of the ministry had become so crushing that he entreated the provincial to send him a companion. But then fell on him a storm from a part whence it might least have been expected. Fernandes, the missioner already mentioned, may have felt no mean jealousy, when seeing Nobili succeed so happily where he had been so powerless; but certainly he <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> unable to understand or to appreciate the method of his colleague; probably, also, as he had lived perforce apart from the circles among which the latter was working, he was never well informed of his doings. However, that may be, Fernandes directed to the superiors of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a lengthy report, in which he charged Nobili with simulation, in declining the name of Prangui; with connivance at <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, in allowing his <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> to observe <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> customs, such as wearing the insignia of castes; lastly, with <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> proceeding, in dividing the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> into separate congregations. This denunciation at first caused an impression highly unfavourable to Nobili. Influenced by the account of Fernandes, the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of Malabar (Father Laerzio, who had always countenanced Nobili, had then left that office), the Visitor of the <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> Missions and even the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> sent severe warnings to the missionary innovator. Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, in 1612, wrote to his relative, expressing the grief he felt on hearing of his unwise conduct.

<p>Things changed as soon as Nobili, being informed of the accusation, could answer it on every point. By oral explanations, in the assemblies of missionaries and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> at <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a> and at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, and by an elaborate memoir, which he sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he justified the manner in which he had presented himself to the Brahmins of Madura; then, he showed that the national customs he allowed his converts to keep were such as had no religious meaning. The latter point, the crux of the question, he elucidated by numerous quotations from the authoritative Sanskrit law-books of the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>. Moreover, he procured affidavits of one hundred and eight Brahmins, from among the most learned in Madura, all endorsing his interpretation of the native practices. He acknowledged that the infidels used to associate those practices with <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> ceremonies; but, he observed, "these ceremonies belong to the mode, not to the substance of the practices; the same difficulty may be raised about eating, drinking, marriage, etc., for the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> mix their ceremonies with all their actions. It suffices to do away with the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> ceremonies, as the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> do". As to <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, he denied having caused any such thing: "he had founded a new <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, which never could have been brought together with the older: the separation of the churches had been approved by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cranganore; and it precluded neither unity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> nor <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity, for his <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> used to greet kindly those of F. Fernandes. Even on the coast there are different churches for different castes, and in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the places in the churches are not common for all." Nobili's apology was effectually seconded by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cranganore, who, as he had encouraged the first steps of the missionary, continued to stand firmly by his side, and pleaded his cause warmly at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> before the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, as well as at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Thus the learned and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, Alexis de Menezes, though a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held by him had prohibited the Brahmin cord, was won over to the cause of Nobili. And his successor, Christopher de Sa, having thought fit to take a contrary course, remained almost the only opponent in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>.

<p>At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the explanations of Nobili, of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cranganore, and of the chief Inquisitor of <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> brought about a similar effect. In 1614 and 1615 Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> and the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> wrote again to the missionary, declaring themselves fully satisfied. At last, after the usual mature examination by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, on 31 January, 1623, <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>, by his Apostolic Letter, "Romanae Sedis Antistes", decided the question provisionally in favour of Father de Nobili. Accordingly, the <em>codhumbi</em>, the cord, the sandal, and the baths were permitted to the Indian <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, "until the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> provide otherwise"; only certain conditions are prescribed, in order that all <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> admixture and all occasion of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> may be averted. As to the separation of the castes, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> confines himself to "earnestly entreating and beseeching (<em>etiam atque etiam obtestamur et obsecramus</em>) the nobles not to despise the lower people, especially in the churches, by hearing the Divine word and receiving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> apart from them". Indeed, a strict order to this effect would have been tantamount to sentencing the new-born Christanity of Madura to death. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> understood, no doubt, that the customs connected with the distinction of castes, being so deeply rooted in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and habits of all <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>, did not admit an abrupt suppression, even among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. They were to be dealt with by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as had been slavery, serfdom, and the like institutions of past times. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> never attacked directly those inveterate customs; but she inculcated meekness, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, charity, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> who suffered and gave His life for all, and by this method slavery, serfdom, and other social abuses were slowly eradicated.

<p>While imitating this wise indulgence to the feebleness of new converts, Father de Nobili took much care to inspire his disciples with the feelings becoming <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> towards their humbler brethren. At the very outset of his preaching, he insisted on making all understand that "religion was by no means dependent on caste; indeed it must be one for all, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a> being one for all; although [he added] unity of religion destroys not the civil distinction of the castes nor the lawful privileges of the nobles". Explaining then the commandment of charity, he inculcated that it extended to the pariahs as well as others, and he exempted nobody from the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> it imposes; but he might rightly tell his <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> that, for example, visiting pariahs or other of low caste at their houses, treating them familiarly, even kneeling or sitting by them in the church, concerned perfection rather than the precept of charity, and that accordingly such actions could be omitted without any fault, at least where they involved so grave a detriment as degradation from the higher caste. Of this principle the missionaries had a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to make use for themselves. Indeed charity required more from the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> than from others; yet not in such a way that they should endanger the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the many to relieve the needs of the few. Therefore Nobili, at the beginning of his apostolate, avoided all public intercourse with the lower castes; but he failed not to minister secretly even to pariahs. In the year 1638, there were at Tiruchirapalli (Trichinopoly) several hundred <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> pariahs, who had been secretly taught and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the companions of Nobili. About this time he devised a means of assisting more directly the lower castes, without ruining the work begun among the higher.

<p>Besides the Brahmin <em>saniassy</em>, there was another grade of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> ascetics, called <em>pandaram</em>, enjoying less consideration than the Brahmins, but who were allowed to deal publicly with all castes, and even hold intercourse with the pariahs. They were not excluded from relations with the higher castes. On the advice of Nobili, the superiors of the mission with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Cranganore resolved that henceforward there should be two classes of missionaries, the Brahmin and the <em>pandaram</em>. Father Balthasar da Costa was the first, in 1540, who took the name and habit of <em>pandaram</em>, under which he effected a large number of conversions, of others as well as of pariahs. Nobili had then three <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> companions. After the comforting decision of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he had hastened to extend his preaching beyond the town of Madura, and the Gospel spread by degrees over the whole interior of South <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. In 1646, exhausted by forty-two years of toiling and suffering, he was constrained to retire, first to Jafnapatam in <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>, then to Mylapore, where he died 16 January, 1656. He left his mission in full progress. To give some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of its development, we note that the superiors, writing to the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, about the middle and during the second half of the seventeenth century, record an annual average of five thousand conversions, the number never being less than three thousand a year even when the missioners' work was most hindered by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. At the end of the seventeenth century, the total number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the mission, founded by Nobili and still named Madura mission, though embracing, besides Madura, <a href="../cathen/10661d.htm">Mysore</a>, Marava, Tanjore, Gingi, etc., is described as exceeding 150,000. Yet the number of the missionaries never went beyond seven, assisted however by many native catechists.

<p>The Madura mission belonged to the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> assistance of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, but it was supplied with men from all provinces of the Order. Thus, for example, Father Beschi (c. 1710-1746), who won so high a renown among the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, by his writings in Tamil, was an Italian, as the founder of the mission had been. In the last quarter of the seventeenth century, the French Father John Venantius Bouchet worked for twelve years in Madura, chiefly at <a href="../cathen/15040d.htm">Trichinopoly</a>, during which time he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> about 20'000 infidels. And it is to be noted that the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, in these parts of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, were admitted to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> only after a long and a careful preparation. Indeed the missionary accounts of the time bear frequent witness to the very commendable qualities of these <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, their fervent <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, their steadfastness in the sufferings they often had to endure for religion's sake, their charity towards their brethren, even of lowest castes, their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the conversion of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>. In the year 1700 Father Bouchet, with a few other <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, opened a new mission in the Karnatic, north of the River Kaveri. Like their Portuguese colleagues of Madura, the French missionaries of the Karnatic were very successful, in spite of repeated and almost continual persecutions by the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolators</a>. Moreover several of them became particularly conspicuous for the extensive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> they acquired of the literature and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> of ancient <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. From Father Coeurdoux the French Academicians learned the common origin of the Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin languages; to the initiative of Nobili and to the endeavours of his followers in the same line is due the first disclosure of a new <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> world in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. The first original documents, enabling the learned to explore that world, were drawn from their hiding-places in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and sent in large numbers to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> by the same missionaries. But the Karnatic mission had hardly begun when it was disturbed by the revival of the controversy, which the decision of <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> had set at rest for three quarters of a century.
<h2>The decree of Tournon</h2>

<p>This second phase, which was much more eventful and noisy than the first, originated in <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>. Since the French had settled at that place, the spiritual care of the colonists was in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Fathers</a>, who were also working for the conversion of the natives. With a view to forwarding the latter work, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mylapore or San Thome, to whose <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> Pondicherry belonged, resolved, in 1699, to transfer it entirely to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of the Karnatic mission, assigning to them a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> church in the town and restricting the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> immigrants, French or Portuguese. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> were displeased by this arrangement and appealed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The petition they laid before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in 1703, embodied not only a complaint against the division of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> made by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but also an accusation against the methods of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> mission in South <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. Their claim on the former point was finally dismissed, but the charges were more successful. On 6 November, 1703, Charles-Thomas Maillard de Tournon, a <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, sent by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, with the power of <em>legatus a latere</em>, to visit the new <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missions of the East Indies and especially <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, landed at <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>. Being <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to wait there eight months for the opportunity of passing over to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, Tournon instituted an inquiry into the facts alleged by the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. He was hindered through sickness, as he himself stated, from visiting any part of the inland mission; in the town, besides the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, who had not visited the interior, he interrogated a few natives through interpreters; the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> he consulted rather cursorily, it seems.

<p>Less than eight months after his arrival in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, he considered himself justified in issuing a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of vital import to the whole of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. It consisted of sixteen articles concerning practices in use or supposed to be in use among the <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> of Madura and the Karnatic; the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> condemned and prohibited these practices as defiling the purity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and religion, and forbade the missionaries, on pain of heavy censures, to permit them any more. Though <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 23 June, 1704, the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was notified to the superiors of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> only on 8 July, three days before the departure of Tournon from <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>. During the short time left, the missionaries endeavoured to make him understand on what imperfect information his degree rested, and that nothing less than the ruin of the mission was likely to follow from its execution. They succeeded in persuading him to take off orally the threat of censures appended, and to suspend provisionally the prescription commanding the missionaries to give spiritual assistance to the sick pariahs, not only in the churches, but in their dwellings.
<h2>Examination of the Malabar rites at Rome</h2>

<p>Tournon's <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, interpreted by prejudice and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> as representing, in the wrong practices if condemned, the real state of the <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> missions, affords to this day a much-used weapon against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> it was received with reserve. <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, who perhaps overrated the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, ordered, in the Congregation of the Holy Office, on 7 January, 1706, a provisional confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> to be sent to him, adding that it should be executed "until the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> might provide otherwise, after having heard those who might have something to object". And meanwhile, by an <em>oraculum vivae vocis</em> granted to the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of the Madura mission, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, "in so far as the Divine glory and the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> would permit". The objections of the missionaries and the corrections they desired were propounded by several deputies and carefully examined at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, without effect, during the lifetime of <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> and during the short pontificate of his successor <a href="../cathen/08023a.htm">Innocent XIII</a>. <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> grappled with the case and even came to a decision, enjoining "on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and missionaries of Madura, <a href="../cathen/10661d.htm">Mysore</a>, and the Karnatic" the execution of Tournon's <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> in all its parts (12 December, 1727). Yet it is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> whether that decision ever reached the mission, and <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a>, who succeeded <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, commanded the whole affair to be discussed anew. In four meetings held from 21 January to 6 September, 1733, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the Holy Office gave their final conclusions upon all the articles of Tournon's <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, declaring how each of them ought to be executed, or restricted and mitigated. By a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 24 August, 1734, <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> sanctioned this resolution; moreover, on 13 May 1739, he prescribed an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, by which every missionary should bind himself to obeying and making the <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> obey exactly the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 24 August, 1734.

<p>Many hard prescriptions of Tournon were mitigated by the regulation of 1734. As to the first article, condemning the omission of the use of saliva and breathing on the candidates for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the missionaries, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> with them, are rebuked for not having consulted the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> previously to that omission; yet, they are allowed to continue for ten years omitting these ceremonies, to which the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a> felt so strangely loath. Other prohibitions or <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> are softened by the additions of a <em>Quantum fieri potest</em>, or even replaced by mere counsels or advices. In the sixth article, the <em>taly</em>, "with the image of the idol Pulleyar", is still <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdicted</a>, but the Congregation observes that "the missionaries say they never permitted wearing of such a <em>taly</em>". Now this observation seems pretty near to recognizing that possibly the prohibitions of the rather overzealous <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> did not always hit upon existing abuses. And a similar conclusion might be drawn from several other articles, e.g. from the fifteenth, where we are told that the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdiction</a> of wearing ashes and emblems after the manner of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>, ought to be kept, but in such a manner, it is added, "that the Constitution of <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> of 31 January, 1623, 'Romanae Senis Antistes', be observed throughout". By that Constitution, as we have already seen, some signs and ornaments, materially similar to those prohibited by Tournon, were allowed to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, provided that no <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> whatever was mingled with their use. Indeed, as the Congragation of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> explains in an Instruction sent to the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>, 15 February, 1792, "the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of Cardinal de Tournon and the Constitution of <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> agree in this way, that both absolutely forbid any sign bearing even the least semblance of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, but allow those which are in general use for the sake of adornment, of good manners, and bodily cleanness, without any respect to religion".

<p>The most difficult point retained was the twelfth article, commanding the missionaries to administer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to the sick pariahs in their dwellings, publicly. Though submitting <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">dutifully</a> to all <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the Vicar of Christ, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in Madura could not but feel distressed, at experiencing how the last especially, made their apostolate difficult and even impossible amidst the upper classes of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>. At their request, <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> consented to try a new solution of the knotty problem, by forming a band of missionaries who should attend only to the care of the pariahs. This scheme became formal law through the Constitution "Omnium sollicitudinum", published 12 September, 1744. Except this point, the document confirmed again the whole regulation enacted by <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> in 1734. The arrangement sanctioned by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> benefited greatly the lower classes of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a>; whether it worked also to the advantage of the mission at large, is another question, about which the reports are less comforting. Be that as it may, after the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society of Jesus</a> (1773), the distinction between Brahmin and pariah missionaries became extinct with the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries. Henceforth conversions in the higher castes were fewer and fewer, and nowadays the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>, for the most part, belong to the lower and lowest classes. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries, when reentering Madura in the 1838, did not come with the dress of the Brahmin <em>saniassy</em>, like the founders of the mission; yet they pursued a design which Nobili had also in view, though he could not carry it out, as they opened their college of Negapatam, now at <a href="../cathen/15040d.htm">Trichinopoly</a>. A wide breach has already been made into the wall of <a href="../cathen/02730a.htm">Brahminic</a> reserve by that institution, where hundreds of Brahmins send their sons to be taught by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries. Within recent years, about fifty of these young men have embraced the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of their teachers, at the cost of rejection from their caste and even from their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; such examples are not lost on their countrymen, either of high or low caste.
