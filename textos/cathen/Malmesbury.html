<h1>Malmesbury</h1>  

<p>A small decayed market town in Wiltshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, ninety-five miles west of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, formerly the seat of a mitred parliamentary abbey of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. It owed its origin to Maildubh or Maildulf, an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and teacher who settled in the place about the middle of the seventh century, Bladon as the British, Inglebourn as the English called it, was then a border settlement between the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> and English, and on the confines of the kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia. It was strongly placed on a high bluff almost surrounded by two small rivers, and an ancient stronghold or castle still further defended it. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which Maildubh opened attracted many pupils, and chief amongst them &AElig;ldhelm or Aldhelm, son of Kenten, and a near relation of King Ina of Wessex. Aldhelm was sent twice to Canterbury to study under St. Adrian the African, then <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of SS. Peter and Paul (afterwards St. Augustine's). Returning to Malmesbury between 671 and 675, he was placed in charge of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and appointed <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> founded there by Lothair (Leutherius), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dorchester. Under his rule the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> greatly prospered. On the division of the Wessex Diocese, Aldhelm was made first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sherborne, in Dorset, while Daniel, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Malmesbury, became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>. The former retained the management of Malmesbury and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Frome and Bradford-on-Avon, which he had founded. The house suffered under <a href="../cathen/05324a.htm">Edwy</a>, who in 958 expelled the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; sixteen years later they were restored by King Edgar (974). Edward the Confessor sanctioned a proposal of Bishop Herman of Wilton to transfer his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to Malmesbury; the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and Earl Godwin opposed this, and Old Sarum was chosen instead. Like King Athelstan and other Saxon monarchs, so did William the Conqueror, John, Richard II, Henry IV, and Henry V befriend the house in later times.

<p>Under John the place was attacked by Robert, a marauding soldier who had gained possession of Devizes Castle; he slew all the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who failed to escape (1140). John bestowed on the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> the site of Malmesbury Castle, which he pulled down to enlarge their enclosure, which covered forty-five acres. The town of Malmesbury was walled and had four gates, all now vanished. A preceptory of <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">Knights of St. John of Jerusalem</a>, three churches, and one or two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunneries</a>, a mint, an important merchant's guild, and a large population marked the prosperity of the place. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church was a vast and noble building with a western tower, and a central tower and spire seven yards higher than that of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a>. Besides the above-named, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was connected with other celebrated men: Pecthelm, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Whithorn (Galloway); <a href="../cathen/05555a.htm">Ethelhard</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>; &AElig;lfric, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Crediton; John <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> Erigena; Faricius of <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a>, physician and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, later <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Abingdon; Oliver or Elmer, mechanician, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, and aeronaut; an anonymous Greek <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> who planted vineyards here; Godfrey, and one or two anonymous writers; and most famous of all, William Somerset, known as <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a> (died about 1143), who ranks after <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> as the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> historians. Of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> who ruled the house and its dependency, Pilton Priory, Devonshire, in the last four hundred years of its existence, few attained any special celebrity. On the whole they seem to have been good administrators and great builders. One or two came under censure from the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> general chapters for their negligence in sending the due proportion of their junior <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which had an annual revenue of &pound;803, was surrendered in 1539 by its last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Robert Selwyn, or Frampton, and twenty-one of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, who received pensions. Of the whole <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> only five bays of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> are standing; the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a>, etc., which were to the north of the church, have entirely disappeared.
