<h1>Malvern</h1>  

<p>Located in Worcestershire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, a district covered by a lofty range between the Severn and Wye, known as the Malvern Hills. On its eastern side were formerly two houses of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> of Great and Little Malvern.
<h2 id="section1">Great Malvern</h2>

<p>Great Malvern began soon after the death of St. Werstan, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Deerhurst, who, flying from the Danes and taking refuge in the woods of Malvern, was there slain, and afterwards <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a saint. A hermitage was established there before the Norman Conquest; one Aldwyn, who had been made a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> by St. Wulstan, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that see, and a companion called Guy, were apparently the first to settle here. Aldwyn, by St. Wulstan's advice, gave up his contemplated <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Jerusalem and began a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Malvern, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> promising him that the place would be wonderfully favoured by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of thirty <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> gathered there under Aldwyn's direction (1135); the usual number was twenty-six (and thirty poor men), and four at the dependent cell, Avecot Priory, Warwickshire, established by William Burdet in 1159. Aldwyn was succeeded by Walcher, a Lorrainer, a man celebrated as an <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, divine, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. He was probably one of those sent by Abbot Gilbert of Westminster to establish a regular community at Malvern on land previously given for the purpose by Urso D'Abitot and Edward the Confessor. William the Conqueror confirmed these grants and was himself a benefactor, as also was Henry I. This connexion with Westminster led later on to a famous and protracted conflict between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Westminster. For a long time the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> right of visitation over Great Malvern had been unquestioned; on the election however of a prior John in 1242, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> opposed the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> action in confirming and installing the new superior. Under his successor, William de Ledbury, matters came to a head. Ledbury was accused of serious crimes by some of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and was promptly deposed by <a href="../cathen/06551b.htm">Bishop Godfrey Giffard</a>. On this the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> chose instead the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> nephew, William de Wykewan, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Avecot. Wykewan proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Westminster was then on a visit, for confirmation in his new office. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> arrested him and his followers and sent them in chains to Westminster. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> retaliated by suspending and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> Ledbury and his adherents, and the whole countryside was made to feel the inconveniences of a disputed <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Westminster claimed exemption by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> grant for itself and all its dependencies, and in this was supported by the king; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was supported by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and to some extent by other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p>An appeal to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> led to fuller enquiry, and for some time things went as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> wished; but his harsh dealing with the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> went so far that they, the unfortunate victims of all this litigation, were taken under the king's protection. Finally an end was put to a long and intricate process, wherein all powers and parties in <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> were involved, by a truce agreed to at Acton Burnell. Ledbury was reinstated and then deposed by his <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>; the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> gave the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the manor of Knightwick, and he on his part released them absolutely from his own <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, "in accordance with privileges heretofore granted by divers <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiffs</a>". The episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was retained only over their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches. Peace was arrived at, and all was amicably settled in 1314, when Bishop Walter Maydeston gave the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> the church of Powyke to reimburse them for all their losses, and confirmed the grant to them of that of Langley, for the maintenance of the great charity shown by them to the poor and <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. A long period of prosperity followed. The church was magnificently rebuilt (c. 1460); it is cruciform with a central tower &mdash; Sir Reginald Bray, designer of Henry VII's <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, is believed to have been the architect. It is 171 feet long, 63 wide and high. Its <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained glass</a> is famous, as are its ancient tiles, made at the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>. Both are memorials of many royal and noble benefactors. The church, St. Mary's, was purchased by Richard Berdes and others at the dissolution, and the old <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church (St. Thomas the Apostle) has now disappeared. The <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> rental was &pound;308 (Dugdale) or &pound;375 (Speed). Latimer pleaded in vain for the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> as a refuge for learned and studious men.
<h2 id="section2">Little Malvern Priory</h2>

<p>Little Malvern (Our Lady and St. Giles), three miles south of the former, was a small <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> founded from <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> about 1171. The choir and tower of its church alone remain; portions of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> are incorporated in The Court, an old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mansion, the seat of the <a href="../cathen/02491a.htm">Beringtons</a>.
