<h1>Manasses</h1>  

<p>The name of seven <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15039a.htm">tribe of Israel</a>, and one of the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal writings</a>.
<h2>The individuals</h2>

<p>(1) M<font size=-2>ANASSES</font> (Heb. ***; <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> <em>Manass&#234;</em>), eldest son of Joseph and the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/01774c.htm">Aseneth</a> (<a href="../bible/gen041.htm#vrs50">Genesis 41:50-51</a>; <a href="../bible/gen046.htm#vrs20">46:20</a>). The name means "he that causes to forget"; Joseph assigned the reason for its bestowal: "God hath made me to forget all my toils, and my father's house" (<a href="../bible/gen041.htm#vrs51">Genesis 41:51</a>). Jacob blessed Manasses (<a href="../bible/gen048.htm">Genesis 48</a>); but gave preference to the younger son Ephraim, despite the father's protestations in favour of Manasses. By this blessing, Jacob put Manasses and Ephraim in the same class with <a href="../cathen/13214b.htm">Ruben</a> and Simeon (verses 3-5), and gave foundation for the admission of the tribes of Manasses and Ephraim.

<p>(2) M<font size=-2>ANASSES</font>, Judith's husband, died of sunstroke in <a href="../cathen/02537b.htm">Bethulia</a> (<a href="../bible/jth008.htm#vrs2">Judith 8:2-3</a>).

<p>(3) M<font size=-2>ANASSES,</font> a character in the story of Ahikar (not in Vulg., but in Sept.) told by Tobias on the point of death. The Vatican <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> mentions Manasses (<em>Manass&#234;s</em>) as one "who gave <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> and escaped the snare of death"; the Sinaitic <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> mentions no one, but clearly refers the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a> and escape to <a href="../cathen/01102b.htm">Achiacharus</a>. The reading of the Vatican <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> is probably an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> ("Rev. Bibl.", Jan. 1899).

<p>(4) M<font size=-2>ANASSES,</font> son of Bani, one of the companions of <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a> who married foreign wives (<a href="../bible/ezr010.htm#vrs30">Ezra 10:30</a>).

<p>(5) M<font size=-2>ANASSES,</font> son of Hasom, another of the same companions of <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a> (<a href="../bible/ezr010.htm#vrs33">Ezra 10:33</a>).

<p>(6) M<font size=-2>ANASSES</font> (according to k&rsquo;thibh of <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic Text</a> and Sept.), ancestor of Jonathan, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the tribe of <a href="../cathen/04615c.htm">Dan</a> (<a href="../bible/jdg018.htm#vrs30">Judges 18:30</a>). The <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> and k&rsquo;ri of the <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic Text</a> give Moses, the correct reading.

<p>(7) M<font size=-2>ANASSES,</font> thirteenth King of Juda (692-638 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> &mdash; cf. Schrader, "Keilinschr. und das A. T."), son and successor to Ezechias (<a href="../bible/2ki020.htm#vrs21">2 Kings 20:21 sq.</a>). The historian of <a href="../bible/2ki000.htm">2 Kings</a> tells us much about the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of his reign (xxi, 2-10), and the punishment thereof foretold by the Prophets (verses 10- 15), but practically nothing about the rest of the doings of Manasses. He brought back the abominations of Achaz; imported the adoration of "all the host of heaven", seemingly the astral, solar, and lunar myths of <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>; introduced the other enormities mentioned in the Sacred text; and "made his son pass through fire" (verse 6) in the worship of <a href="../cathen/10443b.htm">Moloch</a>. It was probably in this frenzy of his varied forms of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> that "Manasses shed also very much innocent blood, till he filled <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> up to the mouth" (verse 16). The historian of II Par. tells much the same story, and adds that, in punishment, the Lord brought the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> upon Juda. They carried Manasses to Babylon. The Lord heard his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for forgiveness and deliverance, and brought him again to Jerusalem, where Manasses did his part in stemming the tide of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> that he had formerly forced upon Juda (xxxiii, 11-20). At one time, <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> was cast on the historicity of this narrative of <a href="../bible/2ch001.htm">II Paralipomenon</a>, because <a href="../bible/2ki000.htm">2 Kings</a> omits the captivity of Manasses. Schrader (op. cit., 2nd ed., Giessen, 1883, 355) gives cuneiform records of twenty- two kings that submitted to Assurhaddon during his expedition against <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; second on the list is Mi-na-si-i sar ir Ya-u-di (Manasses, king of the city of Juda). Schrader also gives the list of twenty-two kings who are recorded on a cuneiform tablet as tributaries to Asurbanipal in the land of Hatti; second on this list is Mi-in-si-i sar mat Ya-u-di (Manasses, king of the land of Juda). Since a <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> brick confirms the record of the historian of <a href="../bible/2ch001.htm">II Paralipomenon</a>, his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> is made a little more secure in <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> circles. Winckler and Zimmern admit the presence of Manasses in Babylon (see their revision of Schrader's "Keilinschr. und das A. T.", I, <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1902, 274). Conjectures of the Pan-Babylonian School as to the causes that led to the return of Manasses, the groundwork of the narrative in <a href="../bible/2ki000.htm">2 Kings</a>, etc., do not militate against the historical worth of the Inspired Record.
<h2>The tribe</h2>

<p>Deriving its name from Manasses, son of Joseph, this tribe was divided into two half-tribes &mdash; the eastern and the western. The tribe east of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> was represented by the descendants of Machir (<a href="../bible/jdg005.htm#vrs14">Judges 5:14</a>). Machir was the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of Manasses (<a href="../bible/jos017.htm#vrs1">Joshua 17:1</a>). The children of Machir took Galaad (<a href="../bible/num032.htm#vrs39">Numbers 32:39</a>); Moses gave the land of Galaad to Machir (verse 40). Two other sons of Manasses, Jair and Nobe, also took villages in Galaad, and gave thereto their own names (verses 41-42). The territory of the western half-tribe is roughly sketched in <a href="../bible/jos016.htm#vrs1">Joshua 16:1-3</a>. It was that part of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> which lay between the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> and the Mediterranean, the plain of Esdrelon and the towns of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, Sichem, and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>. The eastern half-tribe occupied north Galaad, all Basan, and Argob (<a href="../bible/jos013.htm#vrs30">Joshua 13:30-31</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/deu003.htm#vrs13">Deuteronomy 3:13</a>) &mdash; an immense tract of land extending east of Jordan to the present Mecca route (<em>darb el-haj</em>) and far beyond, so as to include the Hauran.
<h2>The writing</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> of Manasses is an <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> writing which purports to give the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> referred to in <a href="../bible/2ch033.htm#vrs13">2 Chronicles 33:13, 18-19</a>. Its original is Greek. Nestle thinks that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and other legends of Manasses in their present form are not earlier than the "Apost. Const.", xi, 22; and that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> found its way into some <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> as part, not of the Sept., but of the "Apost. Const." (see "Septuaginta Studien", III, 1889). The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not in the canon of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, nor has there ever seemed to have been any serious claim to its canonicity.
