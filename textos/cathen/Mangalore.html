<h1>Mangalore</h1>  

<p>(M<font size=-2>ANGALORENSIS</font>)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> on the west coast of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>. It comprises the whole collectorate of South Canara, and a portion of <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a> from Ponany to Mount Deli; it stretches inland as far as the Ghauts, a distance varying from 40 to 60 miles. The total <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is reckoned at about 93, 028. South Canara is divided into four <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> districts, each with its Vara (almost equivalent to rural dean), in which there are thirty-three churches with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> besides a number of <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, while in Malabar there are churches at Cannanore, Tellicherry and Calicut. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are partly of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> province of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and partly native <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, the former numbering 41 and the latter 56. There is also a house of the Convent of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Congregation, Syro-Malabar rite, besides <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Tertiaries and Sisters of Charity. The episcopal residence and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> are at Mangalore.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>Originally the South Canara portion belonged to the <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Archdiocese of Goa</a>, while the Malabar portion belonged to the Archbishopric of Cranganore. <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> was at Cannanore for a few hours, but there is no evidence for the popular tradition that he missionised Canara. The pioneer work seems to have been done by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who early in the sixteenth century had founded several stations along the coast; and the member of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was augmented by immigrations from Salcete near <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>. In the seventeenth century, on account of the decline of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> supremacy in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, Canara seems to have become destitute of resident <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In consequence the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> placed the country under the already existing <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of Malabar &mdash; an arrangement which soon gave rise to rivalry and disputes with the <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> authorities. Between 1685 and 1712 some <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> were working in the districts, of whom the chief was the Ven. Joseph Vas. In 1764 Canara fell under the dominion of Hyder Ali of <a href="../cathen/10661d.htm">Mysore</a>, whose attitude towards the Christrians was favourable. But his successor Tipu Sultan (1782-1799) showed himself so fanatical and violent that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were for the most part seized and reduced to captivity. A few were suffered to remain unmolested round about Mangalore, while others escaped to Coorg and certain parts of the Carnatic. Meanwhile the country still remained under the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/15345a.htm">Verapoly</a> (Malabar) whose domain comprised not only South but also North Canara (Sunkery or Carwar mission) while Coorg fell to the lot of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of the Great Mugul at <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>. In 1838, in consequence of the brief "Multa Praeclare", and its definitive restriction of the Padroado <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, great rivalry and discord was renewed between the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> and Padroado parties. In 1840 the people of Canara hoped to put an end to these dissentions by petitioning for a separate vicariate; but the movement was opposed by the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. In 1845 the Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/15345a.htm">Verapoly</a> was divided into three parts (Quilon, <a href="../cathen/15345a.htm">Verapoly</a> and Mangalore) and the pro-vicar Apostolic appointed for Mangalore was a <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, Father Bernardine of St. Agnes. In 1853 South Canara was made into a separate vicariate but remained under <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> rule until 1858, when it was transferred to the French <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, and finally in 1878 to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. On the formation of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in 1886 Mangalore became a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, which in 1893, together with Trichinopoly, was made suffragan to Bombay.
