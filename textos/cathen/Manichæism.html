<h1>Manich&aelig;ism</h1>  

<p>Manich&aelig;ism is a religion founded by the Persian Mani in the latter half of the third century. It purported to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> synthesis of all the religious systems then known, and actually consisted of <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrian</a> <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a>, <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> folklore, <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> ethics, and some small and superficial, additions of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> elements. As the theory of two eternal principles, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is predominant in this fusion of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and gives color to the whole, Manich&aelig;ism is classified as a form of religious <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a>. It spread with extraordinary rapidity in both East and West and maintained a sporadic and intermittent existence in the West (Africa, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, North <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the Balkans) for a thousand years, but it flourished mainly in the land of its birth, (Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, Turkestan) and even further East in Northern <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, Western <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, and Tibet, where, c. A.D. 1000, the bulk of the population professed its tenets and where it died out at an uncertain date.
<h2 id="section1">Life of the founder</h2>

<p>Mani (Gr. <em>Manys</em>, gen. usually <em>Manytos</em>, sometimes <em>Manentos</em>, rarely <em>Manou</em>; or <em>Manichios</em>; <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>Manes</em>, gen. <em>Manetis</em>; In Augustine always <em>Manichaeus</em>) is a title and term of respect rather than a personal name. Its exact meaning is not quite certain, ancient Greek interpretations were <em>skeuos</em> and <em>homilia</em>, but its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> derivation is probably from the Babylonian-Aramaic <em>M&acirc;n&acirc;</em>, which, among the <a href="../cathen/10705a.htm">Mandaeans</a> was a term for a light-spirit, <em>m&acirc;n&acirc; rabba</em> being the "Light King". It would therefore mean "the illustrious". This title was assumed by the founder himself and so completely replaced his personal name that the precise form of the latter is not known; two latinized forms, however, are handed down, Cubricus and Ubricus, and it seems likely that these forms are a corruption of the not unusual name of Shuraik. Although Mani's personal name is thus subject to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerning that of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. His father's name was F&acirc;t&acirc;k B&acirc;b&acirc;k (<em>Ratekios</em>, or the "well preserved"), a citizen of Ecbatana, the ancient Median capital and a member of the famous Chascanian Gens. The boy was born A.D. 215-216 in the village of Mardinu in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, from a mother of noble (<a href="../cathen/01753f.htm">Arsacide</a>) descent whose name variously is given as Mes, Ut&acirc;ch&icirc;m, Marmarjam, and Karossa. The father was evidently a man of strong religious propensities, since he left Ecbatana to join the South <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a> (Menakkede) or <a href="../cathen/10705a.htm">Mandaeans</a> and had his son <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in their tenets. Mani's father himself must have displayed considerable activities as a religious reformer and have been a kind of forerunner of his more famous son, in the first years of whose public life he had some share. It is not impossible that some of Patekios' writing lies imbedded in the <a href="../cathen/10705a.htm">Mandaean</a> literature which has come down to us. Through misunderstandings the Aramaic word for disciple (<em>Tarbitha</em>, stat abs. <em>Tarbi</em>), Greek and Latin sources speak of a certain <em>Terebinthos</em>, Terebinthus of Turbo, as a distinct <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, whom they confound partially with Mani, partially with Patekios, and as they also forgot that Mani, besides being Patekios' great disciple, was his bodily son, and that in consequence the Scythian teacher, Scythianus, is but Fatak Babak of Hamadam, the Scythian <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>, their account of the first origins of Manich&aelig;ism differs considerably from that given in Oriental sources. Notwithstanding Kessler's ingenious researches in this field, we cannot say that the relation between Oriental and Western sources on this point has been sufficiently cleared up, and it may well be that the Western tradition going back through the "Acta Archelai" to within a century of Mani's death, contains some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p>Mani's father was at first apparently an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolater</a>, for, as he worshipped in a temple to his gods he is supposed to have heard a voice urging him to abstain from meat, wine, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. In obedience to this voice he <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to the south and joined the Mughtasilah, or <a href="../cathen/10705a.htm">Mandaean</a> <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a>, taking the boy Mani, with him, but possibly leaving Mani's mother behind. Here, at the age of twelve Mani is supposed to have received his first revelation. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Eltaum (God of the Covenant; Tamiel of Jewish Rabbinical lore?), appeared to him, bade him leave the <a href="../cathen/10705a.htm">Mandaeans</a>, and live chastely, but to wait still some twelve years before proclaiming himself to the people. It is not unlikely that the boy was trained up to the profession of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, as he is often thus designated in Oriental (though late) sources.

<p>Babylon was still a center of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; here Mani became thoroughly imbued with their ancient speculations. On Sunday, 20 March, A.D. 242, Mani first proclaimed his gospel in the royal residence, Gundesapor, on the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> day of Sapor I, when vast crowds from all parts were gathered together. "As once Buddha came to India, Zoroaster to Persia, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to the lands of the West, so came in the present time, this prophecy through me, the Mani, to the land of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>", sounded the proclamation of this "Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God". He seems to have had but little immediate success and was compelled to leave the country. For many years he traveled abroad, founding Manich&aelig;an communities in <a href="../cathen/15095a.htm">Turkestan</a> and <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. When he finally returned to <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> he succeeded in converting to his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> Peroz, the brother of Sapor I, and dedicated to him one of his most important works, the "Shapurikan". Peroz obtained for Mani an audience with the king and Mani delivered his prophetical message in the royal presence. We soon find Mani again a fugitive from his native land; though here and there, as in Beth Garmia, his teaching seems to have taken early root. While traveling, Mani spread and strengthened his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> by epistles, or encyclical letters, of which some four score are known to us by title. It is said that Mani afterwards fell into the hands of Sapor I, was cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and only released at the king's death in 274. It seems certain that Sapor's successor, Ormuzd I, was favorable to the new <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; perhaps he even personally released him from his dungeon, unless, indeed, Mani had already effected his escape by bribing a warder and fleeing across the Roman frontier. <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ormuzd's</a> favor, however, was of little avail, as he occupied the Persian throne only a single year, and Bahram I, his successor, soon after his accession, caused Mani to be crucified, had the corpse flayed, the skin stuffed and hung up at the city gate, as a terrifying spectacle to his followers, whom he <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> with relentless severity. The <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death is fixed at 276-277.


<h2 id="section2">System of doctrine and discipline</h2>
<h3>Doctrine</h3>

<p>The key to Mani's system is his <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogony</a>. Once this is known there is little else to learn. In this sense Mani was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a>, as he brought <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Manich&aelig;ism professed to be a religion of pure reason as opposed to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> credulity; it professed to explain the origin, the composition, and the future of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; it had an answer for everything and despised <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, which was full of mysteries. It was utterly unconscious that its every answer was a mystification or a whimsical invention; in fact, it gained mastery over men's minds by the astonishing completeness, minuteness, and consistency of its assertions.

<p>We are giving the <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogony</a> as contained in Theodore Bar Khoni, embodying the results of the study of Fran&ccedil;ois Cumont. Before the existence of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth and all that is therein, there were two Principles, the one Good the other Bad. The Good Principle dwells in the realm of light and is called the Father of Majesty (Grandeur or Greatness, <em>Megethos</em>, Abba D'rabbutha), or the Father with the Four Faces or Persons (<em>tetraprosopon</em>), probably because Time, Light, Force, and Goodness were regarded as essential manifestations of the First Being by the Zervanites (see <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">Cosmogony</a>: <em>Iranian</em>). Outside the Father there are his Five Tabernacles or <em>Shechinatha</em>, Intelligence, Reason, Thought, Reflection, and Will. The designation of "Tabernacle" contains a play on the sound <em>Shechina</em> which means both dwelling or tent and "Divine glory or presence" and is used in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> to designate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> presence between the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">Cherubim</a>. These five tabernacles were pictured on the one hand as stories of one building &#151; Will being the topmost story &#151; and on the other hand as limbs of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> body. He indwelt and possessed them all, so as to be, in a sense, identical with them, yet again, in a sense, to be distinct from them. They are also designated as <em>aeons</em> or worlds, <em>beata secula</em>, in St. Augustine's writings. In other sources the five limbs are: Longanimity, Knowledge, Reason, Discretion, and Understanding. And again these five as limbs of the Father's spiritual body were sometimes distinguished from the five attributes of His pure Intelligence: Love, Faith, Truth, Highmindedness, and Wisdom. This Father of light together with the light-air and the light-earth, the former with five attributes parallel to his own, and the latter with the five limbs of Breath, Wind, Light, Water, and Fire constitute the Manich&aelig;an pleroma. This light world is of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> extent in five directions and has only one limit, set to it below by the realm of Darkness, which is likewise <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> in all directions barring the one above, where it borders on the realm of light. Opposed to the Father of Grandeur is the King of Darkness. He is actually never called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but otherwise, he and his kingdom down below are exactly parallel to the ruler and realm of the light above. The dark Pleroma is also triple, as it were <a href="../cathen/06079b.htm">firmament</a>, air, and earth inverted. The first two (Heshuha and Humana) have the five attributes, members, <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">aeons</a>, or worlds: Pestilent Breath, Scorching Wind, Gloom, Mist, Consuming Fire; the last has the following five: Wells of Poison, Columns of Smoke, Abysmal Depths, Fetid Marshes, and Pillars of Fire. This last five fold division is clearly borrowed from ancient Chaldean <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> current in Mesopotamia.

<p>These two powers might have lived <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> in peace, had not the Prince of Darkness decided to invade the realm of light. On the approach of the monarch of chaos the five <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">aeons</a> of light were seized with terror. This incarnation of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> called <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> or Ur-devil (<em>Diabolos protos, Iblis Kadim</em>, in Arabic sources), a monster half fish, half bird, yet with four feet and lion-headed, threw himself upward toward the confines of light. The echo of the thunder of his onrush went through the blessed <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">aeons</a> until it reached the Father of Majesty, who bethinking himself said: I will not send my five <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">aeons</a>, made for blessed repose, to engage in this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, I will go myself and give battle. Hereupon the Father of Majesty emanated the Mother of Life and the Mother of Life emanated the first man. These two constitute, with the Father, a sort of Trinity in Unity, hence the Father could say: "I myself will go". Mani here assimilates <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> already known from <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a> (q.v., subtitle <em>The Sophia Myth</em>) and resembling <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>, especially when it is borne in mind that "Spirit" is feminine in <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew-Aramaic</a> and thus could easily be conceived as a mother of all living. The Protanthropos or "First Man" is a distinctly Irani an conception, which likewise found its way into a number of <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> systems, but which became the central figure in Manich&aelig;ism. The myth of the origin of the world out of the members of a dead giant or Ur-man is extremely ancient, not only in Iranian speculations but also in Indian mythology (Rig-Veda, X, 90), Indeed if the myth of giant Ymir in Norse <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">Cosmogonies</a> is not merely a <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> invention, as is sometimes asserted, this legend must be one of the earliest possessions of the Aryan race.

<p>According to Mani the First-Man now emanates sons as a man who puts on his armor for the combat. These five sons are the five elements opposed to the five <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">aeons</a> of darkness: Clear Air, Refreshing Wind, Bright Light, Life-Giving Waters, and Warming Fire. He put on first the aerial breeze, then threw over himself light as a flaming mantle, and over this light a covering of water; he surrounded himself with gusts of wind, took light as his lance and shield, and cast himself downward toward the line of danger. An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> called Nahashbat (?), carrying a crown of victory, went before him. The First-Man projected his light before him, and the King of Darkness seeing it, thought and said: "What I have sought from afar, lo, I have found it near me." He also clothed himself with his five elements, and engaged in combat with the First-Man. The struggle went in favor of the King of Darkness. The First-Man when being overcome, gave himself and his five sons as food to the five sons of Darkness, "as a man having an enemy, mixes deadly poison in a cake, and gives it to his foe." When these five resplendent <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> had been absorbed by the sons of Darkness, reason was taken away from them and they became through the poisonous admixture with the sons of Darkness, like unto a man bitten by a wild dog or serpent. Thus the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one conquered for a while. But the First-Man recovered his reason and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> seven times to the Father of Majesty, who being moved by mercy, emanated as second creation, the Friend of the Light, this Friend of the Light emanated the Great Ban, and the Great Ban emanated the Spirit of Life. Thus a second trinity parallel to the first (Father of Light, Mother of Light, First-Man) comes into existence. The first two personages of the latter trinity have not yet been explained and particularly the meaning of the Great Ban is a puzzle, but as in the former trinity, it is the third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, who does the actual work, the Spirit of Life (<em>To Zon Pneuma</em>), who becomes the <a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">demi-urge</a> or world former. Like the First-Man he emanates five personalities: from his intelligence the Ornament of Splendour (Sefath Ziva, Splenditenens, <em>phegotatochos</em> in Greek and Latin sources), from his reason the Great King of Honour, from his thought Adamas, Light, from his self reflection the King of Glory, and from his will the Supporter (Sabhla, Atlas and <em>Omothoros</em> of Greek and Latin sources). These five <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> were objects of special worship amongst Manich&aelig;ans, and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (<a href="../fathers/140615.htm"><em>Reply to Faustus</em> XV</a>) gives us descriptions of them drawn from Manich&aelig;an <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>.

<p>These five descend to the realm of Darkness, find the First-Man in his degradation and rescue him by the word of their power; his armour remains behind, by lifting him by the right hand the Spirit of Life brings him back to the Mother of Life. The fashioning of the world now begins. Some of the sons of the Spirit of Life kill and flay the archons or sons of Darkness and bring them to the Mother of Life. She spreads out their skins and forms twelve heavens. Their corpses are hurled on the realm of Darkness and eight worlds are made, their bones form the mountain ranges. The Ornament of splendour holds the five resplendent <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> by their waist and below their waist the heavens are extended. Atlas carries all on his shoulders, the Great King of Honour sits on top of the heavens and guards over all. The Spirit of Life forces the sons of Darkness to surrender some of the light which they had absorbed from the five elements and out of this he forms the sun and the moon (vessels of light, <em>lucidae <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a></em> in St. Augustine) and the stars. The Spirit of Life further makes the wheels of the wind under the earth near the Supporter. The King of Glory by some creation or other enables these wheels to mount the surface of the earth and thus prevents the five resplendent <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> from being set on fire by the poison of the archons. The text of Theodore bar Khoni is here so confused and corrupt that it is difficult to catch the meaning; probably wind, water, air, and fire are considered protective coverings, encircling and enveloping the gross material earth and revolving around it.

<p>At this stage of the <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogony</a> the Mother of Life, the First-Man, and the Spirit of Life beg and beseech the Father of Majesty for a further creation and for a third creation he emanated the Messenger; in Latin sources this is the so-called Legatus Tertius. This Messenger emanates twelve virgins with their garments, crowns, and garlands, namely, Royalty, Wisdom, Victory, Persuasion, Purity, Truth, Faith, Patience, Righteousness, Goodness, Justice, and Light. The Messenger dwells in the sun and, coming toward these twelve virgin-vessels he commands his three attendants to make them revolve and soon they reach the height of the heavens. All this is a transparent metaphor for the planetary system and the signs of the zodiac. No sooner do the heavens rotate than the Messenger commands the Great Ban to renovate the earth and make the Great Wheels (Air, Fire, and Water) to mount. The great <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> now moves but as yet there is no life of plants, beasts, or man. The production of vegetation, animal, and rational life on earth is a process of obscenity, cannibalism, abortion, and prize-fighting between the Messenger and the sons and daughters of Darkness, the details of which are better passed over. Finally, Naimrael, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a>, and Ashaklun, a male devil, bring forth two children, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a>. In Adam's body were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> a vast number of germs of light. He was the great captive of the Power of Evil. The Powers of Light had pity and sent a Savior, the luminous <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. This <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> approached innocent Adam, awoke him from his sleep of death, made him move, drew him out of his slumber, drove away the seductive demon, and enchained far away from him the mighty <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> archon. Adam reflected on himself and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he existed. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> then instructed Adam and showed him the Father's dwelling in the celestial heights, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> showed him his own <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, exposed to all things, to the teeth of the panther, the teeth of the elephant, devoured by the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greedy</a>, swallowed by <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttons</a>, eaten by dogs, mixed with and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in all that exists, encompassed by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> odours of Darkness. Mani's weird but mighty <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> had thus created a "suffering Savior" and given him the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">name of Jesus</a>. But this Saviour is but the personification of the Cosmic Light as far as <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in matter, therefore it is diffused throughout all nature, it is born, suffers, and dies every day, it is crucified on every tree, it is daily eaten in all food. This captive Cosmic Light is called <em>Jesus patibilis.</em> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> then made Adam stand up and taste of the tree of life. Adam then looked around and wept. He mightily lifted up his voice as a roaring lion. He tore his hair and struck his breast and said, "Cursed be the creator of my body and he who bound my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and they who have made me their slave." Man's <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> henceforth is to keep his body pure from all bodily stain by practicing self-denial and to help also in the great work of purification throughout the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Manich&aelig;an <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">eschatology</a> is in keeping with its <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogony</a>. When, mainly through the activity of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, all light particles have been gathered together, the messenger, or Legatus Tertius appears, the Spirit of Life comes from the west, the First Man with his hosts comes from north, south, and east, together with all light <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">aeons</a>, and all perfect Manich&aelig;ans. Atlas, the World Supporter throws his burden away, the Ornament of Splendour above lets go, and thus <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and earth sink into the abyss. A universal conflagration ensues and burns on till nothing but lightless cinders remain. This fire continues during 1486 years, during which the torments of the wicked are the delights of the just. When the separation of light from darkness is finally completed, all <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of light who had functions in the creation return on high; the dark world-soul sinks away in the depth, which is then closed forever and eternal tranquillity reigns in the realm of light, no more to be invaded by darkness. With regard to the after-death of the individual, Manich&aelig;ism taught a threefold state prepared for the Perfect, the Hearers, and the Sinners (non-Manich&aelig;ans). The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the first are after death received by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, who is sent by the First-Man accompanied by three <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">aeons</a> of light and the Light Maiden. They give the deceased a water vessel, a garment, a turban, a crown, and a wreath of light. In vain do <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil angels</a> lie in his path, he scorns them and on the ladder of praise he mounts first to the moon, then to the First-Man, the Sun, the Mother of Life, and finally the Supreme Light. The bodies of the perfect are purified by sun, moon, and stars; their light-particles, set free, mount to the First-Man and are formed into minor <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a>, surrounding his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. The fate of the Heavens is ultimately the same as that of the Perfect, but they have to pass through a long <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> before they arrive at <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal bliss</a>. Sinners, however, must, after death wander about in torment and anguish, surrounded by demons, and condemned by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, till the end of the world, when they are, body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, thrown into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.
<h3>Discipline</h3>

<p>To set the light-substance free from the pollution of matter was the ultimate aim of all Manich&aelig;an life. Those who entirely devoted themselves to this work were the "Elect" or the "Perfect", the <em>Primates Manichaeorum</em>; those who through human frailty felt unable to abstain from all earthly joys, though they accepted Manich&aelig;an tenets, were "the Hearers", <em>auditores</em>, or <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>. The former bear a striking similarity to <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, only with this difference that they were always itinerant, being forbidden to settle anywhere permanently. The life of these ascetics was a hard one. They were forbidden to have <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, to eat meat or drink wine, to gratify any sexual desire, to engage in any servile occupation, commerce or trade, to possess house or home, to practice magic, or to practice any other religion. Their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> were summed up in the three <em>signacula</em>, i.e. seals or closures, that of the mouth, of the hands, and of the breast (<em>oris, manuum, sinus</em>). The first forbade all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> words and all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> food. Animal food roused the demon of Darkness within man, hence only vegetables were allowed to the perfect. Amongst vegetables, some, as melons and fruit containing oil were specially recommended, as they were thought to contain many light particles, and by being consumed by the perfect those light particles were set free. The second forbade all actions detrimental to the light-substance, slaying of animals, plucking of fruit, etc. The third forbade all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts, whether against the Manich&aelig;an <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or against purity. St. Augustine (especially "De Moribus Manich.") strongly inveighs against the Manich&aelig;an's repudiation of marriage. They regarded it as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself because the propagation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> meant the continual <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of the light-substance in matter and a retarding of the blissful consummation of all things; maternity was a calamity and a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and Manich&aelig;ans delighted to tell of the seduction of Adam by Eve and her final punishment in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a>. In consequence there was a danger that the act of generation, rather than the act of unchastity was abhorred, and that his was a real danger Augustine's writings testify.

<p>The number of the Perfect was naturally very small and in studying Manich&aelig;ism one is particularly struck by the extreme paucity of individual Perfecti known in history. The vast bulk of Mani's adherents &#151; ninety-nine out of every hundred &#151; were Hearers. They were bound by Mani's <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">Ten Commandments</a> only, which forbade <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, mendacity, <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> (i.e. all killing), fornication, theft, seduction to deceit, magic, <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrisy</a>, (secret infidelity to Manich&aelig;ism), and <a href="../cathen/07759a.htm">religious indifference</a>. The first positive <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> seems to have been the maintenance and almost the worship of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">Elect</a>. They supplied them with vegetables for food and paid them homage on bended knee, asking for their blessing. They regarded them as superior beings, nay, collectively, they were thought to constitute the aeon of righteousness. Beyond these ten negative commandments there were the two <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> common to all, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> four times a day: at noon, late in the afternoon, after sunset, and three hours later. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> was made facing the sun or, in the night, the moon; when neither sun nor moon was visible, then the North, the throne of the Light-King. It was preceded by a ceremonial purification with water or for lack of water with some other substance in the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> fashion. The daily <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were accompanied by twelve prostrations and addressed to the various personalities in the realm of light: the Father of Majesty, the First-Man, the Legatus Tertius, the Paraclete (Mani), the Five Elements, and so on. They consist mainly of a string of laudatory epithets and contain but little supplication. As time and attitude of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> were intimately connected with <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> phenomena, so likewise was the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. All <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> on the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">first day of the week</a> in honor of the sun, the Perfect also <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> on the second day in honor of the moon. All kept the fast during two days after every new moon; and once a year at the full moon, and at the beginning of the first quarter of the moon. Moreover, a monthly fast, observed till sunset, was begun on the eighth day of the month.

<p>Of rites and ceremonies among the Manich&aelig;ans but very little is known to us. They had one great solemnity, that of the <em>Bema</em>, the anniversary of Mani's death. This was kept with a vigil of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and spiritual reading. An empty chair was placed on a raised platform to which five steps led up. Further details are as yet unknown. St. Augustine complains that although Manich&aelig;ans pretended to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, their feast of the death of Mani exceeded in solemnity that of the <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Death</a> and <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a>.

<p>Manich&aelig;ans must have possessed a kind of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and eucharist. The epistle on <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which occurred among the sacred literature of the Manich&aelig;ans, is unfortunately lost, and in Oriental sources the matter is not referred to, but <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sources suppose the existence of both these rites. Of greater importance than <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was the <em>Consolamentum</em> or "Consolation", an <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a> by one of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">Elect</a> by which a Hearer was received amongst their number. The Manich&aelig;an <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> and constitution is still involved in obscurity. Mani evidently intended to provide a supreme head for the multitude of his followers. He even decided that his successor in this dignity should reside in Babylon. This high <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is known in Arabic sources as the <em>Imamate.</em> In the East it seems to have possessed at least some temporary importance, in the West it seems hardly known or recognized. No list of these supreme Pontiffs of Manich&aelig;ism has come down to us; hardly a name or two is known to history. It is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> even whether the chair of Mani did not remain vacant for long periods. On the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and privileges of the Imamate we possess at present no information. According to Western and Eastern sources the Manich&aelig;an Church was divided into five hierarchical classes; St. Augustine names them <em>magistri, episcopi, presbyteri, electi,</em> and <em>auditores</em>; this <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianized</a> terminology represents in Manich&aelig;an mystical language the sons of meekness, of reason, of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, of mystery, and of understanding. Mani's <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrological</a> predilections for the number five, so evident in his <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogony</a>, evidently suggested this division for his Church or kingdom of the light on earth. The Teachers and Administrators (<em>magistri</em> and <em>episcopi</em>) are probably an adaptation of the <em>legontes</em> and <em>drontes</em>, the speakers and the doers, known in Greek and <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> mysteries; and the name "priests" is probably taken over from the Sabian Kura.

<p>With regard to the relation of Manich&aelig;ism to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> two things are clear:

<p>(a) Some connection with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was intended from the very first by Mani himself, it was not an after-thought, introduced when Manich&aelig;ism came in touch with the West, as is sometimes asserted. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was the predominant religion in Osrhoene, and perhaps the principle religion in all Mesopotamia in Mani's time. Mani, whose object was to found a system, comprehensive of all <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> then known, could not but try to incorporate <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. In the first words of his proclamation on the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> day of Sapor I, he mentioned <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, who had come to the countries of the West.

<p>(b) The connection was purely external and artificial. The substance of Manich&aelig;ism was Chaldean <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a> and folklore cast in a rigid <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a> mould; if <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was brought in, it was only through force of historical circumstances. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> could not be ignored. In consequence <ul> <li>Mani proclaimed himself the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a> promised by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>; <li>rejected the whole of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, but admitted as much of the New as suited him; in particular he rejected the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>, because it told of the descent of the Holy Ghost in the past. The gospels were corrupted in many places, but where a text seemed to favor him the Manichee <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to parade it. One has to read St. Augustine's anti-Manich&aelig;an disputes to realize the extreme ingenuity with which scripture texts were collected and interpreted. <li>Though Mani called himself the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a> he claimed no divinity but with show of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> styled himself "Apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> by the providence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a>"; a designation which is obviously adapted from the heading of the Pauline Epistles. Mani, however, was the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, i.e. the messenger of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promise, that <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a> whom he sent (apostolos from apostellos, to send) Mani's blasphemous assumption was thus toned down a little to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ears. <li><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was to Mani but an aeon or persistent personification of Light in the world.; as far as it had already been set free it was the luminous <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, or Jesus patibilis. <li>The historical <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a> was entirely repudiated by Mani. "The son of a poor <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>" (Mary),"the Jewish Messias whom the Jews crucified", "a devil who was justly punished for interfering in the work of the Aeon <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>", such was, according to Mani, the Christ whom <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> worshipped as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Mani's <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a> was purely <a href="../cathen/05070c.htm">Docetic</a>, his Christ appeared to be man, to live, suffer, and die to symbolize the light suffering in this world. Though Mani used the term <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">"Evangel"</a> for his message, his <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Evangel</a> was clearly in no real sense that of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. <li>Mani finally beguiled the unwary by the use of such apparently <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> terms as Father, Son, and Holy Ghost to designate divine personalities, but a glance at his <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogony</a> shows how flimsy was the disguise. Nevertheless, spoke so cautiously, urging only <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in god, His light, His power, and His wisdom (in reality" the Father of Majesty"; the sun and moon; the five blessed <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">aeons</a>, his sons, and the Manich&aelig;an religion), that they deceived many. </ul>
<h2 id="section3">History in the East</h2>

<p>Notwithstanding the bitterest <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> by the Sassanides in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> as well as by the emperors at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Manich&aelig;ism spread very rapidly. Its greatest success was achieved in countries to the east of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. In A.D. 1000 the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> historian Al-Beruni wrote: "The majority of the Eastern <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and Tibet, and a number in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> belong to the religion of Mani". The recent finds of Manich&aelig;an literature and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> at Turfan corroborate this statement. Within a generation after Mani's death his followers had settled on the Malabar Coast and gave the name to Minigrama, i.e. "Settlement of Mani". The Chinese inscriptions of Kara Belgassum, once thought to refer to the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, doubtless have reference to the existence of Manich&aelig;ism. The great <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> tribe of the Tuguzguz in 930 threatened reprisals on <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> in their power if the Manich&aelig;ans in Samarcand were molested by the Prince of Chorazan, in whose dominion they were very numerous. Detailed information on the extreme Eastern Manich&aelig;ans is still lacking. In <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> proper, Manich&aelig;ism seems never to have been the predominant religion, but the Manich&aelig;ans enjoyed there a large amount of prosperity and toleration under <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> rule. Some caliphs were actually favorable to Manich&aelig;ism, and it had a number of secret sympathizers throughout <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>. Though not numerous in the capitol, <a href="../cathen/02202c.htm">Bagdad</a>, they were scattered in the villages and hamlets of the Irak. Their prosperity and intimacy of social intercourse with non-Manich&aelig;ans aroused the indignation of the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritan</a> party amongst Mani's followers, and this led to the formation of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Miklas, a <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a> ascetic in the eighth century.

<p>As Manich&aelig;ism adopted three <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocrypha</a>, the Gospel of Thomas, the Teaching of Addas, and the Shepherd of Hermas, the legend was soon formed that Thomas, Addas, and Hermas were the first great apostles of Mani's system. Addas is supposed to have spread it in the Orient (<em>ta tes anatoles</em>), Thomas in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and Hermas in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Manich&aelig;ism was certainly known in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> before Mani's death; it was brought to Eleutheropolis by Akouas in 274 (Epiphanius, "Haer.", LXVI, I). St. Ephrem (378) complained that no country was more infected with Manich&aelig;ism than Mesopotamia in his day, and Manich&aelig;ism maintained its ground in <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> even in A.D. 450. The fact that it was combated by Eusebius of Emesus, George and Appolinaris of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>, <a href="../cathen/05008a.htm">Diodorus of Tarsus</a>, John (Chrysostom) of Antioch, <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">Epiphanius of Salamis</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14746a.htm">Titus of Bostra</a> shows how early and ubiquitous was the danger of Manich&aelig;ism in Western <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. About A.D. 404, Julia, a lady of Antioch, tried by her riches and culture to pervert the city of <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a> to Manich&aelig;ism, but without success. In <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> St. Cyril had many converted Manich&aelig;ans amongst his <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> and refuted their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> at length. <a href="../cathen/11079b.htm">St. Nilus</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of secret Manich&aelig;ans in Sinai before A.D. 430.

<p>In no country did Manich&aelig;ism enter more insidiously into <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life than in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. One of the governors of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> under Constantine was a Manich&aelig;an, who treated the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> with unheard-of severity. <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> says of Anthony the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">Hermit</a> (330) that he forbade all intercourse with "Manich&aelig;ans and other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>".

<p>In the Eastern Roman Empire it came to the zenith of its power about A.D. 375-400, but then rapidly declined. But in the middle of the sixth century it once more rose into prominence. The Emperor Justinian himself disputed with them; Photinus the Manich&aelig;an publicly disputed with Paul the Persian. Manich&aelig;ism obtained adherents among the highest classes of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Barsymes the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> prefect of Theodora, was an avowed Manich&aelig;an. But this recrudescence of Manich&aelig;ism was soon suppressed.

<p>Soon, however, whether under the name of <a href="../cathen/11583b.htm">Paulicians</a>, or Bogomiles, it again invaded the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>, after having lain hidden for a time on <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Musselman</a> territory. The following are the Imperial edicts launched against Manich&aelig;ism: <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> (Alexandria, 31 March, 296) commands the Proconsul of Africa to persecute them, he speaks of them as a sordid and impure <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> recently come from <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, which he is determined to destroy root and branch (<em>stirpitus amputari</em>). Its leaders and propagators must be burnt, together with their books; the rank and file beheaded, people of note condemned to the mines, and their goods confiscated. This edict remained at least nominally in force under Constantine, and Constantius. Under <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a>, Manich&aelig;ism seems to have been tolerated. Valentinian I and Gratian, though tolerant of other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, made exception of the Manich&aelig;ans. <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius I</a>, by an edict of 381, declared Manich&aelig;ans to be without civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and incapable of testamentary disposition. In the following year he condemned them to death under the name of <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a>, Saccophores, and <a href="../cathen/01660d.htm">Hydroparastates</a>. <a href="../cathen/15255a.htm">Valentinian II</a> confiscated their goods, annulled their wills, and sent them into exile. Honorius in 405 renewed the edicts of his predecessors, and fined all governors of cities or provinces who were remiss in carrying out his orders; he invalidated all their contracts, declared them outlaws and public criminals. In 445 <a href="../cathen/15255b.htm">Valentinian III</a> renewed the edicts of his predecessors; Anastasius condemned all Manich&aelig;ans to death; Justin and Justinian decreed the <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death penalty</a>, not only against Manich&aelig;ans who remained obstinate in their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, but even against converts from Manich&aelig;ism who remained in touch with their former co-religionists, or who did not at once denounce them to the magistrates. Heavy penalties were likewise decreed against all State officials who did not denounce their colleagues, if infected with Manich&aelig;ism, and against all those who retained Manich&aelig;an books. It was a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of extermination and was apparently successful, within the confines of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>.
<h2 id="section4">History in the West</h2>

<p>In the West the special home of Manich&aelig;ism was in Proconsular Africa, where it seems to have had a second apostle inferior only to Mani, a further incarnation of the <a href="../cathen/11469a.htm">Paraclete</a>, Adimantus. Previous to 296 Julian the Proconsul had written to the emperor that the Manich&aelig;ans troubled the peace of the population and caused injury to the towns. After the edict of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> we hear no more of it until the days of St. Augustine. Its most <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> champion was Faustus of <a href="../cathen/10304b.htm">Mileve</a>. Born at <a href="../cathen/10304b.htm">Mileve</a> of poor <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, he had gone to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and being converted to Manich&aelig;ism he began to study rhetoric somewhat late in life. He was not a man of profound erudition, but he was a suave and unctuous speaker. His fame in Manich&aelig;an circles was very great. He was a Manich&aelig;an <em>episcopus</em> and boasted of having left his wife and children and all he had for his religion. He arrived at Carthage in 383, and was arrested, but the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> obtained the commutation of his sentence to banishment and even that was not carried out. About A.D. 400 he wrote a work in favor of Manich&aelig;ism, or rather against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, in which he tried to wrest the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> to the support of Manich&aelig;ism. St. Augustine answered him in thirty-three books embodying verbally much of his teaching. On 28 and 29 August 392, St. Augustine had refuted a certain Fortunatus in public discussion held in the Baths of Sossius. Fortunatus acknowledged defeat and disappeared from the town. On 7 Dec., 404, St. Augustine held a dispute with Felix, a Manich&aelig;an <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He convinced him of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of his ways and he made him say: <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">Anathema</a> to Mani. St. Augustine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to use severity to extirpate the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Victorinus, a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> had become an <em>auditor</em> and propagandist of the Manich&aelig;ans. He was discovered, upon which he apparently repented and asked for reconciliation, but St. Augustine punished him and banished him from the town, warning all people against him. He would not hear of his repentance unless he denounced all the Manich&aelig;ans he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> in the province. St. Augustine did not write against Manich&aelig;ism during the last twenty five years of his life; hence it is thought that the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> decreased in importance during that time. Yet in 420, Ursus, the imperial prefect, arrested some Manich&aelig;ans in <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> and made them recant. When the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> conquered Africa the Manich&aelig;ans thought of gaining the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> by secretly entering their ranks, but Huneric (477-484), King of the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, realizing the danger, burnt many of them and transported the others. Yet at the end of the sixth century <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> looked upon Africa as the hotbed of Manich&aelig;ism. The same warning was repeated by <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Gregory II</a> (701), and <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a> (1061).

<p>The spread of Manich&aelig;ism in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and Gaul is involved in obscurity on account of the uncertainty concerning the real teaching of <a href="../cathen/12429b.htm">Priscillian</a>.

<p>It is well known how St. Augustine (383) found a home at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the Manich&aelig;an community, which must have been considerable. According to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> <a href="../cathen/10318a.htm">Pope Miltiades</a> (311-314) had already discovered adherents to the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> in the city. Valentinian's edict (372), addressed to the city prefect, was clearly launched mainly against Roman Manich&aelig;ans. The so called <a href="../cathen/01406a.htm">"Ambrosiaster"</a> combated Manich&aelig;ism in a great many of his writings (370-380). In the years 384-388 a special <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of Manich&aelig;ans arose in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> called Martari, or Mat-squatters, who, supported by a rich man called Constantius, tried to start a sort of monastic life for the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">Elect</a> in contravention of Mani's command that the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">Elect</a> should wander about the world preaching the Manich&aelig;an Gospel. The new <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> found the bitterest opposition amongst their co-religionists. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> they seem to have made extraordinary endeavors to conceal themselves by almost complete conformity with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> customs. From the middle of the sixth century onward Manich&aelig;ism apparently died out in the West. Though a number of <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a> and <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> may have existed here and there in obscurity, there is apparently no direct and conscious connection with the Prophet of Babylon and his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Yet when the <a href="../cathen/11583b.htm">Paulicians</a> and Bogomili from <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> came in contact with the West in the eleventh century, and eastern missionaries driven out by the Byzantine emperors taught dualist doctrines in the North of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and the South of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> they found the leaven of Manich&aelig;ism still so deeply pervading the minds of the many that they could make it ferment and rise into the formidable Catharist <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>.
<h2 id="section5">Manich&aelig;an writers</h2>

<p>Manich&aelig;ism, like <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>, was an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> religion, it despised the simplicity of the crowd. As it professed to bring <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> was <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Manich&aelig;ism, in consequence, was literary and refined, its founder was a fruitful writer, and so were many of his followers. Of all this literary output only fragments are at present extant. No Manich&aelig;an treatise has come down to us in its entirety. Mani wrote in Persian and <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> Aramaic, apparently using either language with equal facility. The following seven titles of works of his have come down to us: <ul> <li>"Shapurakan", I.e. "Princely", because it was dedicated to Peroz, the brother of Sapor I (written in Syrian). It was a kind of Manich&aelig;an <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">eschatology</a>, dealing in three chapters with the dissolution of Hearers, Elect, and Sinners. It was written about A.D. 242. <li>"The Book of Mysteries", polemical and dogmatic in character. <li>"The Book of the Giants", probably about <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogonic</a> figures. <li>"The Book of Precepts for Hearers", with appendix for the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">Elect</a>. <li>"The Book of Life-giving", written in Greek, probably of considerable size. <li>"The Book of Pragmateia", contents totally unknown. <li>"The Gospel", written in Persian, of which the chapters began with successive letters of the alphabet. </ul> Besides these more extensive works, no less than seventy-six letters or brief treatises are enumerated, but it is not always clear which of these are by Mani himself, which by his immediate successors. The "Epistola Fundamenti", so well known in Latin writers, is probably the "Treatise of the Two Elements", mentioned as first of the seventy-six numbers in Arabic sources. Small and often unintelligible fragments in Pahlevi and in Sogdian(?) have recently been found in Chinese Turkestan by T.W.K. Mueller. The "Epistola Fundamenti" is extensively quoted in St. Augustine's refutation and also in Theodore bar Khoni, and <a href="../cathen/14746a.htm">Titus of Bostra</a>, and the "Acta Archelai". Of Manich&aelig;an writers the following names have come down to us: Agapius (Photius, Cod. 179), of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>; Aphthonius of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (Philostorgium, "Hist. Eccl.", III, 15) Photinus refuted by Paul the Persian (Mercati, "Per la vita de Paulo il Persiano"), Adimantus, refuted by Augustine.
<h2 id="section6">Anti-Manich&aelig;an writers</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">St. Ephraem</a> (306-373); his treatise against the Manich&aelig;ans was published in poems (59-73) in the Roman edition with Latin translation and again by K. Kessler in his "Mani", I, 262-302; Hegemonius is said by Heracleon of Chalcedon to be the author of the "Acta disputationis Archelai episcopi Mesopotamiae et Manetis haeresiarchae". This important work on Manich&aelig;ism, written originally in Greek or perhaps in Syriac, between A.D. 300 and 350 has come down to us only in a Latin translation, though small fragments exist in Greek. The most recent edition is that of M. Beeson (Berlin, 1906). It contains an imaginary dispute between Archalaus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Charcar, and Mani, himself. The dispute is but a literary device, but the work ranks as the first class authority on Manich&aelig;ism. It was translated into English in the Ante-Nicene <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/01299a.htm">Alexander of Lycopolis</a> published a short treatise against Manich&aelig;ism, last edited by A. Brinkmann (Leipzig, 1895). Serapion of <a href="../cathen/14658a.htm">Thmuis</a> (c. 350) is credited by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> with an excellent work against Manich&aelig;ans. This work has recently been restored to its original form by A. Brinkmann "Sitz. ber der Preuss. Acad. Berlin"(1895), 479sqq. <a href="../cathen/14746a.htm">Titus of Bostra</a> (374) published four books against the Manich&aelig;ans, two containing arguments from reason and two arguements from Scripture and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. They have come down to us complete only in a Syriac version (LaGarde, "Tit. Bost. contra Manichaeos Libri IV", Berlin, 1859), but part of the original Greek is published in Pitra's "Analecta sacra. et class." (1888), I, 44-46. <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius of Salamis</a> devoted his great work "Adversus Haereses" (written about 374) mainly to refutation of Manich&aelig;ism. The other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> receive but brief notices and even <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> seems of less importance. Theodoret of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> (458), "De haereticorum fabulis", in four books (P.G. LXXXIII), gives an exposition of Manich&aelig;ism. Didymus the Blind, president of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> (345-395), wrote a treatise in eighteen chapters against Manich&aelig;ans. <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a> (c.750) Wrote a "Dialogue against Manich&aelig;ans" (P.G. XCIV), and a shorter "Discussion of John the Orthodox with a Manich&aelig;an" (P.G. XCVI); Photius (891) wrote four books against the Manich&aelig;ans, and is a valuable witness of the <a href="../cathen/11583b.htm">Paulician</a> phase of Manich&aelig;ism. Paul the Persian (c.529) "Disputation with Photinus the Manich&aelig;an" (P.G. LXXXVIII, 528). Zacharias Rhetor (c.536), "Seven theses against Manich&aelig;ans", fragments in P.G. LXXXV, 1143-. Heraclian (c.510) wrote twenty books against Manich&aelig;ans (Photius, Cod. 86). Amongst Latin writers St. Augustine is foremost, his works being "De utilitate credendi"; "De moribus Manichaeorum"; "De duabus animabus"; "Contra Fortunatum"; "De actis cum Felice", "De Natura Boni", "Contra Secundinum", "Contra Adversarium Legis et Prophetarum" in "Opera", VIII (Paris, 1837). Some in English. "De Genesi contra Manichaeos lib. II." <a href="../cathen/01406a.htm">Ambrosiaster</a> (370-380): for his commentaries on <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> and his "Quaestiones V. et N. Testamenti" see A. Souter, "A Study of Ambrosiaster" (1907); Marcus Victorinus (380), "Ad Justinum Manichaeum".

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">SOURCES.--Theodore bar Khoni, Nestorian Bishop of Cascar (c. end of sixth century), wrote a book of "Scholia" or Memoirs. Book XI of this work contains a list of "sects which arose at different times"; among these he gives an account of the Manich&aelig;ans and relates at length the Manich&aelig;an cosmogony. This is especially interesting and valuable as he retains the original Syriac designations of the cosmogonic figures and probably gives Mani's own account verbally from the Fundamental Epistle; in Pognon, Inscriptions mandaites des coupes de Khouabir (Paris, 1898), French tr. (see also M. Noldere Wiener, Zeitsch. Kund.
