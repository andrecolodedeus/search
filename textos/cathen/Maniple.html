<h1>Maniple</h1>  

<h3>Form, material, and use</h3>

<p>The maniple is an ornamental <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestment</a> in the form of a band, a little over a yard long and from somewhat over two to almost four inches wide, which is placed on the left arm in such manner that it falls in equal length on both sides of the arm. It is worn only during Mass, not at the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, during processions, nor at Benediction, etc.

<p>In order to fasten the maniple on the arm either two strings are placed on the inner side near the middle, or else an elastic band is used, or a loop is formed in the maniple itself by sewing together the two halves which have been laid over each other, at a distance of about six inches from the middle. Another device for securing the maniple is to set a small band a little to one side of the middle and to secure this band with a pin to the <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>.

<p>The maniple is made of silk or half-silk material. The colour is in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> rules. The ends of the maniple are often broader than the upper part, but too great a breadth at the ends, as in the so-called pocket or spade-shaped maniple, is ugly. In the middle and at each end the maniple is ornamented with a small cross; of these crosses that in the middle is always <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as it is prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. The maniple is worn by the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but not by those who have only received <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> the maniple is the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> sign of his rank, and at <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> is placed on his left arm by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself. A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> puts on the maniple at the altar after the <a href="../cathen/04222a.htm">Confiteor</a>, other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> put it on in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> before the service.
<h3>Name and origin</h3>

<p>In earlier ages the maniple was called by various names: <em>mappula, sudarium, mantile, fano, manuale, sestace,</em> and <em>manipulus</em>, appellations which indicate to some extent its original purpose. Originally it was a cloth of fine quality to wipe away perspiration, or an ornamental handkerchief which was seldom put into actual use, but was generally carried in the hand as an ornament. Ornamental handkerchiefs or cloths of this kind were carried by people of rank in ordinary life. Ancient remains show many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of this: for instance, the <em>mappa</em> with which the consul or praetor gave the signal for the commencement of the games was a similar cloth. The name <em>manipulus</em> was given because it was folded together and carried in the left hand like a small bundle (<em>manipulus</em>).
<h3>Antiquity</h3>

<p>Without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the maniple was first used at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At least it was worn at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> early in the sixth century even though not by all those <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> who later used it. The <em>pallialinostima</em> spoken of in the lives of Popes Sylvester and Zosimus, which appeared at this <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, can be explained with most probability as references to the ornamental vestment called later <em>mappula</em> and <em>manipulus.</em> About the close of the sixth century under the name of <em>mappula</em> it was also worn by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. (cf. the letters which passed between <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> and Archbishop John of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>). By the beginning of the ninth century the use of the maniple was almost universal in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, being customary even at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> which had otherwise its own peculiar rite. This is shown by the relief work on the celebrated <em>pallioto</em> (antependium) in the Basilica of St. Ambrose at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, a fine piece of goldsmith's work of the middle of the ninth century. The use of the maniple in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the statements of <a href="../cathen/01376b.htm">Amalar of Metz</a>, <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a>, Walafried Strabo, By the "Admonitio synodalis" and by other writings, as well as by various miniature <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>. That it was also worn in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> is evident from the elaborately worked maniple now in the Museum of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> which, according to the inscription <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered</a> on it, was made by order of Queen Aethelflaed (d. before 916), wife of Edward the Elder for Bishop Frithestan of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the ninth century even the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> wore the maniple. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries the singular custom prevailed at Cluny and other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> that on the chief feast days all, even the Lay brothers, appeared at Mass in <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a> and maniple; this practice, however, was forbidden in 1100 by the Synod of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>. When in the eleventh and twelfth centuries the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> developed into a higher order, the maniple became its distinctive vestment.
<h3>Nature and mode of wearing</h3>

<p>The maniple was originally a folded piece of cloth. It cannot be positively decided when it became a plain band. Probably the change did not occur everywhere at the same time. Maniples made of a fold of material existed at least as early as the beginning of the tenth century; this is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the maniple at <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a> made for Bishop Frithestan. About the end of the first millennium it was hardly more than an ornamental band. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries these bands were, as a rule, very long and narrow and had laid on at the ends for ornament squares or rectangular pieces of material; after a while, however, this form of maniple went out of use. In the sixteenth century it began to be customary to broaden the ends, giving them something of the form of a spade, until in the eighteenth century the shape of the ends became completely that of a spade or pocket. For the period up to the twelfth century almost nothing is known as to the material of which the maniple was made. In the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it was generally of silk. As early as the tenth century much importance was attached to its ornamentation. The inventories of this time repeatedly mention costly maniples adorned with gold or silver. In the succeeding centuries even more importance was attached to the rich ornamentation of the maniple. It was enriched, so the inventories inform us, with <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a>, small ornaments of precious metals, precious stones, and pearls. Maniples of this period with costly <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a> are to be found in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Sisters of Notre-Dame at <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>, at <a href="../cathen/12233a.htm">Pontigny</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/02358b.htm">Bayeux</a>, in the Museum of Industrial Art at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, etc. A favourite way to finish the ends was with fringe, tassels, or little bells. The maniple had generally no crosses at the ends or in the middle. Originally it was held in the left hand; from the eleventh century, however, it became customary to carry it on the lower part of the left arm and the usage has remained the same up to the present day. Even in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> it was seldom worn except at Mass. The <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of giving the maniple to the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> at <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> developed in the tenth to the eleventh century, but it was not until the thirteenth century that the custom became universal.
<h3>Symbolism</h3>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the maniple received various symbolical interpretations. At a later period it was common to connect this vestment with the bonds which held the hands of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> offered by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> when putting on the maniple are symbolized the cares and sorrows of this earthly life which should be borne with patience in view of the heavenly reward.
<h2>Epigonation</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> the vestment that corresponds to the maniple is the <em>epigonation.</em> It is a square piece of material often <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered</a> with a sword and intended as an ornament; it is hung at the right side on the <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a> and falls to the knee. The epigonation does not belong to all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> but only to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Originally also an ornamental handkerchief and called at that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> <em>encheirion</em> it received its present form in the twelfth century.
<h2>Subcinctorium</h2>

<p>Very similar to the maniple in form and nature is the subcinctorium, an ornamental vestment reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. It is worn on the <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a>; on one end is <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidered</a> a small Agnus Dei and on the other a cross. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> wears it only at a solemn <a href="../cathen/12232a.htm">pontifical Mass</a>. The subcinctorium is mentioned under the name of <em>balteus</em> as early as the end of the tenth century in a "Sacramentarium" of this date preserved in the Bibliotheque Nationale at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (f. lat. 12052). It is mentioned under the name <em>proecinctorium</em> about 1030 in what is known as the "Missa Illyrica". Later it was generally called subcinctorium. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it was worn not only by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> but also by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and even in a few places by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. However, it gradually ceased to be a customary vestment of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and in the sixteenth century only the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> wore it. The original object of the subcinctorium was, as <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> explicitly says, to secure the <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a>. But as early as about the close of the thirteenth century, it was merely an ornamental vestment. According to the inventories, even in the eleventh century much thought was given to its ornamentation. Most probably the subcinctorium was first used in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, whence the custom may possibly have spread to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> about the close of the first millennium.
