<h1>Manuel Chrysoloras</h1>  

<p>First teacher of Greek in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, born at Constantinople about the middle of the fourteenth century; died at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, German, and was buried there, 15 April, 1415. His first visit to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was at the time of the siege of Constantinople, when he was sent to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> by Emperor Pal&aelig;ologus to implore the aid of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes. He returned to Constantinople. In 1396 he went to Florence at the invitation of the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanists</a> of that city, <a href="../cathen/13405b.htm">Salutato</a>, Niccolo de Niccoli, and their friends, as professor of Greek literature. He severed his connection with the Florentine government, however, before the time for the end of the agreement had expired, owing either to intrigues which Bruno and Filelfo attributed to Niccoli, or perhaps to his moody temperament. He was then engaged in teaching at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and afterwards at Pavia. In 1404 he was Manual Pal&aelig;ologus's ambassador in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in the same capacity. He was also actively employed in promoting a union of the Greek with the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>, and with that object in view returned once more to Constantinople. In 1413 <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> chose him to accompany the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> sent as delegates to the emperor Sigismund to fix a place for the assembling of a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> was chosen. He is mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of convocation. He probably accompanied <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> to <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Constance</a> (1414) and died there the following year. His death gave rise to commemorative essays of which <a href="../cathen/07053a.htm">Guarino of Verona</a> made a collection in "Chysolorina".

<p>Chysoloras's works include opuscules on the Procession of the Holy Ghost; "Epistol&aelig; tres de comparatione veteris et nov&aelig; Rom&aelig;"; letters to his brothers, to L. Bruni, to Guauni, to Traversari, to Pallas Strozzi. He also translated <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> "Republic" into Latin. Finally he is the author of the first modern Greek grammar, the "Erotemeta" printed for the first time at Florence in 1484, and immediately studied by Linacre at Oxford and by <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>. He was chiefly influential through his teaching in familiarizing men such as Bruni, <a href="../cathen/13405b.htm">Salutato</a>, Giacomo da Scarparia, Roberto de' Rossi, Carlo Marsuppini, <a href="../cathen/15353b.htm">Vergerio</a>, Decembrie, Guauni, Poggio, with the masterpieces of Greek literature. As an oral teacher he was too verbose and diffuse. As a man, however, such nobility of character and integrity was rarely met with in the Greek teachers so succeeded him in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.
