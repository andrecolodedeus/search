<h1>Manuscripts of the Bible</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">Manuscripts</a> are written, as opposed to printed, copies of the original text or of a version either of the whole Bible or of a part thereof. After introductory remarks on <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in general, we shall take up in detail the Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Syriac, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic</a> manuscripts of the Bible; <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of other versions are not important enough to come within the scope of this article.
<h2 id="section1">In general</h2>

<p>Manuscripts may be conveniently divided into papyrus and vellum <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>.
<h3 id="A">Papyrus manuscripts</h3>

<p>In the Roman Empire of the first three centuries of our era, papyrus was the ordinary writing material. Made out of strips of pith taken from the stem of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> water-plant of the same name, papyrus was very fragile, became brittle in air, crumbled with use, could not resist the disintegrating force of moisture and was quite impracticable for book-form. All papyrus <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of every sort are lost to us save such as were buried in exceedingly dry soil, like that of Upper and Middle <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Here the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> fellaheen at one time wantonly destroyed vast quantities of papyrus <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> excavators now prevent such destruction and keep on adding to our very considerable collections of papyri. It is more than likely that the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> sacred writers or their scribes used ink and rolls of fragile papyrus for their <em>autographa</em> (<a href="../bible/2co003.htm#vrs3">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>; <a href="../bible/2jo001.htm#vrs12">2 John 12</a>). These original <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> probably perished towards the end of the first or the opening of the second century. We find no trace of them in either the Apostolic or the apologetic Fathers, &#151; unless we except <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian's</a> words, "the authentic letters of the Apostles themselves", which are now generally set aside as rhetorical. A significant <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the early loss of the autograph copies of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is the fact that Iren&aelig;us never appeals to the original writings but only to all the painstaking and ancient copies (<em>en pasi tois spoudaiois kaiarchaiois antigraphois</em>), to the witness of those that saw John face to face (<em>kaimartyrounton auton ekeinon ton katopsin ton Ioannen heorakoton</em>), and to the internal evidence of the written word (<em>kai tou logou didaskontos hemas</em>).
<h3 id="B">Vellum manuscripts</h3>

<p>Egypt clung to her papyrus rolls until the eighth century and even later. Vellum had been used before the time of Christ (cf. Pliny, "Historia Naturalis", xiii, 11), and during the time of the Apostles (<a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs13">2 Timothy 4:13</a>). In the third century, it began, outside of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, to supersede papyrus; in the early part of the fourth century vellum and the codex, or book-form, gained complete victory over papyrus and the roll-form. When Constantine founded his capital of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>, he ordered <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> to have fifty manuscripts of the Bible made on vellum (<em>somatia en diphtherais</em>) for use in the churches of Byzantium (Vita Constant., IV, 36). To the fourth century belong the earliest extant Biblical <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of anything but fragmentary size.
<h3 id="C">Palimpsests</h3>

<p>Some vellum <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the greatest importance are palimpsests (from Lat. <em>palimpsestum</em>, Gr. <em>palimpsestos</em>, "scraped again"), &#151; that is, they were long ago scraped a second time with pumice-stone and written upon anew. The discovery of palimpsests led to the reckless of bigoted charge of wholesale destruction of Biblical <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of old. That there was some such destruction is clear enough from the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of a Greek synod of A.D. 691, which forbade the use of palimpsest <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> either of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> or of the Fathers, unless they were utterly unserviceable (see Wattenbach, "Das Schriftwessen im Mittelalter", 1896, p. 299). That such destruction was not wholesale, but had to do with only worn or damaged <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, is in like manner clear enough from the significant fact that as yet no complete work of any kind has been found on a palimpsest. The deciphering of a palimpsest may at times be accomplished merely by soaking it in clear water; generally speaking, some chemical reagent is required, in order to bring back the original writing. Such chemical reagents are an infusion of nutgalls, Gioberti's tincture and hydrosulphuret of ammonia; all do harm to the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>. Wattenbach, a leading authority on the subject, says: "More precious <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, in proportion to the existing supply, have been destroyed by the learned experimenters of our time than by the much abused <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of old."
<h2 id="section2">Hebrew manuscripts</h2>
<h3 id="A">Age</h3>

<p><em>(a) Pre-Massoretic text</em>

<p>The earliest Hebrew <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> is the Nash papyrus. There are four fragments, which, when pieced together, give twenty-four lines of a pre-Massoretic text of the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">Ten Commandments</a> and the <em>shema</em> (<a href="../bible/exo020.htm#vrs2">Exodus 20:2-17</a>; <a href="../bible/deu005.htm#vrs6">Deuteronomy 5:6-19</a>; 6:4-5). The writing is without vowels and seems <a href="../cathen/11403a.htm">pal&aelig;ographically</a> to be not later than the second century. This is the oldest extant Bible <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> (see Cook, "A Pre-Massoretic Biblical Papyrus" in "Proceed. of the Soc. of Bib. Arch.", Jan., 1903). It agrees at times with the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> against the <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massorah</a>. Another pre-Massoretic text is the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> recension is probably pre-exilic; it has come down to us free from <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> influences, is written without vowels and in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> characters. The earliest <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> extant is that of Nabl&ucirc;s, which was formerly rated very much earlier than all <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, but is now assigned to the twelfth or thirteenth century A.D. Here mention should be made of the non-Massoretic Hebrew <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the Book of Ecclesiasticus. These fragments, obtained from a Cairo <em>genizah</em> (a box for wornout or cast-off <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>), belong to the tenth or eleventh century of our era. They provide us with more than a half of Ecclesiasticus and duplicate certain portions of the book. Many scholars deem that the Cairo fragments prove Hebrew to have been the original language of Ecclesiasticus (see "Facsimiles of the Fragments hitherto recovered of the Book of Ecclesiasticus in Hebrew", <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a> and Cambridge, 1901).


<p><em>(b) Massoretic text</em>

<p>All other Hebrew manuscripts of the Bible are <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> (see <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">MASSORAH</a>), and belong to the tenth century or later. Some of these <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> earlier. Text-critics consider these dates to be due either to intentional <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> or to uncritical transcription of dates of older <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. For instance, a codex of the Former and Latter Prophets, how in the Karaite <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of Cairo, is dated A.D. 895; Neubauer assigns it to the eleventh or thirteenth century. The Cambridge <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> no. 12, dated A.D. 856, he marks as a thirteenth-century work; the date A.D. 489, attached to the St. Petersburg <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, he rejects as utterly impossible (see Studia Biblica, III, 22). Probably the earliest <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are: "Prophetarium Posteriorum Codex Bablyonicus Petropolitanus", dated A.D. 916; the St. Petersburg Bible, written by Samuel ben Jacob and dated A.D. 1009; and "Codex Oriental. 4445" in the British Museum, which Ginsburg (Introduction, p. 469) assigns to A.D. 820-50. The text critics differ very widely in the dates they assign to certain Hebrew <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> is included to think that at most nine or ten <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are earlier than the twelfth century (Vari&aelig; Lectiones, I, p. xv).
<h3 id="B">Number</h3>

<p>Kennicott, the first critical student of the <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> text, either examined or had others examine 16 <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, some 40 printed texts and 638 <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> (see "Dissertatio Generalis in Vetus Testam. Hebraicum", Oxford, 1780). He numbered these <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in six groups: nos. 1-88, Oxford <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>; nos. 89-144, other <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of English-speaking countries; nos. 145-254, <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of continental <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; nos. 255-300, printed texts and various <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>; nos. 301-694, <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> collated by Brunsius. <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> (Vari&aelig; Lectiones Vet. Test.) retained the numeration of Kennicott and added a list of 479 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, all his own personal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, of which unfortunately 17 had already received numbers from Kennicott. <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> later added four supplementary lists of 110, 52, 37, and 76 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. He brought the number of <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> up to 1375. No one has since undertaken so colossal a critical study of the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. A few of the chief <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are more exactly collated and compared in the critical editions of the <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> text which were done by S. Baer and Fr. Delitzsch and by Ginsburg. To the vast number of Hebrew <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> examined by Kennicott and <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> must be added some 2000 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the Imperial Library of St. Petersburg, which Firkowitsch collated at Tschufut-Kale ("Jews' Rock") in the Crimea (see Strack, "Die biblischen und massoretischen Handschriften z&uuml; Tschufut-Kale" in "Zeits. f&uuml;r luth. Theol. und Kirche", 1875).
<h3 id="C">Worth</h3>

<p>The critical study of this rich assortment of about 3400 <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> rolls and <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> is not so promising of important results as it would at first thought seem to be. The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are all of quite recent date, if compared with Greek, Latin, and Syriac <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a>. They are all singularly alike. Some few variants are found in copies made for private use; copies made for public service in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> are so uniform as to deter the critic from comparing them. All <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> bring us back to one editor &#151; that of a textual tradition which probably began in the second century and became more and more minute until every jot and tittle of the text was almost absolutely fixed and sacred. R. Aqiba seems to have been the head of this Jewish <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the second century. Unprecedented means were taken to keep the text fixed. The scholars counted the words and consonants of each book, the middle word and middle consonants, the peculiarities of script, etc. Even when such peculiarities were clearly due to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> or to accident, they were perpetuated and interpreted by a mystical meaning. Broken and inverted letters, consonants that were too small or too large, dots which were out of place &#151; all these oddities were handed down as God-intended. In <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#vrs4">Genesis 2:4</a>, <em>bebram</em> ("when they were created"), all <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> have a small <em>H&ecirc;</em>. Jewish scholars looked upon this peculiarity as inspired; they interpreted it: "In the letter <em>H&ecirc;</em> he created them"; and then set themselves to find out what that meant.This lack of variants in <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> leaves us hopeless of reaching back to the original Hebrew text save through the versions. Kittel in his splendid Hebrew text gives such variants as the versions suggest.
<h2 id="section3">Greek manuscripts</h2>
<h3 id="A">In general</h3>

<p>Greek <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are divided into two classes according to their style of writing &#151; <em>uncials</em> and <em>minuscules.</em>

<p>(a) <em>Uncials</em> were written between the fourth and tenth centuries, with large and disconnected letters. These letters were not capitals but had a distinctive form: <em>epsilon, sigma</em>, and <em>omega</em> were not written <em>EPSILON, SIGMA, OMEGA</em>, as are those capitals in inscriptions; <em>rho, phi, psi</em>, and at times <em>upsilon</em> were prolonged above or below the line. Words were not separated; neither accents nor punctuation marks were used; paragraphs were marked off only by a very small lacuna; the letters were uniform and artistic; ligatures were used only for the most ordinary words &#151; IC (<em>Iesous</em>), KC (<em>Kyrios</em>), XC (<em>Christos</em>), ICL (<em>Israel</em>), PNA (<em>pneuma</em>), DLD (<em>David</em>), ANOC (<em>anthropos</em>), PER (<em>pater</em>), MER (<em>mater</em>), OUC (<em>pater</em>), CER (<em>soter</em>), OUNOC (<em>ouranos</em>). In the sixth century, began a decadence of the elegant uncial writing. Twists and turns were given to certain letters. In the seventh century, more letters received flourishes; accents and breathings were introduced; the writing leaned to the right.

<p><em>(b) Minuscules</em>

<p>While uncials held sway in Biblical <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, minuscules were employed in other works. During the ninth century, both uncial and minuscule manuscripts of the Bible were written. The latter show a form of writing so fully developed as to leave no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about its long standing use. The letters are small, connected, and written with a running hand. After the tenth century, minuscules were used until, in the fifteenth century, <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were superceded by print.
<h3 id="B">Old Testament manuscripts</h3>

<p><em>(a) Septuagint (LXX)</em>

<p>There are three <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> &#151; the <a href="../cathen/07316a.htm">Hexaplaric</a>, Hesychian, and Lucianic. Manuscripts of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> <a href="../cathen/07316a.htm">Hexapla</a> and Tetrapla were preserved at C&aelig;sarea by his disciple <a href="../cathen/11436b.htm">Pamphilus</a>. Some extant <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> (v.g. <em>aleph</em> and Q) refer in scholia to these gigantic works of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. In the fourth century, <a href="../cathen/11436b.htm">Pamphilus</a> and his disciple <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea</a> reproduced the fifth column of the <a href="../cathen/07316a.htm">Hexapla</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> <a href="../cathen/07316a.htm">Hexaplaric</a> <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> text, with all his critical signs. This copy is the source of the <a href="../cathen/07316a.htm">Hexaplaric</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. In course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, scribes omitted the critical signs in part or entirely. Passages wanting in the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, but present in the Hebrew, and consequently supplied by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> from either Aquila or Tehodotion, were hopelessly commingled with passages of the then extant <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>. Almost at the same time two other editions of the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> were published &#151; those of Hesychius at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and of Lucian at Antioch. From these three editions the extant <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> have descended, but by ways that have not yet been accurately traced. Very few <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> can be assigned with more than probability to one of the three <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07316a.htm">Hexaplaric</a>, Hesychian, and Lucianic <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> acted one upon the other. Most extant <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> contain, as a result, readings of each and of none of the great <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. The tracing of the influence of these three great <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> is a work yet to be done by the text-critics. <ul> <li><em>Papyrus.</em> &#151; About sixteen fragments on papyrus are extant. Of these, the most important are: <ul> <li>Oxyrhyncus Pap. 656 (early third cent.), containing parts of <a href="../bible/gen014.htm">Genesis 14</a>-<a href="../bible/gen027.htm">27</a>, wherein most of the great vellum <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are wanting. <li>British Museum Pap. 37, at times called U (seventh cent.), containing part of Psalms (Hebrew) x-xxxiii. <li>A Leipzig Pap. (fourth cent.) containing Psalms xxix-liv. These two <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalters</a> give us the text of Upper <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. <li>A Heidelberg Pap. (seventh cent.) containing Azch., iv, 6-Mal., iv, 5. <li>A Berlin Pap. (fourth or fifth cent.) containing about thirty chapters of Genesis. </ul> <li><em>Vellum Uncial. --</em> Parsons collated 13 uncial and 298 minuscule <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>; the former he designated with Roman numerals, I-XIII, the latter with Arabic numbers, 14-311 (cf., "V.T.

<h3 id="C">New Testament manuscripts</h3>

<p><em>(a) In General</em>

<p>There are, according to the latest authority on this subject, von Soden ("Die Schriften des N.T. in ihrer &auml;ltesten erreichbaren Textgestalt", Berlin, 1902), 2328 <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> extant. Only about 40 contain, either entire or in part, all the books of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. There are 1716 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> copies of the Gospels, 531 of the Act, 628 of the Pauline Epistles, 219 of the Apocalypse. The commonly received numeration of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> is that of Wettstein; uncials are designated by Roman and Greek capital, minuscules by Arabic numbers. These <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are divided into the above-mentioned four groups &#151; Gospels, Acts, Pauline Epistles, Apocalypse. In the case of uncials, an exponent is used to designate the group referred to. D or Dev is <a href="../cathen/04083a.htm">Cod. Bez&aelig;</a>, a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the Gospels; D3 or D<em>paul</em> is Cod. Claromontanus, a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the Pauline Epistles; E2 or E<em>act</em> is Cod. Laudianus, a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the Acts. The nomenclature is less clear for minuscules. Each group has a different set of numbers. If a minuscule be a complete <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, it is designated by four different numbers. One and the same <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> at Leicester is Evan. 69, Act. 31, Paul. 37, Apoc. 14. Wettestein's lists of New-Testament <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were supplemented by Birch and Schols; later on Scrivener and Gregory continued the lists, each with his own nomenclature. Von Soden has introduced a new numeration, so as to indicate the contents and date of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. If the content be more than the Gospels, it is marked <em>delta</em> (that is, <em>diatheke</em>, "testament"); if only the Gospels, <em>eta</em> (i.e., <em>euaggelion</em>, "gospel"); if aught else save the Gospels, <em>alpha</em> (that is, <em>apostolos</em>). B is <em>delta</em>-1; <em>aleph</em> is <em>delta</em>-2; Q is <em>epsilon</em>-4, etc. No distinction is made between uncials and minuscules. Scholars admit the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> and scientific worth of this new numeration, but find it too unwieldy and impracticable.

<p><em>(b) Payrus</em>

<p>In the Archduke Rainer collection, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, are several very fragmentary bits of <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> Greek phrases, which Wessely, the curator of that collection, assigns to the second century. The Grenfell and Hunt excavations in Oxyrhyncus brought to light various fragments of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> which Kenyon, the assistant keeper of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the British Museum, assigns to the latter part of the third century. Only one papyrus <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is important to the text-critic &#151; Oxyrhyncus Pap. 657, third-fourth century; it preserves to us about a third of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and epistle in which <a href="../cathen/04086a.htm">Codex B</a> is defective.

<p><em>(c) Vellum Uncials</em>

<p>There are about 160 vellum uncials of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; some 110 contain the Gospels or a part thereof. The chiefest of these uncials are the four great <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> of the entire Greek Bible, <em>aleph</em>, A, B, C, for which, see above. The Vatican (B) is the oldest and probably the best <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>. <ul><li>D. or <em><a href="../cathen/04083a.htm">Cod. Bez&aelig;</a></em> (q.v.) (fifth or sixth century; in University Library, Cambridge) contains Gospels and Acts in Gr. and Lat., excepting <a href="../bible/act022.htm">Acts 22:29</a> to the end; it is a unique specimen of a Greek <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> whose text is Western, i.e. that the Old Latin and Old Syriac. <li>D3 or <em>Cod. Claromonianus</em> (probably sixth century; in Nat. Libr., <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>) contains Pauline Epistles in Gr. and Lat., each text independent of the other. Before Hebrews is a list of the books of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and the number of lines (<em>stichoi</em>) in each; this list omits Thess., Heb., and Phil., includes four <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> books, and follows an unusual order: Matt., John, Mark, Luke, Rom., I and II Cor., Gal., <a href="../bible/eph000.htm">Ephesians</a>, 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, Col., Philem., I and II Pet., James, I, II and III John, Jude, Barnabas, Apoc., Acts, Hermas, Acts of Paul, Apoc. of Peter. <li>E, or <em>Cod. Basileensis</em> (eighth century; in Univ. Libr., Basle) contains the Gospels. <li>E2, or <em>Cod. Laudianus</em> (sixth century; Oxford, in Bodl. Library) contains Acts in Gr. and Lat. The former is somewhat like D. <li>E3, or <em>Cod. Sangermanensis</em> (ninth century; in Imper. Libr., St. Petersburg) contains Pauline Epistles in Gr. and Lat.; of same <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> as D3. <li>F, or <em>Cod. Boreeli</em> (ninth century; at <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>), contains Gospels. <li>F3, or <em>Cod. Augiensis</em> (ninth century; in Trinity College, Cambridge), contains Pauline Epp. in Gr. and Lat.; of the same <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> as D3, E3, and G3. <li>G, or <em>Cod. Wolfii A</em> (ninth or tenth century; at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, and London), contains the Gospels. <li>G3, or <em>Cod. Boernerianus</em> (ninth century; at <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>), contains Paul Epp. in Gr. and Lat.; text of D3 type. <li>H, or <em>Cod. Wolfii B</em> (ninth or tenth century; at <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>), contains Paul Epp. in Gr. and Lat.; text of D3 type. <li>H2, or <em>Cod. Mutinensis</em> (ninth century; at <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>), contains Acts. <li>H3, or <em>Cod. Coislinianus</em> (sixth century; originally at <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Mt. Athos</a> where 8 leaves remain. Other parts were used for binding <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>; 22 leaves thus reached <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; 3 which were discovered at St. Petersburg, <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> and Kieff; 1 in <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>). This <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> gives us, in great part, a fourth-century text of Euthalius of Sulca. <li>K, or <em>Cod. Cyprius</em> (ninth century; in Nat. Libr., <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>), contains the Gospels. <li>K2, or <em>Cod. Mosquensis</em> (ninth century; in Holy Synod Library, <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a>), contains Acts, Cath., and Paul. Epp. <li>L, or <em>Cod. Regius</em> (eighth century; in Nat.

Libr., <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>), contains Gospels. <li>N, or <em>Cod. Purpureus</em>, called also <em>Petropolitanus</em> (sixth century), contains Gospels in silver on purple vellum. About half the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> is extant: 182 leaves (found in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, 1896) are in St. Petersburg, 33 at Patmos, 6 in the Vatican, 4 in British Museum, and 2 in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. <li>P, or <em>Cod. Guelferbytanus A</em> (sixth century; Wolfenb&uuml;ttel), contains Gosp. fragments. <li>P2, or <em>Cod. Porphyrianus</em> (ninth century; in St. Petersburg), contains Acts, Cath. and Paul. Epp. <li>Q, or <em>Cod. Guelferbytanus B</em> (fifth century; Wolfenb&uuml;ttel), contains Gosp. fragments. <li>R, or <em>Cod. Nitriensis</em> (sixth century; in British Museum, London), a palimpsest copy of Luke. <li>T, or <em>Cod. Borgianus</em> (fifth century; in Vatican), Gr. and Sahidic fragments. One has the double-ending of Mark; another has 17 leaves of Luke and John, and a text akin to B and <em>alpha</em> <li>Z, or <em>Cod. Dublinensis</em> (sixth century; in Trinity Col., Dublin), a palimpsest containing 295 verses of Matt.; text probably <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, akin to <em>aleph</em> <li><em>Delta</em>, or <em>Cod.

Rossanensis</em> (sixth century; at <a href="../cathen/13203a.htm">Rossano</a>, in Calabria), contains Matt. and Mark, in silver letters on purple vellum with illustrations. N, <em>Sigma</em>, <em>Sigma</em>-b, and <em>Phi</em> are all akin and were probably produced at Constantinople from a single ancestor. <li><em>Sigma</em>-b, or <em>Cod. Sinopensis</em> (sixth century; in Nat. Libr., <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>), consists of 43 leaves (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm">Matthew 7-24</a>), in gold letters on purple vellum with 5 illustrations; it was bought by a French naval officer for a few francs, at <a href="../cathen/14014b.htm">Sinope</a>, in 1899, and is called also <em>Omicron</em> and <em>H&ecirc;</em>. <li><em>Phi</em>, or <em>Cod. Beratinus</em> (sixth century; at Berat in Albania), contains Matt. and Mark. <li><em>Beth</em>, or <em>Cod. Patirensis</em> (fifth century; in the Vatican), contains Act., Cath. and Paul. Epp. <li>The <em>American <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the Gospels</em> (fifth century), found in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, 1907, has not yet been published; nor have the fragments of the Pauline Epistles (sixth century) which were found at the same time. </ul>

<p><em>(d) Vellum minuscules</em>

<p>The vast numbers of minuscule witnesses to the text of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> would seem to indicate a rich field of investigation for the text-critic. The field is not so rich at all. Many of these minuscules have never been fully studies. Ninety-five per cent. of them are witnesses to the same type of text; that of the <em>textus receptus.</em> Only those minuscules interest the text-critic which are distinctive of or akin to one of the great uncials. Among the Gospel minuscules, according to Gregory's numeration, the type of B-<em>aleph</em> is seen more or less in 33; 1, 118, 131, 209; 59, 157, 431, 496, 892. The type of D is that of 235, 431, 473, 700, 1071; and of the "Ferrar group", 13, 69, 124, 346, 348, 543, 713, 788, 826, 828. Among the Acts minuscules, 31 and 61 show some kinship to B; 137, 180, 216, 224 to D. 15, 40, 83, 205, 317, 328, 329, 393 are grouped and traced to the fourth century text of Euthalius of Sulica. Among the Pauline minuscules, this same text (i.e. that of H3) is found in 81, 83, 93, 379, 381.

<p><em>(e) Lectionaries</em>

<p>There are some 1100 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of readings from the Gospels (<em>Evangelia</em> or <em>Evangeliaria</em>) and 300 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of readings from Acts and Epistles (<em>Praxapostoli</em>). Although more than 100 of these lectionaries are uncials, they are of the ninth century or later. Very few of these books of the Epistles and Gospels have been critically examined. Such examination may later on serve to group the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> minuscules better and help to localize them.
<h2 id="section4">Latin manuscripts</h2>

<p>Biblical <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are far more uniform in Greek than in Latin script. <a href="../cathen/11403a.htm">Pal&aelig;ography</a> divides the Greek into uncials and minuscules; the Latin into uncials, semi-uncials, capitals, minuscules and cursives. Even these divisions have subdivisions. The time, place and even <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of a Latin <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> may be traced by the very distinct script of its text.
<h3 id="A">Old Latin</h3>

<p>Some 40 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> have preserved to us a text which antedates the translation of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>; they are designated by small letters. Unfortunately no two of these <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> represent to us quite the same text. Corrections introduced by scribes and the inevitable influence of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> have left it a very difficult matter to group the Old Latin <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. Text-critics now agree upon an African, a <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> and an Italian type of text. The African text is that mentioned by <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (c. 150-220) and used by <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (c. 200-258); it is the earliest and crudest in style. The <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> text is less crude in style and vocabulary, and may be an entirely new translation. The Italian text is a version of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> and was revised by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> in parts of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. The most important Old Latin <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are the bilingual <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> D, D3, E2, E3, F3, G3, <em>Delta</em>. <ul><li>a, or <em>Cod. Vercellensis</em> (fourth century; at <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>), containing the Gospels. <li>b, or <em>Cod. Veronensis</em> (fifth century; at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>), containing Gospels on purple vellum. a and b are our chief witnesses to the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> text of the Gospels. <li>e, or <em>Cod. Palatinus</em> (fifth century; at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, &#151; one leaf is in Dublin), contains the Gosp. For Acts, e is Lat. of E2; for Paul. Epp., e is Lat. of E3. <li>f, or <em>Cod. Brixianus</em> (sixth century; at <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>), contains Gosp. on purple vellum; Italian type, thought by Wordsworth and White to be the best extant representative of the Old Latin text which <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> used when revising the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. <li>ff2, or <em>Cod. Corbeiensis</em> (fifth century; at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>), contains the Gospels. <li>g, or <em>Cod. Gigas</em> (thirteenth century; at <a href="../cathen/14297a.htm">Stockholm</a>), a complete Bible; Acts and Apoc. are in Old Latin text and are the chief representative of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> type. <li>h, or <em>Palimpsest de Fleury</em> (fourth or fifth century; at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>), contains <a href="../bible/mar007.htm">Mark 7</a>-<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs8">16:8</a> and <a href="../bible/mat001.htm">Matthew 1-15</a>; earliest form of Old Latin, African type, closely akin to text used by <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Saint Cyprian</a>. <li>q, or <em>Cod. Monacensis</em> (sixth or seventh century; at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, contains Gospels; Italian type of text. </ul>
<h3 id="B">Vulgate</h3>

<p>It is estimated that there are more than 8000 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> extant. Most of these are later than the twelfth century and have very little worth for the reconstruction of the text. Tischendorf and Berger designate the chief <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> by abbreviations of the names: am. = Amiatinus; fu. or fuld. = Fuldensis. Wordsworth and White, in their critical edition of the Gospel and Acts (1899-1905); use Latin capitals to note the 40 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> on which their text depends. Gregory (Textkritik, II, 634) numbers 2369 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. The most <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> and useful grouping of these <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> is genealogical and geographical. The work of future critics will be to reconstruct the text by reconstructing the various types, Spanish, Italian, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, French, etc. The chief <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are: <ul><li>A, or <em>Cod. Amiatinus</em> (q.v.) (eighth century; at Florence), contains complete Bible; text probably Italian, best extant <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. <li>C, or <em>Cod. Cavensis</em> (ninth century; at La Cava, near <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>), a complete Bible; best representative of Spanish type. <li><em>Delta</em>, or <em>Cod. Dunelmensis</em> (seventh or eighth century; in Durham Cathedral, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>), Gospels; text akin to A. <li>F, or <em>Cod. Fuldensis</em> (A.D. 541-546; at <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>), a complete <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; Gospels are in form of <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian's</a> "Diatessaron". Bishop <a href="../cathen/15414c.htm">Victor of Capua</a> found an Old Latin version of <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian's</a> arrangement and substituted the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> for the Old Latin. <li>G, or <em>Cod. Sangermanensis</em> (ninth century; at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>), contains the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. In Acts, Wordsworth uses it more than any other <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>. <li>H, or <em>Cod. Hubertianus</em> (ninth century; in British Museum, London), a Bible; Theodulfian type. <li><em>theta</em>, or <em>Cod. Theodulfianus</em> (ninth century; at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>), a Bible; Theodulfian type. <li>K, or <em>Cod. Karolinus</em> (ninth century; in British Museum, London), a Bible; <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin's</a> type. See V. <li>O, or <em>Cod. Oxoniensis</em> (seventh century; at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, in Bodl.), contains Gosp.; text English, affected by <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> influences. <li>O2, or <em>Cod. Oxoniensis</em>, or <em>Selden Acts</em> (eighth century; at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, in Bodleian), contains Acts; <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> type. <li>Q, or <em>Cod. Kenanensis</em>, <em>Book of Kells</em> (q.v.) (eighth century; in Trinity College, Dublin), contains Gosp.; <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> type. <li>S, or <em>Cod. Stonyhurstensis</em> (seventh century; at <a href="../cathen/14309b.htm">Stonyhurst College</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>), contains John; text akin to A and probably written near Durham. <li>V, or <em>Cod. Vallicellianus</em> (ninth century; at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in Vallicelliana), a Bible; <a href="../cathen/01276a.htm">Alcuin's</a> type. See K. <li>Y, or <em>Cod. Lindisfarnensis</em> (seventh century; in British Museum, London), Gospels. Liturgical directions in text show it is a copy of a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> written in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>; text akin to A. <li>Z, or <em>Cod. Hareianus</em> (sixth or seventh century; in Brit. Mus., London), contains Epist. and Apoc. </ul>
<h2 id="section5">Syriac manuscripts</h2>
<h3 id="A">Old Syriac (OS)</h3>

<p>The Curetonian and Sinaitic Syriac <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> represent a version older than the Peshitto and bear witness to an earlier text, one closely akin to that of which D and the Old Latin are witnesses. <ul><li>The Curetonian Syriac (Syr-Cur) <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> was discovered in 1842, among <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> brought to the British Museum from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of S. Maria Deipara in the Nitrian <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and was published by Cureton in 1858. It contains five chapters of John, large portions of Matt. and Luke, and <a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs17">Mark 16:17-20</a>, enough to show that the last twelve verses were originally in the document. <li>The Sinaitic Syriac (Syr-Sin) was found by Mrs. Lewis and Mrs. Gibson, during 1892, in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Catherine on <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>. This palimpsest contains the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a> in great part, though not entire; it is an earlier recension of the same version as Syr-Cur. Both are assigned to the fifth century and represent a Syriac version which cannot be later than A.D. 200.</ul>
<h3 id="B">The Diatessaron</h3>

<p>This harmony of the Gospels was written by <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, an Assyrian and the disciple of <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin Martyr</a>, about A.D. 170, and was widely used in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Our <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> records are two Arabic versions, discovered one in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the other in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and published 1888. A Latin translation of an <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> edition of <a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">St. Ephraem's</a> commentary on the Diatessaron is in like manner witness to this early version of the Gospels. Scholars are inclined to make <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian's</a> to be the earliest Syriac translation of the Gospel.
<h3 id="C">The Peshitto</h3>

<p>The earliest <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of this Syriac <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> is a <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> dated A.D. 464; this is the earliest dated Biblical <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>; it is in the British Museum. There are two <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the fifth century. In all, the Peshitto <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> number 125 of Gospels, 58 of Acts and the <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">Catholic Epistles</a>, and 67 of the Pauline Epistles.
<h3 id="D">The Philoxenian Syriac version</h3>

<p>The Philoxenian Syriac version of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> has come down to us only in the four minor <a href="../cathen/03453a.htm">Catholic Epistles</a>, not included in the original Peshitto, and a single <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the Apoc., now at <a href="../cathen/15057a.htm">Trinity College</a>, Dublin.
<h3 id="E">The Harklean Syriac version</h3>

<p>This version of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is represented by some 35 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> dating from the seventh century and later; they show kinship with a text like to D.
<h3 id="F">The Palestinian Syriac version</h3>

<p>This version of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> has reached us by lectionaries and other fragmentary <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> discovered within the past sixteen years. The three principal <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> A.D. 1030, 1104, and 1118.
<h2 id="section6">Armenian manuscripts</h2>

<p>Armenian <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> from A.D. 887, and are numerous.
<h2 id="section7">Coptic manuscripts</h2>
<h3 id="A">Sahidic</h3>

<p>The Apocalypse is the only book of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> which has come down to us complete in a single <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of this dialect of Upper <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Many isolated fragments have of recent years been recovered by excavation in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; from these it may soon be possible to reconstruct the Sahidic <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. The earliest fragments seem to belong to the fifth century. Some of these <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> are bilingual (see T of <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>).
<h3 id="B">Boharic</h3>

<p>This version in the dialect of Lower <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> is well represented by <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the same character as B-<em>aleph</em>. The Curzon Catena is the earliest extant Boh. <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the Gospels; it is dated A.D. 889 and is in the Parham Library. Others are of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. None is at all so old as the Sah. fragments.
<h3 id="C">Middle Egyptian</h3>

<p>Middle <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> fragments on vellum and papyrus, have been found in Fayum and near to Akhmim and to <a href="../cathen/10176a.htm">Memphis</a>. The largest of these fragments is a British Museum sixth-century palimpsest of <a href="../bible/joh003.htm">John 3</a> and <a href="../bible/joh004.htm">4</a>.
