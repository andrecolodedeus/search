<h1>Maphrian</h1>  

<p>The Syriac word <em>mafriano</em> signifies one who fructifies, a consecrator. It is used to designate the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> who holds the second rank after the patriarch among the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobite Syrians</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignity</a> goes back certainly to the seventh century and perhaps to the closing years of the sixth. When the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> at Odessa had been closed, first by Nonnus, successor of Ibas (457), and definitively by the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>, Cyrust (489), <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> triumphed in the Empire of the Sassanides. The few Persian <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, like Xenaias (Philoxenus) of Tahal, were forced to go into exile. Xenaias became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mabug (Hieropolis). In <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, the town of Tagrit alone did not adopt the prevailing religion; it became the centre of the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> missions at the commencement of the sixth century. The energetic James Barad&aelig;us <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> for the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Ahudenuneh, who died a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> in 575. But the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Maruthas were to be <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with greater success. At one time from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Mar Mattai (near Nineveh), at another from Tagrit itself, he undertook fruitful missionary work among the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> and throughout the valley of the Tigris. He relied on the influence of Chosroes II's physician, Gabriel de Shiggar, who had completely won the confidence of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> queen, Shirin.

<p>From time to time the Persian armies, which invaded the Roman territories so often at this period would bring back a multitude of captives, <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptians</a>, Euphratesians or Edessans, mostly <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>. So in 628-9 it was judged suitable to organize the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> Church in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. The Jacobite <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> the Chancellor, saw that it would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to grant the Syrians in the Persian Empire a large <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> autonomy. In fact one of the most serious objections raised by the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> against the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> was that the latter obeyed a spiritual head residing in <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine</a> territory and that they were therefore inclined to become the subjects of the Emperor of Constantinople. Hence the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> were frequently denounced at the Court of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> as conspirators favouring the Romans. The Sassanides would then become incensed and persecute the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>. <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> moreover <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> certain canon which prescribed that the head of the "Oriental" <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, was alone entitled to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> "Oriental" <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and he was aware that these canons dated back to the very beginning of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> churches. He decided that the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of Tagrit, when <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by him, would become autonomous and be sole rulers of the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> churches in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. Maruthas had a dozen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> subject to him. The fall of the Sassanide Empire which soon occurred did not change this arrangement. The <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Tagrit received at a time which cannot be definitely fixed the title of "Mafriano".

<p>The relations of the maphrian and the Jacobite <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> were, despite several <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a>, maintained harmoniously. In 869 it was decided that just as the patriarch <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the maphrian so the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a new patriarch would be reserved to the maphrian. Within their own circumscriptions the maphrians had often disputes with the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Mar Mattai (near Nineveh) who was jealous of the preponderating influence of Tagrit. In 1089 the churches of that town having been destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, the maphrians abandoned it and settled in Mosul. From A.D. 1155 they generally resided at Mar Mattai while retained an immediate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over Tagrit and Nineveh. The only maphrian worthy of being specially mentioned as the celebrated Gregory Abulfaradj, surnamed <a href="../cathen/02294a.htm">Bar Hebraeus</a> (d. 1286), the most highly cultured man of his age. There has been preserved a history by him of his predecessors. This work was continued by his brother, and later by unscholarly <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalists</a>, and stops in the fifteenth century (1496). For a long time past the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobite</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the valley of Tigris have seriously decreased in numbers. The title of maphrian still exists, but the office has lost all its importance and dignity.
