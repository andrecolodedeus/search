<h1>Marc-Antoine Muret</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a>, b. at Muret, near <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, in 1526; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 1585. He studied at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> and was greatly influenced by <a href="../cathen/13506a.htm">Scaliger</a>, whom he twice visited at <a href="../cathen/01209b.htm">Agen</a>. He taught successively at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> (1546), <a href="../cathen/02684a.htm">Bordeaux</a> (1547), and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Becoming intimate with Dorat, Joachim, du Bellay, and the poets of the Pleiad, he published in French a commentary on the "Amours" of <a href="../cathen/13180b.htm">Ronsard</a> (1553) and a collection of Latin verses, the "Juvenilia". His prosperity seemed unclouded, when accusations of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">immorality</a> drove him from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, and thence to <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. At last he settled in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, where he taught for four years (1555-58).

<p>To the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> period of Muret's life belong his editions for Paulus Manutius, of Horace, Terence (1555), Catullus, Tibullus, and Propertius (1558), to which must be added the three orations "De studiis litterarum" (1555). It was at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> that he became connected with <a href="../cathen/08760a.htm">Lambinus</a>. In 1559 Muret published the first eight books of his "Variae lectiones", which occasioned <a href="../cathen/08760a.htm">Lambinus</a> to accuse him of plagiarism and brought their friendship to an end. With the year 1559 began the insecure period of Muret's life, when he devoted himself to private tuition. He next entered the service of Ippolito d'Este, Cardinal of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, in whose suite he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and thence to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he spent the remainder of his life (1563-85) expounding <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Cicero, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, Juvenal, and Tacitus, and teaching <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>. In 1576 he received <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>.

<p>Muret's editions of Latin authors and translations of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, while they hardly entitled him to rank with the great Philologists of his time, show good taste, acumen, and care. As a stylist, he was long esteemed one of the modern masters of Latinity. He succeeded in imitating Cicero rather by a felicitous resemblance between his own temperament and that of his model than by any painfully laborious search for Ciceronian locutions, and he felt compelled to protest against the exaggerations of contemporary Ciceronians. He himself tells of an amusing incident when he purposely employed, in speaking Latin, a word not to be found in Nizolius's Ciceronian Lexicon: some of his hearers exclaimed in horror at the apparent slip, and then, when he showed them the word in Cicero's own text, were equally enthusiastic in their plaudits. His most interesting work "Variae lectiones" (1559, 1580, 1585), contains not only observations on ancient authors, but notes of real value in relation to the history of his own times. Such, for instance, is his account of a conversation with his patron, the Cardinal of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, about <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a>, whose election had put an end to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal's</a> ambitions (XVI, 4). Muret's works were edited by Ruhnken (Leyden, 4 vols., 1789), and another edition appeared at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> (5 vols., 1727-30). Besides the editions of authors above mentioned, we are indebted to him for Cicero's Catalinian Orations (Paris, 1581), the first book of his Tusculan Disputations, his Philippics (Paris, 1562), Seneca's "De providentia", and some notes on Sallust and Tacitus.
