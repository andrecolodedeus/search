<h1>Marcellus of Ancyra</h1>  

<p>One of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present at the Councils of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> and of Nicaea, a strong opponent of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, but in his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to combat Arius adopting the opposite extreme of modified <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Sabellianism</a> and being several times condemned, dying deprived of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> c. A.D. 374. A few years after the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a> Marcellus wrote a book against Asterius, a prominent <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>. In this work he maintained that the trinity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> was but a transitory <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was originally only One Persorality, but at the creation of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> the Word or Logos went out from the Father and was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Activity in the world. This Logos became incarnate in Christ and was thus constituted <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. The Holy Ghost likewise went forth as third Divine Personality from the Father and from Christ according to <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs22">John 20:22</a>. At the consummation of all things, however (<a href="../bible/1co020.htm#vrs28">1 Corinthians 20:28</a>), Christ and the Holy Ghost will return to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> be again an absolute Unity. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> having condemned his works, Marcellus was first deposed at Constantinople in 336 at a council under the presidency of <a href="../cathen/05623b.htm">Eusebius of Nicomedia</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, and Basil of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> appointed to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Marcellus sought redress at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> from <a href="../cathen/08561a.htm">Julius I</a>, who in the autumn of 340 declared Marcellus innocent of the charges brought against him, and reinstated him in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Constantius, when threatened by his brother, allowed the restoration of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, Marcellus and others to their sees in 348. Marcellus' return was resisted by the populace of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>, but he succeeded in occupying his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> for a few years, only to be finally deposed by the Marcedonian faction at Constantinople and succeeded by Basil, c. 353. St. Athanasius himself at last recognized Marcellus' <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heterodoxy</a>; Pope Damascus likewise, in 380, and the Second General Council pronounced against him. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of Caesarea</a> wrote against him two works: "Contra Marcellum", an exposition of Marcellus' <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, and "On the Theology of the Church", a refutation of Marcellus.
