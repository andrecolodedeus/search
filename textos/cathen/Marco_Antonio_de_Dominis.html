<h1>Marco Antonio de Dominis</h1>  

<p>Dalmatian ecclesiastic, <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, and man of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, b. on the island of Arbe, off the coast of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, in 1566; d. in the Castle of Sant&rsquo; Angelo, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, September, 1624. <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> at the Illyrian College at Loreto and at the <a href="../cathen/11387a.htm">University of Padua</a>, he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> and taught mathematics, <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, and rhetoric at Padua and <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>. On leaving the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (1596), he was, through imperial influence, appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Zengg (Segna, Seng) and Modrus in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> (Aug., 1600), and transferred (Nov., 1602) to the <a href="../cathen/14207a.htm">archiepiscopal See of Spalato</a>. He sided with <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, in whose territory his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was situated, during the quarrel between <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> and the Republic (1606-7). That fact, combined with a correspondence with <a href="../cathen/13477b.htm">Fra Paolo Sarpi</a> and conflicts with his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and fellow-bishops which culminated in the loss of an important financial case in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, led to the resignation of his office in favour of a relative and his retirement to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. Threatened by the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, he prepared to <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a>, entered into communication with the English ambassador to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, Sir Henry Wotton, and having been assured of a welcome, left for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1616. On his way there, he published at <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">Heidelberg</a> a violent attack on <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>: "Scogli del Cristiano naufragio", afterwards reprinted in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He was received with open arms by James I, who quartered him upon Archbishop <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, called on the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to pay him a pension, and granted him precedence after the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and York. De Dominis wrote a number of anti-Roman sermons, published his often reprinted chief work, "De Republic&#226; Ecclesiastic&#226; contra Primatum Pap&aelig; (Vol. 1, 1617; vol. II, 1620, London; Vol. III, 1622, <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>), and took part, as assistant, in the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of George Montaigne as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lincoln, 14 Dec., 1617. In that same year, James I made him Dean of <a href="../cathen/15654a.htm">Windsor</a> and granted him the Mastership of the <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>.

<p>In 1619 De Dominis published in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> the first edition of <a href="../cathen/13477b.htm">Fra Paolo Sarpi's</a> "History of the Council of Trent"; the work appeared in Italian, with an anti-Roman title page and letter dedicatory to James I. His vanity, <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, and irascibility, however, soon lost him his English friends; the projected <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> marriage of Prince Charles made him anxious about the security of his position in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and the election of <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> (9 Feb., 1621) furnished him with an occasion of intimating, through <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> diplomatists in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, his wish to return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The king's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> was aroused when De Dominis announced his intention (16 Jan., 1622), and Star-Chamber proceedings for illegal correspondence with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were threatened. Eventually he was allowed to depart, but his chests of hoarded money were seized by the king's men, and only restored in response to a piteous personal appeal to the king. Once out of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> his attacks upon the English Church were as violent as had been those on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">See of Rome</a>, and in "Sui Reditus ex Anglii Consilium" (Paris, 1623) he recanted all he had written in his "Consilium Profectionis" (London, 1616), declaring that he had deliberately lied in all that he had said against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. After a stay of six months in <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he lived on a pension assigned him by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. On the death of <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> (8 July, 1623) the pension ceased, and irritation loosened his tongue. Coming into conflict with the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> he was declared a relapsed <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, was confined to the Castle of Sant&rsquo; Angelo, and there died a natural death. His case was continued after his death, his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> declared manifest, and his body burned together with his works on 21 Dec., 1624.

<p>In 1611 he published, at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> work entitled: "Tractatus de radiis visus et lucis in vitris, perspectivis et iride", in which, according to Newton, he was the first to develop the theory of the rainbow, by drawing attention to the fact that in each raindrop the light undergoes two refractions and an intermediate reflection. His claim to that distinction is, however, disputed in favour of <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a>.
