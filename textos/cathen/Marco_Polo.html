<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Marco Polo</h1>  

<p>Traveller; born at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1254; died there in 1324. His father Nicolo and his uncle Matteo, sons of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> patrician, Andrea Polo, had established a house of business at Constantinople and another at Sudak on the shore of the Black Sea, in the southeast of the Crimea. About 1255 they left Constantinople with a consignment of jewels and after reaching Sudak went to the residence on the banks of the Volga of Barka (Bereke), Mongol Khan of Kiptchak, who welcomed them and paid them well for their wares. But <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> having broken out between Bereke and Hulagu, the Mongol conqueror of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and Bereke having been defeated, the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> were at a loss how to return to their own country. Leaving Kiptchak they continued their journey towards the east, thus reaching Bokhara, where they stayed three years. Envoys from Hulagu to the Great Khan of Tatary passing through the town and finding these "Latins" who spoke the Tatar language induced them to accompany them to the residence of the great khan, which they reached only after a year's journey. Kublai, the great khan, was the most powerful of the descendants of Jenghiz Khan. While his brother Hulagu had received <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Iran</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> Kublai was master of <a href="../cathen/10479b.htm">Mongolia</a>, Northern <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, and Tibet, and was to conquer Southern <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. This intelligent prince endeavoured to maintain intercourse with the West and favoured the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> or <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Hence Nicolo and Matteo Polo were well received by him, he questioned them with regard to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> states, the emperor, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, princes, <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, and their manner of fighting and confided to them letters to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in which he asked for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missionaries.

<p>Accompanied by a Mongol "baron", the two brothers set out in 1266 and after three years of travel reached St.-Jean d'Acre in 1269. There the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, Teobaldo Visconti, informed them that <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a> was dead and they returned to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to await the election of a new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> not having reached a decision at the end of two years the brothers Polo determined to return, but this time they brought with them the youthful Marco, son of Nicolo, then aged eighteen. All three went to Acre to see the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> and request of him letters for the great khan, but they had scarcely left Acre when they learned that this same <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> had been elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> (1 Sept., 1271). Overjoyed, they returned to Acre and the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> gave them letters and appointed two <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a> to accompany them. But while going through <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, they fell amid troops of the <a href="../cathen/09578c.htm">Mameluke</a> Sultan Bibara the Arbelester, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> refused to go further, and the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> continued their journey alone. It was only after three years and a half that, after having escaped all kinds of dangers, they reached the dwelling of Kublai, who received them probably at Yen King near the present Peking (1275). The great khan was delighted to see them once more; they presented him with the letters from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and some oil from the lamp at the Holy Sepulchre.

<p>Kublai conceived a great affection for the youthful Marco Polo, who readily adopted the Tatar custom and soon learned the four languages as well as the four writings of which they made use (probably Mongolian, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a>, Persian, and Uighur). The great khan sent him on a mission six months' journey from his residence (probably to Annam) and the information he brought back with regard to the countries he traversed confirmed him in the good will of the sovereign. For three years he was governor of the city of Yang-chow (Janguy), on which twenty-seven cities were dependent. The question of his share in the siege of Siang-y&#226;ng and the engines of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> constructed under his supervision are much more <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. According to Chinese historians the reduction of this city took place in 1273, prior to Marco Polo's arrival in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>; on the other hand the details which he gives concerning Kublai's expedition against the Kingdom of Mien (Burma, 1282) leave it to be supposed that he participated therein. He was also charged with several missions to the Indian seas, <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>, and Cochin China. At last after having journeyed through almost the whole of Western <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, the three <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> obtained, but not without difficulty, the great khan's permission to return to their own country. They set sail with a fleet of fourteen four-masted ships and were charged with the escort of an imperial princess <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to Arghun, Khan of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. After a perilous voyage through the Sonda Strait and the Indian Ocean, they landed at Ormuz and after having delivered the princess to the son of the lately deceased Arghun they continued their journey by land as far as Trebizond, where they took ship for Constantinople, finally reaching <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1295 after an absence of twenty-four years.

<p>In costume and appearance they resembled Tatars; they had almost forgotten their native tongue and had much difficulty in making themselves recognized by their friends. Their wealth speedily aroused admiration, but their marvellous accounts were suspected of exaggeration. Marco, who was constantly talking of the great khan's millions, was nicknamed "Messer Millioni" and in the sixteenth century their dwelling was still called the "Corte de millioni". War having broken out between <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, Marco Polo was placed in command of a galley (1296), but the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> fleet having been destroyed in the Gulf of Lajazzo he was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. There he became associated with Rusticiano of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, an adapter of French romances, who wrote down at his dictation the account of his travels. On his release from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> Marco Polo became a member of the Great Council of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and lived there till his death.

<p>The "Book of Marco Polo" dictated to Rusticiano was compiled in French. A more correct version, revised by Marco Polo, was sent by him in 1307 to Thibaud of Cepoy, the agent of Charles of Valois at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, to be presented to that prince, who was a candidate for the Crown of Constantinople and the promoter of a crusading movement. The Latin, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> versions are merely translations which are often faulty, or abridgments of the first two texts. The compilation of his book may be regarded as one of the most important events in the history of geographical discoveries. Hitherto Occidentals <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> almost nothing of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>; in his "Tresor" Brunetto Latini (1230-94) merely reproduces in this respect the compilations of C. Julius Solinus, the abbreviator of Pliny. The "Book of Marco Polo", on the other hand, contains an exact description by an intelligent and well-informed witness of all the countries of the Far East. It is characterized by the exactness and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">veracity</a> of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> statesmen, whose <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> accustomed them to secure information with regard to various nations and to estimate their resources. This <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> character extends even to the tone, which modern taste finds almost too impersonal. The author rarely appears on the scene and it is regrettable that he did not give more ample details concerning the missions with which he was charged by the great khan. Otherwise nothing could be more lifelike than the pictures and descriptions which adorn the account, and the na&#239;vete of the old French enhances their literary charm.

<p>In a prologue the author briefly relates the first journey of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and uncle, their return to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, their second journey, their sojourn with the great khan, and their final return. The remainder of the work, which, in the editions is divided into three books, comprises the description of all the countries through which Marco Polo travelled or concerning which he was able to secure information. The first book treats hither <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, Turcomania, <a href="../cathen/06460a.htm">Georgia</a>, the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/10598b.htm">Mossul</a>, the Caliphate of <a href="../cathen/02202c.htm">Bagdad</a>, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, Beluchistan, etc. Curious details are given concerning the City of <a href="../cathen/02202c.htm">Bagdad</a> and the fate of the last caliph, who died of hunger amid his treasures, and concerning the Old Man of the Mountain and his Assassins. He mentions the recollections in Bactria of Alexander the Great, whom the kings of the country regarded as their ancestor. Subsequently he describes Kashmir and the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">deserts</a> of the plateau of <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> Kush and Chinese Turkestan, "Great Turkey" and its capital, Kashgar. He mentions the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> communities of Samarkand and after crossing the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Gobi reaches Karakoram, the old Mongol capital, which affords him the opportunity for an important digression regarding the origin and customs of the Tatars. Book II introduces us to the Court of Kublai Khan and we are given most curious information with regard to his capital, Kambalik (Peking), his magnificence, and the organization of his Government. We are shown with what facility the Mongols adopted Chinese etiquette and civilization. Then follows a description of the provinces of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, first of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> north of Hwang-ho or Cathay, where there were stones which burned like wood (coal), then Si-ngan-fu, the ancient capital of Th&#226;ng (Shen-si), <a href="../cathen/14718a.htm">Tibet</a>, into which he penetrated a distance of five days' walk, Sunnan, the Kingdom of Mien (Burma), Bengal, Annam, and Southeast <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>.

<p>At the beginning of Book III he relates the great maritime expedition which Kublai Khan attempted against Zipangu (Japan) and which ended in defeat. Then he enters the Indian seas and describes the great island of Java and that of the lesser Java (Sumatra), <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>, in connection with which he speaks of the <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhists</a> and their reformer "Sagamoni Borcam" (Khakamouni). From here he goes to the coast of "Maabar" (Coromandel) and gives a full description of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. He mentions the existence of the island of Socotra and the large island of Madagascar, in connection with which he speaks of the regular currents of the Strait of Mozambique and relates the legend of the Roc, the fabulous bird of the voyages of Sinbad the Sailor. He concludes with information concerning Zanzibar, the people of the coast of Zanguebar, <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>, the Province of Aden, and the northern regions where the sun disappears for a period of the year. The "Book of Marco Polo" was soon translated into all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> languages and exercised an important influence on the geographical discoveries of the fifteenth century. <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Christopher Columbus</a> had read it attentively and it was to reach the western route to the lands described by Marco Polo that he undertook the expedition which resulted in the discovery of America.

<p>Eighty-five <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the book showing rather important differences are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. They may be ranged into four types: (1) <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Bib. Nat., <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Tr. 1116, edited by the Societ&eacute; de G&eacute;ographie in 1824; it is regarded as the original <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of Rusticiano of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, at least as its exact copy. (2) Bib. Nat., <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> Tr. 2810. Under the name of "Libre des merveilles du monde" it is a collection of accounts of the Orient compiled in 1351 by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/09142b.htm">Jean Lelong</a> of Ypres and copied at the end of the fourteenth century for Philip the Bold, Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. It contains the text of Marco Polo according to the copy sent to Thibaud of Cepoy and is enriched with numerous miniatures. To the same <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> belong <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> Tr. of the Bib. Nat. 5631, 5649 and the Berne <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> (Bib, canton. 125). (3) Latin version executed in the fourteenth century by Francesco Pipino, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> of Bologna, according to an Italian copy. The Latin version published by Gryn&aelig;us at Basle in 1532 in the "Novus orbis" is indirectly derived from this version. (4) Italian version prepared for printing by Giovanni Ramusio and published in the second volume of his "Navigazioni e viaggi" (3 vols. fol., Venice, 1539). Chief editions.&mdash;There are more than fifty-six of these in various languages. French text, ed. Pauthier (Paris, 1865); Italian version, ed. Baldelli (Florence, 1827); English tr. with commentary by Sir Henry Yule, revised by Henri Cordier (London, 1903).
