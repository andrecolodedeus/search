<h1>Marcosians</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinian Gnostics</a>, founded by <a href="../cathen/09650b.htm">Marcus</a> and combated at length by <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (Haer. I, xii-xxiii). In the district of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, the Rhone Valley and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, they continued to exist till well into the fourth century. They maintained their <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> system not merely in theory but, forming <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> communities, they were addicted to <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> practices. In their conventicles prophecy was habitually practiced; not only men but <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were bidden by their leaders or by lot to stand up in the congregation and prophesy. The incoherent gibberish they uttered was taken for the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Women</a> were likewise bidden to utter the Eucharistic formula over the elements. The wine was then poured in a larger cup and by a chemical trick increased in volume. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> scornfully repeats that the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> was an affair of silly <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, ruining their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and their bodies, and narrates that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who repented and returned to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> confessed their past degradation.

<p>The Marcosian system was a degraded variety of that of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>. It retained the 30 <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a>, but called them "Greatnesses" and gave them numerical values. It kept the myth of the fall of Sophia but called it a "Divine Deficiency". Peculiar to it was the adaptation of the Pythagorean number theory to <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a>. The 30 <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> are obtained by adding the numbers of the Ogdoad together: 1+2+3+4+5+7+8 = 30. The 6 is purposely omitted for it is the <em>episemon</em> and not a letter of the usual Greek alphabet. The fall of Sophia is clearly shown by the fact that <em>Lambda</em> which equals 30, or the complete set of Greatnesses, is really only the eleventh letter of the alphabet, but to make up for this deficiency it sought a consort and so became M (= <em>Lambda Lambda</em>). The <em>episemon</em>, or 6, is a number full of potency; the name <em>Iesous</em> consists of six letters, hence the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>. When the Propator, who is the <em>Monas</em>, willed the Unspeakable to be spoken, He uttered the Word which has 4 syllables and 30 letters. The plenitude of Greatness is 2 tetrads, a decad and a dodecad (4+4+10+12 = 30); the 2 tetrads are the Unspeakable, Silence, Father and Truth followed by Logos, Life, Man and Church. These form the Ogdoad. The mutes of the Greek alphabet belong to Father and Truth (The Unspeakable, and Silence, of course, do not count); these being mute reveal nothing to man. The semivowels belong to Word and Life, but the vowels to Man and Church, for through Man voice gave power to all. The 7 Greek vowels go through the seven heavens, which thus sing the Great Doxology in harmony. Even numbers are <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a>, odd numbers male, by the union of the first of these, 2 3, was begotten the episemon, or 6, the number of our Salvation. G. Salmon well remarks that Marcus's system is the most worthless of all that passed under the name of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in second century literature. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (1. c) is practically our only authority. (See <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">GNOSTICISM</a>.)
