<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus</h1>  

<p>Roman Emperor, A.D. 161-180, born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 26 April, 121; died 17 March, 180.
<h2>His early life (121-161)</h2>

<p>His father died while Marcus was yet a boy, and he was <a href="../cathen/01147b.htm">adopted</a> by his grandfather, Annius Verus. In the first pages of his "Meditations" (I, i-xvii) he has left us an account, unique in antiquity, of his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> by near relatives and by tutors of distinction; diligence, gratitude and hardiness seem to have been its chief characteristics. From his earliest years he enjoyed the friendship and patronage on the <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Emperor Hadrian</a>, who bestowed on him the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the equestrian order when he was only six years old, made him a member of the Salian <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> at eight, and compelled <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus Pius</a> immediately after his own adoption to adopt as sons and heirs both the young Marcus and Ceionius <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Commodus</a>, known later as the Emperor Lucius Verus. In <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of his adopted father he changed his name from M. Julius Aurelius Verus to M. Aurelius Antoninus. By the will of <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Hadrian</a> he espoused Faustina, the daughter of <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus Pius</a>. He was raised to the consularship in 140, and in 147 received the "tribunician power".
<h2>His reign (161-180)</h2>
<h3>His co-reign with Lucius Verus (161-169)</h3>

<p>In all the later years of the life of <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus Pius</a>, Marcus was his constant companion and adviser. On the death of the former (7 March, 161) Marcus was immediately acknowledged as emperor by the Senate. Acting entirely on his own initiative he at once promoted his adopted brother Lucius Verus to the position of colleague, with equal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as emperor.

<p>With the accession of Marcus, the great <em>Pax Romana</em> that made the era of the Antonines the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiest</a> in the annals of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and perhaps of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, came to an end, and with his reign the glory of the old <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> vanished. Younger peoples, untainted by the vices of civilization, and knowing nothing of the inanition which comes from over-refinement and over-indulgence, were preparing to struggle for the lead in the direction of human destiny. Marcus was scarcely seated on the throne when the Picts commenced to threaten in Britain the recently erected Wall of <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus</a>. The Chatti and Chauci attempted to cross the Rhine and the upper reaches of the Danube. These attacks were easily repelled.

<p>Not so with the outbreak in the Orient, which commenced in 161 and did not cease until 166. The destruction of an entire legion (XXII <em>Deiotariana</em>) at Elegeia aroused the emperors to the gravity of the situation. Lucius Verus took the command of the troops in 162 and, through the valor and skill of his lieutenants in a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> known officially as the <em>Bellum Armeniacum el Parthicum</em>, waged over the wide area of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Cappadocia, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, Mesopotamia, and <a href="../cathen/10117a.htm">Media</a>, was able to celebrate a glorious triumph in 166. For a people so long accustomed to peace as the Romans were, this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was wellnigh fatal. It taxed all their resources, and the withdrawal of the legions from the Danubian frontier gave an opportunity to the Teutonic tribes to penetrate into the rich and tempting territory. People with strange-sounding names &#151; the Marcomanni, Varistae, Hermanduri, Quadis, Suevi, Jazyges, <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> &#151; collected along the Danube, crossed the frontiers, and became the advance-guard of the great migration known as the "Wandering of the Nations", which four centuries later culminated in the overthrow of the Western Empire. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against these invaders commenced in 167, and in a short time had assumed such threatening proportions as to demand the presence of both emperors at the front.
<h3>After the death of Lucius Verus (169-180)</h3>

<p>Lucius Verus died in 169, and Marcus was left to carry on the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> alone. His difficulties were immeasurably increased by the devastation wrought by the plague carried westward by the returning legions of Verus, by famine and earthquakes, and by inundations which destroyed the vast granaries of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and their contents. In the panic and terror caused by these events the people resorted to the extremes of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> to win back the favour of the <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> through whose <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> it was believed these visitations were inflicted. Strange rites of expiation and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> were resorted to, victims were stain by thousands, and the assistance of the gods of the Orient sought for as well as that of the gods of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.
<h3>The Thundering Legion incident (174)</h3>

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Quadi in 174 there took place the famous incident of the <a href="../cathen/14711b.htm">Thundering Legion</a> (<em>Legio Fulminatrix, Fulminea, Fulminata</em>) which has been a cause of frequent controversy between <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">non-Christian</a> writers. The Roman army was surrounded by enemies with no chance of escape, when a storm burst. The rain poured down in refreshing showers on the Romans, while the enemy were scattered with lightning and hail. The parched and famishing Romans received the saving drops first on their faces and parched throats, and afterwards in their helmets and shields, to refresh their horses. Marcus obtained a glorious victory as a result of this extraordinary event, and his enemies were hopelessly overthrown.

<p>That such an event did really happen is attested both by <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers. The former attribute the occurrence either to magic (Dion Cassius, LXXI, 8-10) or to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the emperor (Capitolinus, "Vita Marci", XXIV; Themistius, "Orat. XV ad Theod"; Claudian, "De Sext. Cons. Hon.", V, 340 sqq.; "Sibyl. Orac.", ed. Alezandre, XII, 196 sqq. Cf. Bellori, "La Colonne Antonine", and <a href="../cathen/05274b.htm">Eckhel</a>, "Doctrina Nummorum", III, 64). The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers attributed the fact to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who were in the army (Claudius Apollinaris in <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.5</a>; <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "Apol.", v; ad Seap. c. iv), and soon there grew up a legend to the effect that in consequence of this <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> the emperor put a stop to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (cf. Euseb. and Tert. opp cit.). It must be conceded that the testimony of Claudius Apollinaris (see Smith and Wace, "Dict. of Christ. Biogr.", I, 132-133) is the most valuable of all that we possess, as he wrote within a few years of the event, and that all credit must be given to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, though it does not necessarily follow that we should accept the elaborate detail of the story as given by <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and later writers [Allard, op. cit. infra, pp. 377, 378; Renan, "Marc-Aur&egrave;le" (6th ed., Pari, 1891), XVII, pp. 273-278; P. de Smedt, "Principes de la critique hist." (1883) p. 133].


<h3>His death (180)</h3>

<p>The last years of the reign of Marcus were saddened by the appearance of a usurper, Avidius Cassius, in the Orient, and by the consciousness that the empire was to fall into unworthy hands when his son <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Commodus</a> should come to the throne. Marcus died at Vindobona or <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> in Pannonia. The chief authorities for his life are Julius Capitolinus, "Vita Marci Antonini Philosophi" (SS. Hist. Aug. IV); Dion Cassius, "Epitome of Xiphilinos"; Herodian; Fronto, "Epistolae" and Aulus Gellius "Noctes Atticae".
<h2>Assessment</h2>
<h3>General assessment</h3>

<p>Marcus Aurelius was one of the best men of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> antiquity. Apropos of the Antonines the judicious <a href="../cathen/10536a.htm">Montesquieu</a> says that, if we set aside for a moment the contemplation of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> verities, we can not read the life of this emperor without a softening feeling of emotion. Niebuhr calls him the noblest character of his time, and M. Martha, the historian of the Roman <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moralists</a>, says that in Marcus Aurelius "the philosophy of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Heathendom</a> grows less proud, draws nearer to a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> which it ignored or which it despised, and is ready to fling itself into the arms of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Unknown God</a>." On the other hand, the warm eulogies which many writers have heaped on Marcus Aurelius as a ruler and as a man seem excessive and overdrawn. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the most marked trait in his character was his devotion to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and letters, but it was a curse to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> that "he was a <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> first and then a ruler". His dilettanteism rendered him utterly unfitted for the practical affairs of a large empire in a time of stress. He was more concerned with realizing in his own life (to say the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, a stainless one) the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> ideal of perfection, than he was with the pressing <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office.

<p><a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">Philosophy</a> became a disease in his mind and cut him off from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of practical life. He was steeped in the grossest <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>; he surrounded himself with charlatans and magicians, and took with seriousness even the knavery of <a href="../cathen/01297a.htm">Alexander of Abonoteichos</a>. The highest offices in the empire were sometimes conferred on his philosophic teachers, whose lectures he attended even after he became emperor. In the midst of the Parthian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> he found time to keep a kind of private diary, his famous "Meditations", or twelve short books of detached thoughts and sentences in which he gave over to posterity the results of a rigorous self-examination. With the exception of a few letters discovered among the works of Fronto (M. Corn. Frontonis Reliquiae, Berlin, 1816) this history of his inner life is the only work which we have from his pen. The style is utterly without merit and distinction, apparently a matter of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> for he tells us he had learned to abstain from rhetoric, and poetry, and fine writing. Though a <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> deeply rooted in the principles developed by Seneca and Epictetus, Aurelius cannot be said to have any consistent system of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. It might be said, perhaps, in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to this "seeker after righteousness", that his faults were the faults of his philosophy rooted in the principle that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> naturally inclined towards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and needed to be constantly kept in check. Only once does he refer to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> (Medit., XI, iii), a spiritual regenerative force that was visibly increasing its activity, and then only to brand the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> with the reproach of obstinacy (<em>parataxis</em>), the highest social crime in the eyes of Roman authority. He seems also (ibid.) to look on <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Christian martyrdom</a> as devoid of the serenity and calm that should accompany the death of the wise man. For the possible relations of the emperor with <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Christian bishops</a> see A<font size=-2>BERCIUS OF</font> H<font size=-2>IEROPOLIS</font>, and <a href="../cathen/10166b.htm">M<font size=-2>ELITO OF</font> S<font size=-2>ARDES</font></a>.
<h3>His dealings with the Christians</h3>

<p>In his dealings with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> Marcus Aurelius went a step farther than any of his predecessors. Throughout the reigns of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Hadrian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus Pius</a>, the procedure followed by Roman authorities in their treatment of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was that outlined in <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan's</a> <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> to Pliny, by which it was ordered that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> should not be sought out; if brought before the courts, legal <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their guilt should be forthcoming. [For the much-disputed <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> "Ad conventum Asiae" (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.13</a>), see <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">A<font size=-2>NTONINUS</font> P<font size=-2>IUS</font></a>]. It is clear that during the reign of Aurelius the comparative leniency of the legislation of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> gave way to a more severe temper. In <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Southern Gaul</a>, at least, an imperial rescript inaugurated an entirely new and much more violent era of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.1.45</a>). In <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> and in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> the blood of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> flowed in torrents (Allard, op. cit. infra. pp. 375, 376, 388, 389). In general the recrudescence of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> seems to have come immediately through the local action of the provincial governors impelled by the insane outcries of terrified and demoralized city mobs. If any general imperial edict was issued, it has not survived. It seems more probable that the "new decrees" mentioned by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.21.5</a>) were local ordinances of municipal authorities or provincial governors; as to the emperor, he maintained against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> the existing legislation, though it has been argued that the imperial edict (Digests XLVIII, xxix, 30) against those who terrify by <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> "the fickle minds of men" was directed against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Duchesne says (Hist. Ancienne de l'&Eacute;glise, Paris, 1906 p. 210) that for such obscure <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> the emperor would not condescend to interfere with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the empire. It is clear, however, from the scattered references in contemporary writings (<a href="../cathen/03490a.htm">Celsus</a> in <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../fathers/04168.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> VIII</a>; Melito, in Eusebius, <a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.26</a>; <a href="../cathen/02042b.htm">Athenagoras</a>, <a href="../fathers/0205.htm"><em>A Plea for the Christians</em> 1</a>) that throughout the empire an active pursuit of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was now undertaken. In order to encourage their numerous enemies, the ban was raised from the <em><a href="../cathen/04691b.htm">delatores</a></em>, or "denouncers", and they were promised rewards for all cases of successful conviction. The impulse given by this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a> to an unrelenting pursuit of the followers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> rendered their condition so precarious that many changes in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization and discipline date, at least in embryo, from this reign.

<p>Another significant fact, pointing to the growing numbers and influence of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and the increasing distrust on the part of the imperial authorities and the cultured classes, is that an active literary propaganda, emanating from the imperial surrounding, was commenced at this period. The <a href="../cathen/04582a.htm">Cynic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Crescens took part in a public disputation with <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Fronto, the precepter and bosom friend of Marcus Aurelius, denounced the followers of the new religion in a formal discourse (Min. Felix, "Octavius", cc. ix, xxxi) and the satirist Lucian of <a href="../cathen/13422a.htm">Samosata</a> turned the shafts of his wit against them, as a party of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> fanatics. No better <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> the tone of the period and of the widespread <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and practices which prevailed among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> is needed than the contemporary "True Word" of <a href="../cathen/03490a.htm">Celsus</a> (see <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">O<font size=-2>RIGEN</font></a>), a work in which were collected all the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> malice and all the arguments, set forth with the skill of the trained rhetorician, which the philosophy and experience of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> world could muster against the new creed. The earnestness and frequency with which the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> replied to these assaults by the <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetic</a> works (see <a href="../cathen/02042b.htm">A<font size=-2>THENAGORAS</font></a>, <a href="../cathen/10336a.htm">M<font size=-2>INUCIUS</font> F<font size=-2>ELIX</font></a>, <a href="../cathen/14625a.htm">T<font size=-2>HEOPHILUS OF</font> A<font size=-2>NTIOCH</font></a>) addressed directly to the emperors themselves, or to the people at large, show how keenly alive they were to the dangers arising from these literary or academic foes.

<p>From such and so many causes it is not surprising that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> blood flowed freely in all parts of the empire. The excited populace saw in the misery and bloodshed of the period a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the gods were angered by the toleration accorded to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, consequently, they threw on the latter all blame for the incredible public calamities. Whether it was famine or pestilence, drought or floods, the cry was the same (<a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "Apologeticum", V, xli): <em>Christianos ad leonem</em> (Throw the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to the lion). The pages of the Apologists show how frequently the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were condemned and what penalties they had to endure, and these vague and general references are confirmed by some contemporary "Acta" of unquestionable authority, in which the harrowing scenes are described in all their gruesome details. Among them are the "Acta" of <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> and his companions who suffered at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (c. 165), of Carpus, Papylus, and Agathonica, who were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/13609b.htm">Scillitan Martyrs</a> in Numidia, and the touching Letters of the Churches of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and Vienne (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.1-4</a>) in which is contained the description of the tortures inflicted (177) on <a href="../cathen/02594a.htm">Blandina</a> and her companions at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. Incidentally, this document throws much light on the character and extent of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Southern Gaul</a>, and on the share of the emperor therein.
