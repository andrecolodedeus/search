<h1>Marcus Aurelius Maxentius</h1>  

<p>Roman Emperor 306-12, son of the <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Emperor Maximinianus</a> Herculius and son-in-law of the chief Emperor Galerius. After his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> abdication he lived in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as a private citizen; but when Galerius established in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the new poll and land taxes decreed by <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> he was elected (28 October, 306) rival emperor. Maxentius owed his elevation not to personal merit but to the senators and pretorians who, because of the unusual measures of the emperor, feared lest they should lose their privileged position. Maxentius's adherents then summoned his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> from Campania to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; and the young ruler invested him with the purple as co-regent. Thus the Roman empire had six rulers. Severus, the Augustus of the West, received a commission from Galerius to expel the youthful usurper from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; but when he reached the capital, part of his army deserted to their old commander, <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximian</a>. Severus with a few followers escaped to <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> so as to maintain military relations with Galerius. He then made terms with <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximian</a> and surrendered to him, expecting honourable treatment, but he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> soon afterwards and, Galerius approaching from <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a> with an army, he was forced to commit <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a>. Alarmed at Galerius's intervention, <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximian</a> on behalf of Maxentius, negotiated with Constantine to whom he gave his daughter Fausta as bride. Meanwhile Galerius with his Illyrian legions pushed forward to the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but finding that he was unable to occupy it or any of the fortified places, he withdrew his forces. At his suggestion a conference of all the C&aelig;sars took place at Carnuntum on the Danube (306) in which the prestige of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> had great influence. Maxentius retained his imperial dignity. Though it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that soon after this he put an end to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and Africa, his reign was stained with acts of debauchery and cruelty.

<p>After his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> death, Maxentius and Maximin, Emperor of the East, fearing the political alliance of Constantine and Licinius, came to an understanding unfriendly to Constantine. Maxentius made extensive military preparations, and destroyed the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of Constantine. Constantine advanced over what is now Mont Cenis with a comparatively small but well-drilled army and, victorious in several battles, occupied Upper <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; he then marched against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where his opponent, strongly entrenched behind the Tiber and the walls of Aurelius, hoped to resist him successfully. Thoughtlessly and shortsightedly, Maxentius, abandoning this excellent position, made a bridge of boats across the Tiber (near the Milvian Bridge, now Ponte Molle), and awaited the troops of Constantine on the right bank of the river. It was then that occurred the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> related by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (Vita Constant. I, 28-30), that when Constantine implored <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> aid, a fiery cross appeared over the sun with the legend: <em>to&uacute;to n&#237;ka</em> (conquer with this). Further, he had been advised by Christ, in a dream the previous night, to go into battle armed with this sign. Maxentius's soldiers were thrown into confusion by the impetuosity of the Gallic horsemen, and in the efforts of the retreating masses to escape over the narrow bridge, many were thrown into the river and drowned, among them Maxentius (28 October, 312). His son and counsellors were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, but his officials and dependents retained their positions.
