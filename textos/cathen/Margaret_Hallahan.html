<h1>Margaret Hallahan</h1>  

<p>Foundress of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Congregation of <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a> (third order); b. in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 23 January, 1803; d. 10 May, 1868. The <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of this remarkable, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> were poor and lowly <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who died when Margaret, their only child was nine years old. She was sent to an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> at Somers Town for two years, and then at the age of eleven went out to service, in which state of life she remained for nearly thirty years. In 1826 she accompanied the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in which she was living to <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>; there she tried her vocation as a lay sister in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the English Augustinian <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, but only remained there a week, feeling sure <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had other work for her. She became a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> tertiary in 1842, and then came to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, proceeding to Coventry where she worked under <a href="../cathen/15121a.htm">Dr. Ullathorne</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, among the factory girls. Presently she was joined by others, and with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> fathers formed a community of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> tertiaries, who were to devote themselves to active <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>. The rule of the Third <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>, being intended for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> living in the world, was not suited to community life; she therefore drew up, from the rule of the first and second orders, constitutions which she adapted to her own needs. The first professions were made on the feast of the Immaculate Conception, 1845. From Coventry the community moved to <a href="../cathen/02790b.htm">Bristol</a>, where several <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were placed under their charge, from there they went to Longton, the last of the pottery towns in Stafford-shire, where a large field of labour was opened to them.

<p>In 1851 her congregation received <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>, and in 1852 the foundation stone of St. Dominic's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was laid at Stone, also in Stafford-shire, but not in the Black Country: this became the mother house and <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, and to it the Longton community afterwards moved. This stone <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at one time enjoyed the reputation of numbering some of the cleverest <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> its subjects, of whom the late mother provincial, <a href="../cathen/05153b.htm">Theodosia Drane</a>, was one. At Stone a church and a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for incurables were built; this latter was one of Mother Margaret's dearest schemes, and was begun on a small scale at <a href="../cathen/02790b.htm">Bristol</a>. In 1857 she opened another <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Stoke-on-Trent, a few miles from Stone, and the same year founded an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> at the latter place. In 1858 she went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to obtain the final confirmation of her constitutions, which was granted, and the congregation was placed under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the master general of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, who appoints a delegate, generally the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, to set for him. New foundations were made at Bow, and at Marychurch, Torquay, before her death. She was a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of great gifts both natural and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, she had marvellous <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and wonderful determination. She refused to accept government aid for any of her <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, or to place them under government inspection, but since her death her congregation has followed the custom of the country in these respects.
