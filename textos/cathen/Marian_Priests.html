<h1>Marian Priests</h1>  

<p>This term is applied to those <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who being <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in or before the reign of <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> (1553-1558), survived into the reign of Elizabeth. The expression is used in contradistinction to "Seminary Priests" by which was meant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, or other <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> abroad. Shortly after Elizabeth's accession ordinations ceased altogether in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of the surviving <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and unless the Seminary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had begun to land in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to take the place of the older <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who were dying off, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> would have become extinct in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. There was an important distinction between the Marian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the Seminary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the fact that the penal legislation of the rigorous statute 27 Eliz. c. 2 only applied to the latter who were forbidden to come into or remain in the realm under pain of high treason. Therefore the Marian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> only came under the earlier <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, e.g. 1 Elizabeth c. 1 which inflicted penalties on all who maintained the spiritual or <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority of any foreign <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, or 5 Eliz. c. 1 which made it high treason to maintain the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>, or to refuse the Oath of Supremacy. The recent researches of Dom Norbert Birt have shown that the number of Marian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who were driven from their livings was far greater than has been commonly supposed. After a careful study of all available sources of information he estimates the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> holding livings in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> at Elizabeth's accession at 7500 (p. 162). A large number, forming the majority of these, accepted, though unwillingly, the new state of things, and according to tradition many of them were in the habit of celebrating Mass early, and of reading the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> service later on Sunday morning. But the number of Marian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who refused to conform was very large, and the frequently repeated statement that only two hundred of them refused the Oath of Supremacy has been shown to be misleading, as this figure was given originally in Sander's list, which only included dignitaries and was not exhaustive. Dom Norbert Birt has collected instances of nearly two thousand <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who were deprived or who abandoned their livings for <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience'</a> sake. As years went on, death thinned the ranks of these faithful <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but as late as 1596 there were nearly fifty of them still working on the English mission. Owing to their more favourable legal position they escaped the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> endured by the Seminary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and only one&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/02411a.htm">Venerable James Bell</a>&mdash;is known to have suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.
