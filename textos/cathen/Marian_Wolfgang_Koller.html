<h1>Marian Wolfgang Koller</h1>  

<p>Scientist and educator, b. at Feistritz in Carniola, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, 31 October, 1792; d. of cholera at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 19 September, 1866. His <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was very thorough; after studying the rudiments at Feistritz he went to <a href="../cathen/08743a.htm">Laibach</a>, where he spent nine years (1802-11) in classical, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> studies, and completed his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> life by a course in higher mathematics at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. From 1814 to 1816 he acted as private tutor in a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> at Steinbach, and whilst here he was so attracted by the life and work of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of <a href="../cathen/08701a.htm">Kremsm&uuml;nster</a> that he finally entered their <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> on 5 October, 1816, taking the name Marian in place of his <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">baptismal name</a> of Wolfgang. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 18 August, 1821, and after three years of very successful work in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Sippachzell he was recalled to Kremsm&uuml;nster to teach natural history and <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physics</a>. In 1830 he was relieved of the professorship of natural history and appointed director of the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> observatory, and during the next seventeen years by his indefatigable labours not only preserved but increased the high repute of the observatory throughout <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. He continued also to teach physics until 1839, when he was given general charge of the student body. His administrative abilities were so great as to attract the attention of the authorities at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> whither he was called in 1847. From this time on he was employed in high offices either in the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a> or in the Department of Education, which was at that time undergoing a process of reconstruction. All matters pertaining to the <em>Realschulen</em>, and to the polytechnic, nautical, and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> institutions, were placed under his immediate care, and, as a mark of appreciation for his share in the thorough organization of the <em>Realschulen</em>, the emperor bestowed on him the Cross of the Order of Leopold on 27 May, 1859. In 1848 he was elected member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, and always took a very active part in its proceedings. He was also an active writer, and contributed to various scientific periodicals many articles on <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, physics and meteorology. To his high <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> abilities was added the charm of a genial character, and he thus won not only the esteem but also the affection of those with whom he came into personal contact. His principal work is the "Berechnung der periodischen Naturerscheinungen", published in the "Wiener Denkschrift" (1850).
