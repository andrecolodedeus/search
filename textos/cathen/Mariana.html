<h1>Mariana</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> of Mariana (Marianensis).

<p>Mariana, situated in the centre of Minas Geraes, the great mining state of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, is bounded on the north, south and west respectively by its suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>, <a href="../cathen/04772a.htm">Diamantina</a>, Pouso Alegre, <a href="../cathen/06687a.htm">Goyaz</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15115d.htm">Uberaba</a>. The city of Mariana, formerly Ribeir&atilde;o do Carmo (population over 6000), established in 1711, lies about seven miles east of Ouro Preto, the former capital of the state. A <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was erected there in December, 1745, by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, the first occupant of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> being Frei Manoel da Cruz (1745-1764), who was translated from the Diocese of Maranh&atilde;o. For over a century Mariana was the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> centre of Minas Geraes. In 1854 some <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were detached from it to form part of the new <a href="../cathen/04772a.htm">Diocese of Diamantina</a>, and others in 1900 on the establishment of that of Pouso Alegre. In May, 1906, Mariana was made an archdiocese, having previously been a suffragan of Rio de Janeiro. It embraces an area of 110,000 square miles, nearly one-half of Minas Geraes, and contains over 2,000,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> there being only about 2000 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, mostly foreigners in the Mining centres. It has 311 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 611 churches or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, served by 545 secular and 104 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> is under the care of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>. The present occupant of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> who is the ninth ordinary of Mariana and the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Mgr. Silverio Gomes Pimenta, was born at Congonhas do Campo, near the celebrated shrine of Mattosinhos, on 12 January, 1840; he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> on 20 July, 1862, at Sabar&aacute;, by Bishop Vi&ccedil;oso, and for many years professed history and philosophy in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; named coadjutor to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mariana, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13465d.htm">S&atilde;o Paulo</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Rio de Janeiro on 31 August, 1890, as Titular <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03204c.htm">Camachus</a> in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. On 16 April, 1897, he succeeded to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> on the death of Mgr. Corr&ecirc;a de S&aacute; y Benevides. Mgr. Pimento is the first native of Minas Geraes to rule this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, all his predecessors except Mgr. Benevides, having been Portuguese by birth.

<p>From 1711 till 1897 the capital of the state was at Ouro Preto near Mariana, but it has now been transferred to the new and rapidly growing city of Bello Horizonte, founded in February, 1894. It is situated on the west side of the valley of the Rio das Velhas, and lies 390 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro. It has a population of about 17,615, of whom 17,490 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. It has five churches, and a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in charge of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> for the higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. A large <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is being erected there. Many <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> distinguished in <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and literature are natives of or have laboured in the Diocese of Mariana. Among them may be mentioned the following priests: Jos&eacute; Basilio da Gama (1740-95), the author of the epic "Uruguay", a work which unfortunately pays no tribute to the labours of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, of which body da Gama was a member before the suppression; Jos&eacute; da Santa Rita Dur&atilde;o (1737-83), a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> born in Infec&ccedil;aoado, Minas Geraes, a brilliant novelist and author of the famous poem "Caramur&uacute;"; Felix Lisboa, the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>; Jos&eacute; Mariano da Concec&ccedil;&atilde;o Velloso (1742-1811), the great botanist, author of "Flora Fluminese"; Jos&eacute; Corr&ecirc;a de Almeida, b. 4 September, 1820, at Barbacena; d. there, 5 April, 1905, poet (23 volumes published) and historian; Bishop de Sousa. Of Diamantina, author of "O Lar Catholico" and other works well known in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, is also a native of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.
