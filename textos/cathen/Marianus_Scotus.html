<h1>Marianus Scotus</h1>  

<p>There were two Irish scholars of this name who attained distinction in the eleventh century. Both spent the greater part of their lives in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Marianus Scotus (the Chronicler)</h2>

<p>Marianus Scotus the chronicler, whose <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> name was Maelbrigte, or "Servant of Brigid"; born, according to his own "Chronicle", in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in 1028; died at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, 1082. From the same source we learn also that in 1052 he became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, assuming the name Marianus, and that in 1056 he went to <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, where he entered the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Martin. Two years later, he tells us, he went to <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, visited <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, and in 1059 was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>. In 1060 he became a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a>, at <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, whence in 1070 he moved to <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in obedience to an order from his former <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Siegfried, who was now <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. His remains were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Martin at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>. The only work which can with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> be ascribed to Marianus is the "Universal Chronicle" (the <em>incipit</em> has the title "Mariana Scoti cronica clara"), a history of the world, year by year, from the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era down to 1082. It has been published in various editions, the best of which are the Waitz edition in the "Monumenta Germani&aelig;" (V, 481 sqq.) and <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne's</a> (P.L., CLXVII, 623 sqq.). It exists in at least two eleventh-century <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, one of which (Vatican, 830) has strong claims to be considered an autograph. The material which Marianus gathered together with a great deal of intelligent industry was used very freely by subsequent chroniclers, such as <a href="../cathen/06114a.htm">Florence of Worcester</a> and <a href="../cathen/13783c.htm">Siegbert of Gembloux</a>. The chronological system, however, which Marianus defended as preferable, and which was based on his contention that the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> birth given by <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a> was twenty-two years too late, did not meet with general acceptance. He himself gives both systems. Besides the "Chronicle" several other works were ascribed to Marianus owing to a confusion of his name with that of his countryman, Marianus, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Peter's at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Marianus Scotus (the Abbot)</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Peter's at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, born in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> before the middle of the eleventh century; died at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> towards the end of the eleventh century, probably in 1088. In 1067 he left his native country, intending to make a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Like many of his countrymen, however, who visited the Continent, he decided to settle in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and did not return to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. At Bamberg he became a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and thence he went with some companions to <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> (or Regensburg), where he founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Peter and became its first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. After his death he was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> being observed on 17 April, 4 July, or, according to the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, on 9 February. Marianus devoted himself to transcribing and glossing the text of the Scriptures. His success as a scribe, and the exceptional beauty of his calligraphy may be judged by a specimen of his work which has come down to us. This is Codex 1247 of the Imperial Library of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> containing the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> with glosses, some of which are in Latin and others in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>. The latter were collected and published by <a href="../cathen/15757c.htm">Zeuss</a> in his "Grammatica Celtica" (p. xxiv). The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> ends with the words "In honore individu&aelig; trinitatis Marianus Scotus scripsit hunc librum suis fratribus peregrinis . . ." (the date given is 16 May, 1078). Over the words 'Marianus Scotus" is the gloss: "Muirdach trog macc robartaig, i.e. Marianus miser filius Robartaci." The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> form of his name was, therefore, Muirdach (from the root <em>muir;</em> hence, instead of the Latin form Marianus, there sometimes occurs Pelagius), and his family name was Robartaig, or Rafferty.
