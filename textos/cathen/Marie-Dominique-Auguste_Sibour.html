<h1>Marie-Dominique-Auguste Sibour</h1>  

<p>Born at Saint-Paul-Trois-Chateaux (Drome, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>), 4 August, 1792; died in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 3 January, 1857. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1818, he was assigned to the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Archdiocese of Paris</a>. He was named canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a> in 1822, became favorably known as a preacher, and contributed to "L'Avenir". In 1837, during a vacancy, he was chosen administrator of the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a>, and two years later was raised to the episcopal <a href="../cathen/04793a.htm">See of Digne</a>. His administration was marked by his encouragement of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies, a practical desire to increase the importance of the functions exercised by his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, and a faithful observance of canonical forms in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> trials. The same principles actuated him in his rule of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Archdiocese of Paris</a>, to which he was called largely because of his prompt adhesion to the new government after the Revolution of 1848. He held in 1849 a provincial council in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and in 1850 a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod. In 1853 he officiated at the marriage of <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a>, who had named him senator the previous year. Although in his answer to <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> he declared the definition of the Immaculate Conception inopportune, he was present at the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> and shortly afterwards solemnly published it in his own diocese. The benevolent co-operation of the imperial government enabled him to provide for the needs of the poor churches in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and to organize several new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. He also aimed at introducing the <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and was progressing favorably in this direction when he was killed by an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdicted</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> named Verger.
