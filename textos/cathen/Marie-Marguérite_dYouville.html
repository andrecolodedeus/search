<h1>Marie-Margu&eacute;rite d'Youville</h1>  

<p>(<em>n&eacute;e</em> Dufrost de Lajemmerais).

<p>Foundress of the Gray Nuns, or Sisters of Charity, born at Varennes, near <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, 15 October, 1701, of Christophe-D. de L. and Renee de Varennes, the sister of <a href="../cathen/09050b.htm">Laverendrye</a>, discoverer of the Rocky Mountains; d. 23 December, 1771. After studying two years with the <a href="../cathen/15229a.htm">Ursulines at Quebec</a>, she shared, at the age of twelve, in the housework of her <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowed</a> mother. She married (1722) M. d'Youville, who treated her with indifference, and eight years later left her a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> with three children and a heavy <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>. She was forced to carry on a small trade in order to meet her <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>. The only two of her sons who reached manhood became <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Out of her own poverty, she helped the needy. Mother d'Youville conceived an ardent devotion to the Eternal Father, which was to be the keynote of her life. Providence destined her to rescue from <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> and ruin the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, founded (1694) by M. Charon, ad hitherto managed by a brotherhood bearing his name. This undertaking which was to be the cradle and groundwork of a new religious institute, the <a href="../cathen/07031a.htm">Grey Nuns</a>, or Sisters of Charity, was destined to flourish under the wise and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> direction of Mother d'Youville. When, in 1747, the General Hospital was entrusted to her, she had already, with a few companions living under a provisional rule, begun practicing the spiritual and corporal works of mercy. She opened the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> to disabled soldiers, the aged of either sex, the insane, the incurable, foundlings, and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. When, to save the General Hospital of Quebec, the intendant Bigot, with Bishop Pontbriand's assent, decided to transfer to the former institution the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> Hospital, Mother d'Youville submitted. The intervention of the Sulpician superior, Cousturier, maintained her <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. In 1755, Mgr. Pontbriand confirmed the rule of the institute drawn up by Father Normant. Mother d'Youville assumed the entire <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, 49,000 <em>livres</em>, and to meet the expense of restoring, rebuilding, and harbouring numerous inmates, increased by the admission of epileptics, <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, and contagious patients excluded from the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu, she made clothing for the king's stores and for the traders of the upper country, which constituted her chief revenue. During the Seven Years War so many English soldiers were treated at the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, that one of its wards was called "la salle des Anglais". Mother d'Youville ransomed from the Indians, at a great price, an <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> destined to torture, and saved from their fury several fugitives, one of whom, through gratitude, later prevented the bombardment of the fortress-like <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. Owing to the exorbitant cost of necessaries of life, due to unscrupulous corruption, the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> was heavily indebted at the time of the conquest. A credit of 100,000 <em>livres</em>, due by the French Government, was redeemed with interest only under Louis XVIII, and the sum applied to the work begun by the foundress. Despite her poverty, Mother d'Youville undertook to rescue all foundlings thrown upon her charity. When, in 1766, the General Hospital was destroyed by fire, fully resigned to her loss, she <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">knelt</a> with her sisters and recited the "Te Deum". Her institute has spread throughout <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and even to some of the neighbouring states. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> introducing the cause of her <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a>, and entitling her to be called Venerable, was signed on 28 April, 1890.
