<h1>Marie Lataste</h1>  

<p>Born at Mimbaste near <a href="../cathen/16032b.htm">Dax</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 21 February, 1822; died at <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a>, 10 May, 1847; was the youngest child of simple <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> peasants. According to her own narrative, written under obedience, she was poor, lowly, country girl, knowing nothing but what her mother taught her; hence, in the natural order, all her learning consisted in being able to read, write, sew, and spin. Her <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a> long embraced merely the principal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Little by little the light grew like a vast furnace on which wood is cast, and towards which a mighty wind blows from all sides. The <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, the Light of the World, had been the light of her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. He had brought her up as a mother does her child, with patience and perseverance; if she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> aught she owed it to Him, she had all from Him. A troublesome child, proud, ambitious, and self-contained, she was the constant subject of her mother's anxious <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and her first Communion, made in her twelfth year, was the turning point in her life. A strong impression of the Divine presence on the great day, and confirmation received soon after, strengthened her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and virtue, which thenceforward never faltered. About a year after Marie saw at Mass, during the <a href="../cathen/05380b.htm">Elevation</a>, a bright light which seemed to inflame her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the Eucharistic Lord and to increase as that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> increased. Soon, to prepare her for greater favours, she was cast into the crucible of severe interior trials and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, whence docility to her director brought her forth victorious. He allowed her to make a yearly <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of virginity, and the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> became the central thought of her life. According to her own narrative, towards the end of 1839, when she was seventeen, she saw Christ on the altar. On the Epiphany, 1840, this was repeated, and for three whole years every time she assisted at Mass this grace was granted her. Almost daily she received from the lips of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> instructions forming a complete spiritual and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. He explained in simple language the principal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; sometimes he showed her symbolical visions, or taught her in parables. He sent His Mother and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to her; at times He reproached and humbled her. Her progress in virtue was rapid, her defects disappeared, and she exercised a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> influence on those who approached her. She did not suspect at first that hers was a singular privilege, yet she never mentioned it except to her confessor.

<p>In 1840 M. l'Abb&eacute; Pierre Darbins succeeded M. Farbos as cur&eacute; of Mimbaste. By Divine command Marie revealed her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to him. Much surprised, he tested his penitent by trying her obedience and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>; he found her wholly submissive. Then he asked the help of the director of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/16032b.htm">Dax</a>. They agreed to order her to put in writing everything <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> she had heard and seen in the past, and all she might hear and see in the future. In due time this was accomplished; but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> text has been so much interpolated by the editor that the "Works of Marie Lataste" are not considered authentic. The Divine Master had made known to her His will, that she should embrace <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, and in the Society of the Sacred heart, recently founded and wholly unknown to her and her director. After many objections and delays, she obtained permission and left for <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 21 April, 1844, alone, under the guidance of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>. She was received at the H&ocirc;tel Biron by Madame de Boisbaudry, who had her examined by an experienced spiritual guide. She was admitted as lay sister on 15 May. With great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> she entered upon this new life. Humility, charity, <a href="../cathen/11182a.htm">obedience</a>, and fidelity to common life were her chief characteristics. Her sisters' testimony was: Sister Lataste does everything like every one else, yet no one does anything like her." Still a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> she was sent to <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a>, in the hope that change of air would improve her health. An active life succeeded the quiet of the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">noviceship</a>; she was infirmarian, refectorian, portress, but her <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> virtues shown the more brilliantly; children, strangers, as well as her superiors and her sisters, felt her hidden <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. Marie's <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> had been postponed in the hope of an improvement in her health. But on Sunday, 9 May, she became suddenly so very ill that the end seemed near. She was allowed to pronounce her <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, just before receiving the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Then the pent-up ardours of her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> burst forth in ecstatic <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> until her death on 10 May, 1847, at the age of twenty-five. Her memory lives in benediction. Her remains have been secured from <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a> and now repose at Roehampton near London.
