<h1>Marienberg</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> abbey of the Congregation of St. Joseph near Mals, Tyrol (in Vintschau). The history of the founding goes back to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, who established between 780 and 786 a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near Taufers (Tuberis) in Graub&uuml;nden (in Upper Vintschau), which later (after 880) was dissolved and then became a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> for both sexes. Two hundred years later there was a reorganization: Eberhard of Tarasp built for the male portion the little <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Schuls in the Engadine, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Cardinal Gregor in 1078 or 1079, while the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> inmates remained at Taufers (later called M&uuml;nster). Destroyed by lightning, Schuls was rebuilt, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1131. Ulrich IV of Tarasp shortly after called <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from Ottobeuern to Schuls to instill new life into the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which till then had been merely a <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>, was made an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. In 1146 he removed the community to St. Stephen in Vintschgau, and in 1150 to the hill near the village of Burgeis, where the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> has since continued under the name of Marienberg. Ulrich himself later assumed the habit of the order (about 1164) in Marienberg, and died on 14 December, 1177. Under Abbot Konrad III (1271-98) Marienberg was sacked by two nobles, and in 1304 Abbot Hermann was killed by Ulrich of Matsch. In 1348 the plague carried away every inmate of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> except Abbot Wyho, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, one <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a>, and Goswin, later a chronicler. Goswin became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1349, and compiled new choir-books, two estate registers (<em>Urbare</em>), and the chronicle of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The chronicle, most of which Goswin had finished in 1374, is divided into three books, the first of which gives the story of the founding and donations, the second the history of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and the third the privileges conferred by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and princes. It gives an account, without regard for order or <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a>, of the founders, fortunes, benefactors, and oppressors of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Documents take up the greater part, and the narrative is poor. Under Abbot Nicholas (1362-88) Goswin became prior, while in 1374 he was appointed court <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Duke Leopold III of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. In 1418 Marienberg was burned down. After a period of decline in the sixteenth century, Abbot Mathias Lang (1615-40), from Weingarten <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, became the reformer of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. In 1634 Marienberg joined the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Congregation of Swabia. Lang's successor, Jacob Grafinger (1640-53), enlarged the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, and made the younger members finish their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of repute. In 1656 the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was again burned down. Abbot Johann Baptist Murr (1705-32) founded in 1724 the gymnasium at Meran, still administered by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Marienberg. Abbot Pacidus Zobel (1782-1815) compiled a chronicle of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>. In 1807 Marienberg was dissolved by the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> government, but was again restored by Emperor Francis II in 1816. In the nineteenth century the following well-known scholars were <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Marienberg: <ul><li>(1) Beda Weber (1798-1858), from 1849 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>-priest in Frankfort and canon of <a href="../cathen/09260a.htm">Limburg</a>, not as historian, homilist, gifted poet, and energetic <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; member of the Academy in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>; <li>(2) Albert J&auml;ger (1801-91), professor of history at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>, gymnasium director at Meran, from 1851 professor in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and member of the Academy; <li>(3) <a href="../cathen/15760b.htm">Pius Zingerle</a> (1801-81), professor in Meran, in 1862 professor at the Sapienza in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, later <em>scriptor</em> of the Vatican <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, and the greatest authority on Syrian literature.</ul>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> has now 52 members (40 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>). Apart from the gymnasium at Meran it has the care of four <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>.
