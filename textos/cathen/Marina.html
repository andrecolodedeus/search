<p>(DE MARINIS)

<p>The name of an ancient and noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Republic of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, distinguished alike in the Island of Chios, one of its dependencies, where it possessed many beautiful and valuable estates. Besides giving to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> one <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/15218a.htm">Urban VII</a>, it adorned the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> with several eminent <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and distinguished religious.
<h2 id="section1">Leonardo Marini</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, born 1509 on the island of <a href="../cathen/03689b.htm">Chios</a>, in the &AElig;gean Sea; died 11 June, 1573, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He entered the order in his native place, and, after his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>, made his studies in the Convent of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> with great distinction, obtaining finally the degree of Master of Sacred Theology. He was a man of deep spirituality, and was esteemed the most eloquent of contemporary orators and preachers. <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, recognizing his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and extraordinary executive ability, decided to choose him as coadjutor with the right of succession to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, but death frustrated his plans. On 5 March, 1550, <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a> created him <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> and administrator of the <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Diocese of Mantua</a>. In 1553 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> to the court of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V of Spain</a>, where, by his fearless defence of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, he effected a complete adjustment of the religious troubles of the country. On 26 Feb., 1562, <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> elevated him to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of Lanciano, and the same year, at the request of <a href="../cathen/06635a.htm">Cardinal Hercules Gonzaga</a>, appointed him <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, in all the deliberations of which he took a prominent part. On the termination of the council, after visiting his archdiocese, he was sent to the court of Maximilian II to adjust certain <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, and, on his return, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> determined to raise him to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, but death prevented him from carrying out his plans. Marini now resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and retired to the castle of his brother to combat by pen and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the reformers. <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>, however, not slow in recognizing his brilliant talents, appointed him to the See of Alba and made him Apostolic Visitor of twenty-five <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the anxiety of the pontiff to carry into effect the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> reforms. In 1572 he was sent by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> on a mission to <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a> and Sebastian of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> to secure from these monarchs a renewal of their alliance against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. His mission was successful. He returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to be elevated to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, but died two days after his return. By order of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, Marini, with the assistance of two of his brethren, Egidio Foscarari and Francesco Foreiro, composed the famous <a href="../cathen/13120c.htm">Roman Catechism</a>, "Catechismus Romanus vulgo dictus ex decreto Concilii Tridentini compositus et Pii V jussu editus" (Rome, 1566). He was also a member of the commission of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> appointed by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> to prepare a new and improved edition of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> (1568) and of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> (1570). By order of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> he revised also the Rules and Constitutions of the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabite Order</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Tommaso Marini</h2>

<p>Grand-nephew of the foregoing, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; died 1635 at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. He was of an exceptionally religious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, of which three sons entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a> and four daughters took the religious habit. Tommaso, the eldest made his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and studies in the Minerva <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1608 he was made master of sacred <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, and was assigned the chair of that <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> in his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. He was secretary at three general chapters of the order. In 1611 he became <strong>socius</strong> to the general with the title of Provincial of the Holy Land. In 1615 and 1622 he was definitor at the chapters of Bologna and <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> respectively, and in 1618 was appointed visitor for the German and <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a>, and in 1634 for the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a>, provinces. In 1623 and 1624 he was vicar of the Roman provinces, in which he succeeded in introducing a severer discipline.
<h2 id="section3">Giovanni Baptista Marini</h2>

<p>Brother of the foregoing, born 28 Nov., 1597, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; died there, 6 May, 1669. He entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican order</a> at the age of sixteen, and, after his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>, studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of Salamanca and Alcal&aacute;. On the completion of these he returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, taught <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the Minerva <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, obtained the degree of Master of Theology, and was appointed by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> in 1628 secretary of the Congregation of the Index. In the long conscientious management of this office he received not a little abuse from censured authors, being especially <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the learned but bitter opponent of the Index, <a href="../cathen/12672c.htm">Theophilus Raynaud, S.J.</a>, who, in the pseudonymous work "De immunitate Cyriacorum (<em>sc</em>. the Dominicans) a censura diatribae Petri a Valleclausa", published a pungent satire replete with personal invectives against the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, the alleged controlling element of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> and the Index, but principally against the secretary of the latter. The work was condemned on 20 June, 1662. On 17 Nov., 1664, a similar fate befell two works published by <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> in reply to <a href="../cathen/12672c.htm">Raynaud</a> and in defence of themselves, the Index, and its secretary. The first of these was that of Vincent Baron, "Apologia pro sacra Congregatione Indicis ejusque secretario ac Dominicanis" (Rome, 1662), the other that of John Casalas, "Candor lilii seu Ordo FF. Pr&aelig;dicatorum a calumniis et contumeliis Petri a Valleclausa vindicatus" (Paris, 1664). During his office as secretary he provided for the publication of "Index librorum prohibitorum cum decretis omnibus a S. Congregatione emanatis post indicem Clementis VIII". In 1650 he was elected general of the order, which office he held till his death. At the request of <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>, he composed also a "Tractatus de Conceptione B. M. Virginis", which still remains unpublished.
<h2 id="section4">Domenico Marini</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a> and brother of the two preceding, born 21 Oct., 1599, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; died 20 June, 1669, at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. On 2 Feb., 1615, he followed his two brothers into the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican order</a>, where he soon became noted for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and learning. Having finished his academic studies in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he was sent for his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of Salamanca and Alcal&aacute;. On his return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he was assigned the chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the Minerva <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, but, learning that a severer discipline prevailed in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, he went there, taught <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> for some time, and was then appointed to teach the same in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Honor&eacute; at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Recalled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the general, Nicolao Ridolphi, he was made master of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and <em>regens primarius</em> of studies in his former <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. Later he became prior, and in that capacity demolished the old, and in its place erected the present Minerva <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. On 18 Oct., 1648, <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> created him <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. His attention here was first directed towards providing the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> &mdash; which, since the return of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, had practically lost all significance &mdash; with a representative <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty. From his private funds he founded chairs of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and supplied them with professors of his own order thus restoring to the institution the teachings of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Aquinas</a>. He is the author of "Expositio commentaria in I, II et III partem S. Thom&aelig;" (Lyons, 1663-5).
