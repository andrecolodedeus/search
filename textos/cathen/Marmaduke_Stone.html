<h1>Marmaduke Stone</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, b. at Draycot, 28 Nov., 1748; d. at St. Helens, 22 Aug., 1834. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13365c.htm">St. Omers</a>, shared in its historic exodus to <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, 10-17 August, 1762 (see <a href="../cathen/13365c.htm">S<font size=-2>AINT</font> O<font size=-2>MER,</font> C<font size=-2>OLLEGE OF</font></a>), entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in 1767, later became a master at the Li&#232;ge Academy. In 1790 he succeeded as president to Father William Strickland, who then became <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> at <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>; with his assistance Father Stone succeeded in peacefully guiding the English ex-Jesuits through more than a score of tempestuous years (see <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">M<font size=-2>ILNER,</font> J<font size=-2>OHN</font></a>; <a href="../cathen/12330b.htm">P<font size=-2>OYNTER,</font> W<font size=-2>ILLIAM</font></a>). Father Stone's confr&#232;res, though held together by a common vocation and their still uncancelled <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, were not allowed by the brief of suppression to reunite for purposes of government. He could therefore only rule by appealing to <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; no easy task when one remembers the exterior difficulties, the adventuresome ardour that animated the young men of his college staff, and the peculiar ways into which the middle-aged missionaries were prone to subside. When dealing with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, he could claim no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, not even those essential to religious bodies. Fortunately, they were not hostile, though their views on <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and privileges caused Father Stone much trouble.

<p>On 14 July, 1794, the College at Li&#232;ge was transferred to <a href="../cathen/14309b.htm">Stonyhurst</a>. In spite of the magnitude of the task, it was accomplished in good order; and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> reopened 22 October following. A <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> from <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> (14 Feb., 1796) confirmed Stonyhurst in all the privileges of Li&#232;ge. Though it was impossible to hope for a restoration of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolutionary</a> and <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, it was not impracticable to work for a reunion with the Russian <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, whose corporate existence had lately been recognized at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In this Father Stone was successful. On 19 May, 1803, having made his profession, he was declared provincial, and admitted others to their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>; on 29 September a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> was opened at Hodder. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, however, gave no public recognition of the restored order, though the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> privately expressed his pleasure. When the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of Restoration finally came (7 August, 1814), the interpretation was added (2 Dec., 1816), that it was to apply only where the secular government wished; in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were to be regarded as still in their old position (see <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">S<font size=-2>OCIETY OF</font> J<font size=-2>ESUS</font></a>). The <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> had grown enormously since its transfer to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missions had prospered steadily. Father Stone, notwithstanding his years, continued to act as college minister till 1827, when he finally retired to St. Helens. Here the good news reached him (1829) that the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had at last been formally recognized. Though he might not look an ideal leader, Father Stone was wonderfully adapted to his circumstances; his unfailing kindness, simplicity, sincerity, patience, and self-devotion were irresistible. If he acted slowly, he made no mistakes; he was capable of undertaking great enterprises, and of carrying them through with strong tenacity of purpose.
