<h1>Marquis de Louis-Joseph Montcalm-Gozon</h1>  

<p>A French general, born 28 Feb., 1712, at Candiac, of Louis-Daniel and Marie-Th&eacute;r&egrave;se de Lauris; died at Quebec 14 Sept., 1759. He was descended from Gozon, Grand Master of Rhodes of legendary fame, The warlike spirit of his ancestors had given rise to the saying: "War is the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the Montcalms." Though less clever than a younger brother, a prodigy of learning at seven, Louis-Joseph was a classical scholar. A soldier at fifteen, he spent his leisures in camp reading Greek and German. He served successively at the sieges of Kehl and Philipsbourg, and became a <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> of St. Louis (1741) after a campaign in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, and was appointed colonel of the Auxerrois regiment (1743). He received five wounds at the battle of <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>. In 1736 he had married Ang&eacute;lique-Louise Talon de Boulay, grand-niece of the famous intendant of that name. Of this union were born ten children. In 1755 he succeeded the ill-fated Dieskau, in the command of the French army in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, under <a href="../cathen/15311a.htm">Governor Vaudreuil</a>. The dissonance of character between the two chiefs was to cause much friction during this trying period. Unlike his superior, Montcalm was quick in conception, fearless, generous and impulsive, self-reliant and decisive in action. Intendant Bigot's unscrupulous dishonesty, the apathy of the French court for the "few arpents of snow", an impoverished colony, an ill-fed, ill-clad and badly provided army, all this enhances Montcalm's heroic <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and faithfulness to <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. He was ably seconded by the skilful, prudent and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> chevalier de L&eacute;vis. The disproportion in numbers and resources between the belligerent forces rendered more arduous the problem to be solved. Yet it was only after a record of three brilliant victories that he was to end his glorious career on the Plains of Abraham. First in order of time comes the capture of Chouaguen (Oswego), an undertaking wherein all the odds were against the besiegers. Overcoming all diffidence, Montcalm succeeded (14 Aug., 1756), thereby winning the region of <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a> to the domination of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and with a few badly armed troops taking 1600 <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, 5 flags, 100 guns, at the cost of only 30 killed and wounded. Attributing his success to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he raised a cross with the inscription: "In hoc signo vincunt." In connexion with a later triumph, the capture of Fort William Henry (9 Aug., 1757), Montcalm has been accused of tolerating the massacre by the Indians of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>. Yet, even Bancroft admits that he exposed himself to death to stop the savages infuriated by the rum given them by the English contrary to his orders. The last and greatest of Montcalm's victories, shared by L&eacute;vis and Bourlamaque, was at Carillon (Ticonderoga), a battle which was to result either in the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> or destruction of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>. Although a first encounter (5 July, 1758) had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> disastrous to the French, the death of the valiant young Lord Howe, the real head of the English troops, deprived Abercromby of his chief support. On the 8th the onslaught of the entire <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">Anglo</a>-<a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">American</a> army was rendered impossible by the earthworks and complicated barricade of felled trees protecting Fort Carillon; while a deadly fire decimated the assailants. When the fray was over 2000 English soldiers lay killed or wounded, while the French losses were only 104 killed and 248 wounded; 3800 men had repulsed 15,000. In thanksgiving to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God of Hosts</a>, Montca&igrave;m raised a cross with an inscription.

<p>After arresting the invasion by land, Montcalm had to face the attack of the naval forces. During the siege of Quebec by Wolfe, Montcalm with L&eacute;vis won a first victory at Montmorency Falls, with a loss of 450 to the English (31 July, 1759). But the final act was drawing nigh, which was to seal the fate of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>. On 13 Sept. the enemy stealthily scaled the Heights of Abraham, and at early morn was ranged in battle. Montcalm, thunderstruck by the unexpected tidings, hurried from Beauport and arrayed his troops. Though about equal in numbers, they were doomed to defeat for several reasons, including surprise, hardship, privation, fatigue, and a disadvantageous position. Both generals fell, Wolfe dying on the battle-field, and Montcalm the next morning. This battle, considered in its results, was one of the greatest events of the eighteenth century. It saved <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> from the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> and heralded the dawn of American Independence. Montcalm was a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> and generous commander, a high-minded and disinterested patriot; a faithful <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> giving to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the glory of his victories. His memory is cherished in the Old and the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>. In <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> he shares the honours awarded to his victor, as the following inscription on their joint monument testifies: &mdash;

<blockquote><p>Mortem virtus <br>Communem famam historia <br>Monumentum posteritas dedit.</p></blockquote>

<p>&mdash;a tribute duly anticipated by the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a> in the last words of the hero's epitaph in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>:&mdash;

<blockquote><p>Galli lugentes deposuerunt et generos&aelig; hostium fidei commendarunt.</p></blockquote>

<p>(The French mourned and buried him and commended him to the enemies' generosity).
