<h1>Marseilles (Massilia)</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of Marseilles (Massiliensis), suffragan of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, comprises the district of Marseilles in the Department of Bouches-du-Rh&ocirc;ne. Founded about 600 B.C. by a colony of <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenicians</a> and taken by C&aelig;sar in 49 B.C., Marseilles was captured by the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigoths</a> in A.D. 480; later it belonged to the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>, afterwards, from 507-537, to the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoth</a> <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> and his successors. In 537 it was ceded to the Franks under Childebert and annexed to the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Later the city was divided between Sigebert of Austrasia and Gontran of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. It had various masters until Boson became of King of Burgundy-Provence (879). The Marseilles of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> owed allegiance to three sovereignties. The episcopal town, for which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> fealty only to the emperor, included the harbour of La Joliette, the fisherman's district, and three citadels (Ch&acirc;teau Babon, Roquebarbe, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> palace). The lower town belonged to the viscounts and became a republic in 1214; and the abbatial town, dependent on the Abbey of St. Victor, comprised a few market towns and ch&acirc;teaux south of the harbour. In 1246 Marseilles was subjugated by Charles of Anjou, County of Provence. Finally, in 1481 it was annexed by Louis XI to the crown of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.
<h2>Bishops of Marseilles</h2>

<p>Mgr Duchesne has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the traditions which make St. Lazarus the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Marseilles do not antedate the thirteenth century. A document of the eleventh century relative to the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Victor by <a href="../cathen/02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a> (1040) mentions the existence of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Lazarus at Marseilles but does not speak of him as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In the twelfth century it was believed at <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a> that St. Lazarus was buried in their <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/10727b.htm">St. Nazarius</a>; that St. Lazarus had been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Marseilles was yet unknown. The earliest Proven&ccedil;al text in which St. Lazarus is mentioned as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Marseilles is a passage of the "Otia Imperialia" of <a href="../cathen/06536c.htm">Gervase of Tilbury</a>, dating from 1212. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, however, was certainly preached at Marseilles at a very early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. The city was always a great commercial entrep&ocirc;t, and must have been for Provence what <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> was for Celtic Gaul, a centre from which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> radiated widely. The Christian Museum at Marseilles possesses among other sarcophagi one <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from 273. The epitaph of Volusianus and Fortunatus, two <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who perished by fire, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> perhaps, is one of the oldest <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">Christian inscriptions</a> (Le Blant, "Inscriptions chr&eacute;tiennes de la Gaule", Paris, 1856-65). The first historically known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Oresius who attended the <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> in 314. Proculus (381-428) was celebrated for his quarrel with Patrocles, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles, as to the limits of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and his difference with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province of Narbonnensis Secunda concerning the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> which Marseilles claimed over that entire region; the Council of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, about the year 400, theoretically decided in favour of Narbonne against Marseilles, but allowed Proculus to exercise <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> until his death. In 418 <a href="../cathen/15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a>, influenced by Patrocles of Arles, was about to depose Proculus, but Zosimus died and the matter was dropped. To Bishop Venerius (431-452) we owe the so-called "Marseilles <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>". The <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> question the existence of St. Cannat, and the <a href="../cathen/06350c.htm">"Gallia Christiana"</a> does not count him among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Alban's maintains his existence, trusting the eightieth chapter of the "De viris ill." of <a href="../cathen/06417a.htm">Gennadius</a>, written towards the close of the sixth century; relying also on the veneration certainly paid to him at Marseilles since 1122, Alban's accepts him as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> about 485.

<p>Among the noteworthy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (following the <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> of Abb&eacute; Alban's) are: Honoratus I (about 495) an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writer, approved by Pope Gelasius; St. Theodore (566-91), urged by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> to use only persuasion with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by King Gontran; St. Serenus (596-601) reproved by the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for removing from the churches and destroying certain pictures which the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were inclined to worship; St. Abdalong (eighth century); St. Maurontius (780), former <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Victor; Honoratus II (948-976), who began the restoration of the Abbey of St. Victor; Pons II (1008-73); Pierre de Montlaur (1214-29), who founded in 1214 the first <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde; Cardinal William Sudre (1361-66), afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, commissioned in 1368 by <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a> to crown the empress, wife of Charles IV, and in 1369 to receive the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Johannes Pal&aelig;ologus, Emperor of Constantinople; Cardinal Philippe de Cabassole (1366-68), protector of <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a>, author of a "Life of St. Mary Magdalen", protector of <a href="../cathen/04701a.htm">St. Delphine</a>, governor under <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a> of the Comtat Venaissin, 1367-69: he died in 1372, while <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; the preacher and <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> writer Antoine* Dufour (1506-09), confessor of Louis XII; Claude Seyssel (1509-1517), ambassador of Louis XII at the Lateran Council, 1513; Cardinal Innocent Cib&ograve; (1517-1530), grandson of <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>, nephew of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> and <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>; the preacher and controversialist <a href="../cathen/04091a.htm">Nicolas Co&euml;ffeteau</a>, 1621-23; the Oratorian Eustace Gault (1639-40) and his brother Jean-Baptiste Gault (1642-43) famed for his charity to the galley slaves;  deForbin-Janson (1668-79), sent by <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> to the Diet of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (1674) which elected <a href="../cathen/14061c.htm">John Sobieski</a>. <a href="../cathen/02425c.htm">Belsunce de Castelmoron</a> (1710-55); <a href="../cathen/02418a.htm">Jean-Baptiste de Belloy</a> (1755-1801), died almost a centenarian as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; <a href="../cathen/10094a.htm">Eug&egrave;ne de Mazenod</a> (1837-61) who founded the Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>; Patrice Cruice (1861-65), of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> descent, founder and director of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of higher <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies established at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in the former <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> (Carmes), and well known for his excellent edition of the so-called "Philosophoumena" (see HIPPOLYTUS). The moralist Guillaume du Vair, president of the Parlement of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, was named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Marseilles in 1603 by Henry IV, but the Provincial Estates entreated the king to retain him as head of the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.


<h2>Abbey of St. Victor</h2>

<p>About 415, <a href="../cathen/03404a.htm">Cassian</a> founded the two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of St. Victor, one for men, the other for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of St. Victor lay formerly the remains of Cassian, also those of Saints Maurice, Marcellinus, and Peter, the body of one of the <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Holy Innocents</a>, and Bishop St. Mauront. The biography of St. Izarn, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Victor in the eleventh century (Acta SS., 24 Sept.), gives an interesting account of the first visit of St. Izarn to the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>. All that now remains of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> is the Church of St. Victor dedicated by <a href="../cathen/02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a> in 1040 and rebuilt in 1200. In the fifth century the <a href="../cathen/13703a.htm">Semipelagian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, that began with certain writings of Cassian, disturbed greatly the Abbey of St. Victor and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Marseilles (see <a href="../cathen/03404a.htm">CASSIAN</a>; <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">AUGUSTINE</a>; HILARY; PROSPER OF AQUITAINE); from Marseilles the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> Hilary and <a href="../cathen/12487a.htm">St. Prosper of Aquitaine</a> begged St. Augustine and Pope St. Celestine to suppress this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. After the devastations of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> the Abbey of St. Victor was rebuilt in the first half of the eleventh century, through the efforts of Abbot St. Wiffred. From the middle of the eleventh century its renown was such that from all points of the South appeals were sent to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of this church to restore the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in decadent <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> long kept in touch with the princes of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> and even owned <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. The polyptych of St. Victor, compiled in 814, the large <a href="../cathen/03637a.htm">chartulary</a>, or collection of charters (end of the eleventh and beginning of the twelfth century), and the small <a href="../cathen/03637a.htm">chartulary</a> (middle of the thirteen century) edited by <a href="../cathen/07059a.htm">M. Gu&eacute;rard</a>, and containing documents from 683 to 1336, enable the reader to grasp the important <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> r&ocirc;le of this great <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Blessed Bernard, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Victor 1064-1079 was one of the two ambassadors delegated by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> to the Diet of Forchheim, where the German princes deposed <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Emperor Henry IV</a>. He was seized by one of the partisans of Henry IV and passed several months in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> also sent him as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and in reward for his services exempted St. Victor from all <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> other than that of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>Blessed William de Grimoard was made <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Victor, 2 August, 1361, and became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1362 as <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a>. He enlarged the church, surrounded the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> with high crenelated walls, granted the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and gave him as diocese the suburbs and villages south of the city. He visited Marseilles in October, 1365, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the church, returned to St. Victor in May, 1367, and held a consistory in the Abbey. What became of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of St. Victor is still a problem. Its contents are known through an inventory of the latter half of the twelfth century. It was extremely rich in ancient <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and must have been scattered in the latter half of the sixteenth century, probably between 1579 and 1591; M. Morhreuil conjectures that when Giuliano de' Medici was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> (1570-88) he scattered the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> to please <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">Catherine de' Medici</a>; it is very likely that all or many of the books became the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the king. <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a> was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Victor in 1655. Thomas le Fournier (1675-1745) <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of St. Victor, left numerous <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> which greatly aided the <a href="../cathen/10069b.htm">Maurists</a> in their publications. The secularization of the Abbey of St. Victor was decreed by <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a>, 17 December, 1739.

<p>Councils were held at Marseilles in 533 (when sixteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Provence, under the presidency of St. C&aelig;sarius at Arles, passed sentence on Contumeliosus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Riez), also in 1040 and in 1103. Several <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> belong in a particular way to Marseilles: the soldier St. Victor, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> under <a href="../cathen/10074c.htm">Maximian</a>; the soldier St. Defendens and his companions, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> at the same time; the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> St. Adrian, St. Clemens, and their twenty-eight companions (end of the third century); <a href="../cathen/04582b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toulon (fifth-sixth centuries); St. Eutropius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Orange, native of Marseilles, celebrated for his conflict with <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> and Semipelagianism (fifth century); St. Bonet (Bonitus), prefect of Marseilles in the seventh century, brother of Avitus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>, and a short while <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>; St. Eusebia, <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> founded by Cassian, and massacred by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> with thirty-nine of her companions, (perhaps in 838); St. Tzarn, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Victor, d. in 1048, at whose instigation Raymond B&eacute;ranger, Count of Barcelona, compelled the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> to free the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of L&eacute;rins; St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (1274-97), of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the counts of Provence and buried with the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> of Marseilles; <a href="../cathen/05397a.htm">St. Elziar de Sabran</a> (1286-1323) a student of St. Victor's, and husband of <a href="../cathen/04701a.htm">St. Delphine of Sabran</a>; Blessed Bertrand de Garrigue, (1230), one of the first disciples of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>, founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a> at Marseilles; Blessed Hugues de Digne, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> writer of the thirteenth century, buried at Marseilles (with his sister St. Douceline, foundress of the B&eacute;guines) after having founded near the city, about 1250, the Order of Friars of Penance of Jesus Christ. Hughes de Baux, Viscount of Marseilles induced St. John of Manta to found in Marseilles, in 1202, a house of Trinitarians for the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of captives; in this house the Trinitarians from Southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> held annually their General Chapter. Near by was founded in 1306 a brotherhood of penitents who collected money in the city for the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of captives.

<p>St. Vincent de Paul's first visit to Marseilles, in 1605, on a business matter ended with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> captivity in <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a>; his second visit in 1622, as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> general was marked by the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and heroic <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a> which led him to take the place of a galley slave. In 1643 he sent <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> to attend the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for convicts founded by Philippe Emmanuel de Gondi, Chevalier de la Costa, and Bishop Gault. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> of St. R&eacute;gis was founded in 1724, at Camp Major, for missionaries on their way to the East who studied there the various languages spoken in the commercial towns along the Mediterranean coast. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> also conducted the Royal Marine Observatory and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of hydrography. The <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of Marseilles, founded in 1188, is one of the oldest in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. <a href="../cathen/12764c.htm">Anne Magdaleine de Remusat</a> (1696-1730), daughter of a rich merchant of Marseilles, who had entered the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Visitation of St. Mary, 2 October, 1711, sent word to Mgr Belzunce that on 17 October, 1713, the twenty-third <a href="../cathen/10709a.htm">anniversary of the death</a> of Margaret Mary Alacoque, she had received certain revelations from Christ; in consequence a confraternity of the Sacred Heart was founded, and enriched with <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> (1717); Anne Magdaleine published in 1718 a small manual of devotion to the Sacred Heart. The Marseilles merchants carried this devotion to Constantinople and Cairo and the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> soon comprised 30,000 members. At the time of the plague in Marseilles (39,152 victims out of 80,000 inhabitants), Belzunce, following new revelations received by Anne Magdaleine, instituted in the diocese the feast of the Sacred Heart (22 October, 1720); later, on 4 June, 1722 at his instigation the magistrates <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the city to the Sacred Heart, as the first act of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> formulated to the Sacred Heart by a corporate body.

<p>Marseilles plays also an important part in the history of the devotion to St. Joseph. As early as 1839 <a href="../cathen/10094a.htm">Bishop Mazenod</a> decreed that Marseilles was to venerate St. Joseph as the patron of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and that wherever the churches admitted of three altars one should be dedicated to this saint. The church of Cabot near Marseilles was the first in the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a> to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to St. Joseph as patron of the Universal Church. The <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde dates from 1214. In 1544 a large church was built on the hill overlooking Marseilles; in 1837 a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the Madonna was blessed there, and in 1864 was inaugurated a new sanctuary visited daily by numerous <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Victor is the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Notre-Dame-des-Confessions or Notre-Dame-des-Martyrs, said to have been <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at Marseilles since the end of the second century. The <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of Notre-Dame-du-Sacr&eacute;-Coeur, at Ch&acirc;teau-Gonbert, gave rise to a confraternity which now has almost one million members.

<p>Before the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1901 on associations the Diocese of Marseilles counted <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, African Missionaries, <a href="../cathen/15613d.htm">White Fathers</a>, Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>, <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians</a>, <a href="../cathen/06330b.htm">Brothers of Christian Doctrine of St. Gabriel</a>, <a href="../cathen/09749c.htm">Little Brothers of Mary</a>, <a href="../cathen/13305a.htm">Brothers of the Sacred Heart</a>, <a href="../cathen/02802b.htm">Hospitaller Brothers of St. John of God</a>, Clerks of St. Viateur, Fathers of the Sacred Heart of the Child Jesus. A number of religious congregations for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> originated in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, and Nuns of the Visitation of Saint Mary, contemplative orders founded at Marseilles in 1623; <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters of the Holy Family, founded in 1851 under the name of Soeurs de l'Int&eacute;rieur de J&eacute;sus et Marie; Sisters of Mary Immaculate, who take care of the dumb and the blind; Sisters of Our Lady of Compassion, a teaching order; <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of the Apparition, devoted to nursing and teaching; <a href="../cathen/10678a.htm">Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary</a>, teachers (mother-houses of all the foregoing are in Marseilles); Sisters of the Holy Name of Jesus, a teaching order founded in 1832 (mother-house at La Ciotat), discalced Trinitarian Sisters, founded in 1845 by Abb&eacute; Margalhan-Ferrat, who attend to the sick at home, to <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and until recently to <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (mother-house at Sainte-Marthe). At the beginning of the twentieth century the religious congregations had under their care 5 cr&ecirc;ches, 38 day nurseries, 1 asylum for the blind, 3 boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 21 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 7 industrial work rooms, 4 <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> for the prevention of crime, 1 protectory, 1 dispensary, 1 general pharmacy for <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> of mutual assistance, 4 houses of retreat and sanitariums, 4 houses for the care of the sick in their own homes, 1 insane asylum, 4 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. In 1905 the Diocese of Marseilles (last year of the Concordat) counted 545,445 inhabitants, 11 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 82 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 9 vicariates paid by the State.
