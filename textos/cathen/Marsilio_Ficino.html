<h1>Marsilio Ficino</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, philologist, physician, b. at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 19 Oct., 1433; d. at Correggio, 1 Oct, 1499. Son of the physician of Cosmo de' Medici, he served the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medicis</a> for three generations and received from them a villa at Monte Vecchio. He studied at Florence and at Bologna; and was specially protected in his early work by Cosmo de' Medici, who chose him to translate the works of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> into Latin. The <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> (1439) brought to the city a number of Greek scholars, and this fact, combined with the founding of the Platonic Academy, of which Ficino was elected president, gave an impetus to the study of Greek and especially to that of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. Ficino became an ardent admirer of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and a propagator of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a>, or rather <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonism</a>, to an unwarranted degree, going so far as to maintain that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> should be read in the churches, and claiming <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> as fore-runners of Christ. He taught <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> in the Academy of Florence, and it is said he kept a light burning before a bust of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> in his room. It is supposed that the works of <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a> drew Ficino closer to the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1477 and became a canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Florence. His disposition was mild, but at times he had to use his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of music to drive away melancholy. His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of medicine was applied very largely to himself, becoming almost a <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> in its detail. As a philologist his worth was recognized and Renchlin sent him pupils from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Angelo Poliziano was one of his pupils.

<p>As a translator his work was painstaking and faithful, though his acquaintance with Greek and Latin was by no means perfect. He translated the "Argo-nautica", the "Orphic Hymns", Homer's "Hymns", and Hesiod's "Theogony"; his translation of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> appeared before the Greek text of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> was published. He also translated Plotinus, Porphyry, Proclus, Iamblichus, Alcinous, Synesius, Psellus, the "Golden Thoughts" of Pythagoras, and the works of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Dionysius the Areopagite</a>. When a young man he wrote an "Introduction to the Philosophy of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>"; his most important work was "Theologia Platonica de animarum lmmortalitate" (Florence, 1482); a shorter form of this work is found in his "Compendium theologiae Platonicae". He respects <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and calls <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> the "glory of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>"; yet for him <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> is the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, he says, must rest on philosophic grounds; in <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> alone do we find the arguments to support its claims, hence he considers the revival of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> an intervention of Providence. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> does not stop at immediate causes, but rises to the highest cause, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in Whom he sees all things. The Philosophy of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> is a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> outcome of previous thought, beginning with the Egyptians and advancing step by step till <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> takes up the mysteries of religion and casts them in a form that made it possible for the <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonist</a> to set them forth clearly. The seed is to be found in <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, its full expression in the <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonists</a>. Ficino follows this line of thought in speaking of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which he considered as the image of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God-head</a>, a part of the great chain of existence coming forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and leading back to the same source, giving us at the same time a view of the <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">attributes of God</a> of his relations to the world. His style is not always clear. Perhaps his distinctive merit rests on the fact that he introduced <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> philosophy to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Besides the works already mentioned, he left: "De religione Christiana et fidei pietate", dedicated to Lorenzo de' Medici; "In Epistolas Pauli commentaria", Marsilii Ficini Epistolae (Venice, 1491; Florence, 1497). His collected works: Opera (Florence,1491, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1516, Basel, 1561).
