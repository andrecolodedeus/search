<h1>Marsilius of Padua</h1>  

<p>Physician and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. at Padua about 1270; d. about 1342. Contrary to the assertion of several authors, he was only a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> and neither a religious nor the legitimate <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, though he was a canon of his native city. He served at first in the army of the emperor, and after wards, on the advice of Mussato, began the study of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> at the <a href="../cathen/11387a.htm">University of Padua</a>. To complete his <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medical</a> studies he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and before 25 December, 1312, became <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> there, A little later he went to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and obtained from <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> letters appointing him to one of the <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Padua (Reg. Vat., a. I, p. 2, n. 1714). It was at this time that Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> was about to reopen against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the struggles of Philippe le Bel against <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>. <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> had just denounced Louis as a supporter of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him, and ordered him to cease within three months administering the affairs of the Empire. The emperor was looking for help, and Marsilius, who had now begun the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, joined with Jean de Jandun, canon of Senlis, in offering him his assistance. Together they composed the "Defensor pacis" at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and, about 1326, setting out for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, presented their work to the emperor. They became his intimate friends, and on several occasions expounded their teaching to him. What were the doctrines of these two <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, the very audacity of which at first startled Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>? They recalled the wildest theories of the legists of Philippe le Bel, and C&aelig;sarian <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> like Guilaume Durand and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/08475b.htm">John of Paris</a>. The teachings of these last mentioned had been proposed with hesitation, restrictions, and moderation of language which met with no favour before the rigorous <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> of Marsilius of Padua. He completely abandoned the olden theocratic conception of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, remained the ultimate source of all power, but it sprang immediately from the people, who had in addition the power to legislate. Law was the expression, not of the will of the prince, as <a href="../cathen/08475b.htm">John of Paris</a> taught, but of the will of the people, who, by the voice of the majority, could enact, interpret, modify, suspend, and abrogate it at will. The elected head of the nation was possessed only of a secondary, instrumental, and executive authority. We thus arrive at the theory of the "Contrat Social". In the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, according to the "Defensor Pacis", the faithful have these two great powers &#151; the elective and the legislative. They nominate the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and select those who are to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. The legislative power is, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to decide the meaning of the old Scriptures; that is the work for a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>, in which the right of discussion and voting belongs to the faithful or their delegates. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> power, the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, comes directly from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and consists essentially in the power to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Body and Blood of Jesus Christ</a> and remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or, rather, to declare them remitted. It is equal in all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, each of whom can communicate it by <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to a subject legitimately proposed by the community. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> would have recognized his theories in these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> assertions, and the Gallicans of later times would willingly have subscribed to such revolutionary declarations. The two writers are just as audacious in their exposition of the respective roles of the Empire and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and of the relations of the two powers.

<p>According to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the State propounded by Marsilius all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> power proceeded from the community and from the emperor, its principal representative, there being no limit to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the lay State (cf. Franck, "Journal des savants" March, 1883; No&euml;l Valois, "Histoire litt&eacute;raire de la France", XXXIII). As to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> it has no visible head. St. Peter he goes on, received no more power or authority than the other Apostles, and it is uncertain that he ever came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has only the power of convoking an <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a> which is superior to him. His decrees are not binding; he can impose on the people only what the general council has decided and interpreted. The community elects the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and supervises and controls the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the performance of their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>; in a word &#151; the community or the state is everything, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> playing an entirely subsidiary part. It cannot legislate, adjudicate, possess goods, sell, or purchase without authorization; it is a perpetual minor. As is clear, we have here the civil constitution of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Marsilius, moreover shows himself a severe and often <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> censor of the abuses of the Roman curia. Regarding the relations between the emperor and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, it is maintained in the "Defensor Pacis", that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> has no power over any man, except with the permission of the emperor; while the emperor has power over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the general council. The pontiff can act only as the authorized agent of the Roman people; all the goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> belong by right to C&aelig;sar. This is clearly the crudest concept of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> empire, an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> assault on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> constitution, and a shame less denial of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> to the profit of C&aelig;sar. <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> theorist, is surpassed. <a href="../cathen/01747b.htm">Arnold of Brescia</a> is equalled. William Occam could never have proposed anything more revolutionary.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was stirred by these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> doctrines. In the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 3 April, 1327, <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> reproached Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> with having welcomed <em>duos perditionis filios et maledictionis alumnos</em> (<a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, "Chart", II, 301). On 9 April he suspended and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> them ("Thesaurus novus anecdotorum", ii, 692). A commission, appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, condemned on 23 October five of the propositions of Marsilius in the following terms: "1) These reprobates do not hesitate to affirm in what is related of Christ in the Gospel of St. Matthew, to wit that He paid tribute . . . that he did so, not through condescension and liberality, but of necessity &#151; an assertion that runs counter to the teaching of the Gospel and the words of our Saviour. If one were to believe these men, it would follow that all the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a> belongs to the emperor, and that he may take possession of it again as his own; 2) These sons of <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a> are so audacious as to affirm that the Blessed Apostle St. Peter received no more authority than the other Apostles, that he was not appointed their chief and further that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> gave no head to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and appointed no one as His vicar here below &#151; all which is contrary to the Apostolic and evangelic <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; 3) These children of <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a> do not fear to assert that the emperor has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to appoint, to dethrone, and even to punish the pop &#151; which is undoubtedly repugnant to all right; 4) These frivolous and lying men say that all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, be they <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, or simple <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are possessed of equal authority and equal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, by the institution of Christ; that whatever one possesses beyond another is a concession of the Emperor, who can moreover revoke what he has granted,-which assertions are certainly contrary to sacred teaching and savour of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; 5) these blasphemers say that the universal Church may not inflict a coactive penalty on any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> unless with the emperor's permission." All the pontifical propositions opposed to the declarations of Marsilius of Padua and Jean de Jandun are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> at length from the Scriptures, traditions, and history. These declarations are condemned as being contrary to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, dangerous to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> and their authors Marsilius and Jean as being undoubtedly <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and even heresiarchs (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchiridion", 423, ed. Bannwart, 495; Noel Valois, "Histoire litt&eacute;raire de la France", XXXIII, 592).

<p>As this condemnation was falling on the head of Marsilius, the culprit was coming to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in the emperor's train and he saw his revolutionary <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> being put into practice. Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> had himself <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> by Colonna syndic of the Roman people; he dethroned <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, replacing him by the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friar Minor</a>, Peter of Corbara, whom he invested with temporal power. At the same time he bestowed the title of imperial vicar on Marsilius and permitted him to persecute the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> protested twice against the sacrilegious conduct of both. The triumph of Marsilius was, however, of short duration. Abandoned by the emperor in October, 1336, he died towards the end of 1342. Among his principal works, the "Defensor Pacis", which we possess in twenty <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, has been printed frequently and translated into various languages. The "Defensor Minor" a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the preceding work compiled by Marsihus himself, has just been recovered in the Bodleian Library, Oxford (Canon. Miscell., 188). It throws light on certain points in the larger work; but has not yet been published. "De translatione Imperii Romani" has been printed four times in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and once in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. "De jurisdictione Imperatoris in causa matrimoniali" has been edited by Preher and by Goldast (Monarchia sancti Rom. Imperii, II, c. 1283). The influence of the "Defensor pacis" was disastrous, and Marsilius may well be reckoned one of the fathers of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>.
