<h1>Martin Bucer</h1>  

<p>(Also called BUTZER.)

<p>One of the leaders in the South German <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> movement, b. 11 November, 1491, at Schlettstadt, Alsace; d. 28 February, 1551, at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at the Latin School of his native place, where at the age of fifteen (1506) he also entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>. Later he was sent to the <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">University of Heidelberg</a> to prosecute his studies, and matriculated, 31 January, 1517. He became an ardent admirer of <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a>, and soon an enthusiastic disciple of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. He heard the Saxon <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at a public disputation, held at <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">Heidelberg</a> in 1518, on the occasion of a meeting of the Augustinian order, became personally acquainted with him, and was immediately won over to his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Having openly adopted the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> he withdrew from the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican order</a>, in 1521, became court <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of Frederick the Elector Palatine, and laboured as <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a> at Landstuhl, in the Palatinate (1522), and as a member of the household of Count Sickengen and at Weissenburg, Lower Alsace (1522-23). During his incumbency at Landstuhl he married Elizabeth Silbereisen, a former <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>. When, in 1523, his position became untenable at Weissenburg, he proceeded to Strasburg. Here his activity was soon exercised over a large field; he became the chief reformer of the city and was connected with many important religio-political events of the period. His <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> views on points controverted between <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> at first harmonized completely with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Reformer. Subsequently he sought to mediate between <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> and <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglians</a>. The highly questionable methods to which he resorted in the interest of peace drew upon him the denunciation of both parties. In spite of the efforts of Bucer, the Conference of Marburg (1529), at which the divergent views of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, especially the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> regarding the Eucharist, were discussed, failed to bring about a reconciliation. At the Diet of Augsburg, in the following year, he drew up with Capito the "Confessio Tetrapolitana", or Confession of the Four Cities (Strasburg, <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, Memmingen, and Lindau). Later on, moved by political considerations, he abandoned this for the Augsburg Confession. In 1536, he brought about the more nominal than real "Concordia of <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>" among German <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. He gave his own, and obtained <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> and <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon's</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> for the bigamy of the Landgrave Philip of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, attended in 1540 the religious conference between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> at Hagenau, Lower Alsace, and in 1541 the Diet of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. The combined attempt of Bucer and <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> to introduce the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> into the <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Archdiocese of Cologne</a> ended in failure (1542). Political troubles and the resistance of Bucer to the agreement arrived at by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in 1548, and known as the "Augsburg Interim", made his stay in Strasburg impossible. At the invitation of Archbishop Cranmer, he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1549. After a short stay in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, during which he was received by King Edward VI (1547-53), he was called to Cambridge as Regius Professor of Divinity. His opinion was frequently asked by Cranmer on church matters, notably on the controversy regarding <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> vestments. But his sojourn was to be of short duration, as he died in February, 1551. Under the reign of <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> (1553-58) his remains were exhumed and burned, and his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> was demolished (1556), but was reconstructed in 1560 by Queen Elizabeth (1558-1603).

<p>Bucer was, after <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, the most influential of German <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>. For a clear statement of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> he was ever ready to substitute vague formulas in the interest of unity, which even his able efforts could not establish among the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>. He forms a connecting link between the German and the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Of the thirteen children he had by his first marriage, only one, a weak-minded son, survived. Wibrandis Rosenblatt, the successive wife of several <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> (Cellarius, <a href="../cathen/11213a.htm">&OElig;colampadius</a>, Capito, and Bucer), whom he married after his first wife died from the plague in 1541, bore him three children, of whom a daughter survived. Only one of the ten folio volumes in which his works were to appear was published (Basle, 1577). It is known as "Tomas Anglicanus" because its contents were mostly written in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.
