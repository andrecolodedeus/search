<h1>Martin Eisengrein</h1>  

<p>A learned <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and polemical writer, born of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> at Stuttgart, 28 December, 1535; died at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>, 4 May, 1578. He studied the humanities at the Latin <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Stuttgart, and the liberal arts and philosophy at the <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">University of T&uuml;bingen</a>. To please his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, who was burgomaster of Stuttgart, Eisengrein matriculated as student of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> at the <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a>, 25 May, 1553, but before a year had passed he was at the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a>, where he took the degree of Master of Arts in May, 1554. During the tolerant rule of Ferdinand I, Eisengrein, though still a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, became in 1555 professor of oratory and, two years later, of physics at the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institution. Though his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> surroundings and especially his frequent intercourse with the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> may have had great influence in bringing about his acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, still his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> was one of conviction, as is apparent from his numerous controversial writings and his scrupulous solicitude for the integrity of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> at the <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a>. His conversion took place about 1558. In 1559 he received a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> at St. Stephen's in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and a year later he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In 1562 he went to the <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a> whither he had been invited by the superintendent of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Frederick Staphylus. He was appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the church of <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a>, which was incorporated with the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and in April of the same year he was elected <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Besides being professor, he devoted much of his time to the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and, after receiving the degree of licentiate in this <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> on 11 November, 1563, he began to teach it in January, 1564. Duke Albert V of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> chose him as councillor, appointed him <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the collegiate church of Moosburg, and shortly afterwards of the collegiate church of Alt&ouml;tting and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a>. In 1563 and 1564 he took part in the politico-religious conferences at the imperial court of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>; in 1566 Duke Albert sent him to <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pope Pius V</a> to advocate the appointment of Prince Ernest as Prince-Bishop of Freising, and in 1568-9 he was imperial court <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. In 1570 he was appointed superintendent of the <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a>, and henceforth he turned his whole attention to the advancement of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>.

<p>Just at this time the friction between the lay professors and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, which dated from the time when the latter began to hold professorial chairs at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1556, threatened to become serious. In 1568 Eisengrein and Peter Canisius had peacefully settled certain differences between the two factions, but when in 1571 Duke Albert decided to put the <em>p&oelig;dagogium</em> and the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> course into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the other professors loudly protested. By his tact Eisengrein succeeded in temporarily reconciling the non-Jesuit professors to the new arrangement. Soon, however, hostilities began anew, and in order to put an end to these quarrels, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> transferred the <em>P&oelig;dagogium</em> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> course to <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> in 1573. It seems that the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were indispensable to the <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a>, for two years later they were urgently requested by the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> to return, and in 1576 they again went to Ingolstadt. In the settlement of the differences between the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> and non-Jesuit professors, Eisengrein always had the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at heart. He publicly acknowledged the great efficiency of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> as educators in an oration which he delivered before the professors and students of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> on 19 February, 1571, and he was pleased to see their influence gradually increase at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>. There were, indeed, some differences between Eisengrein and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in 1572, but the estrangement was only temporary, as is apparent from the fact that he bequeathed 100 florins to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>.

<p>The greatest service which Eisengrein rendered the <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a> was his organization of its <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. It was owing to his efforts that the valuable private <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of John Egolph, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, Thaddeus Eck, chancellor of Duke Albert, and Rudolph Clenek, professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>, were added to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. Eisengrein's activities were not confined to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. By numerous controversial sermons, some of which are masterpieces of oratory, he contributed not a little to the suppression of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. Many of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> were published separately and collectively in German and Latin during his lifetime. Some have been edited by <a href="../cathen/02790a.htm">Brischar</a> in "Die kath. Kanzelredner Deutschlands" (Schaffhausen, 1867-70), I, 434-545. He is also the author of a frequently reprinted history of the shrine of the Blessed Virgin at Alt&ouml;tting (Ingolstadt, 1571) and a few other works of minor importance.
