<h1>Martin John Spalding</h1>  

<p>Seventh <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, b. Bardstown, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, 23 May, 1810; d., at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 7 Feb., 1872. His forbears came from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and settled in <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> about the middle of the seventeenth century; his grandfather removed to <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a> in 1790. Martin Spalding entered St. Mary's College, <a href="../cathen/09104a.htm">Lebanon</a>, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, in 1821, taught mathematics there at the age of fourteen, was graduated in 1826, and studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> during four years in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Bardstown. In 1830 he entered the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where after a brilliant course he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> 13 Aug., 1834, and received the doctorate in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the close of a public defence of 256 theses. Upon his return to Bardstown, he became <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and editor of the "Catholic Advocate", founded in 1835. After the transfer of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> (1844), coadjutor <em>cum jure</em> to Bishop Flaget (1848), and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a> (1850). The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which then numbered over 30,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was well provided with <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls, but there were comparatively few <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys. To supply this need and to recruit the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, Bishop Spalding, shortly after the dedication of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in 1852, went to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and secured the services of the <a href="../cathen/15728b.htm">Xaverian Brothers</a> who came to Louisville in 1854. During his visit to <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of founding the American College at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> which, mainly through his efforts, was opened in 1857. Much of his time was devoted to lectures and controversial writings in defence of the church, especially against the <a href="../cathen/08677a.htm">Know-Nothing</a> movement and the common <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system from which religious instruction was excluded. He had already published "Evidences of Catholicity", a series of lectures delivered in 1844-5, and the "Life, Times and Character of Benedict Joseph Flaget" (Louisville, 1852); these were followed by his "Miscellanea" (1853) and his "History of the Protestant Reformation" (1860) in which he enlarged his "Review of D'Aubign&eacute;'s &aelig;History of the Reformation'", published in 1840. He also lectured at the Smithsonian Institute, Washington, and in <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, New York, <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, and other cities. In 1864, on the death of <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Spalding succeeded him in the See of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. Here he organized the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">St. Vincent de Paul Society</a>, founded the House of the Good Shepherd and St. Mary's Industrial School, and completed the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In October, 1866, the Second Plenary Council assembled at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>; Archbishop Spalding arranged the details and presided over the deliberations. He had previously suggested the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and it was chiefly due to his efforts that the project was endorsed by the council. In 1867 he again visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and took part in the celebration of the centenary of St. Peter's <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. As the American College in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was in need of funds, Archbishop Spalding issued an appeal, which resulted in placing the college on a sound financial basis. His labours in behalf of religion and the spreading of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> were incessant. In 1868 he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02382a.htm">Bishop Becker</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15646c.htm">See of Wilmington</a> and Bishop Gibbons for the Vicariate Apostolic of North Carolina. Within one year (1868-9) he administered confirmation a hundred times, one eighth of the recipients being converts. He welcomed the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a> to Baltimore (1869), invited Father Herbert Vaughan to evangelize the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> (1871), and aided <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Father Hecker</a> in establishing the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Publication Society of New York. At the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> he was a member of the Commission on Faith and of the Commission on "Postulata" which had to examine all the matters proposed for deliberation before they were presented to the council. He was a strong supporter of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> and he drew up a postulatum in which he favoured a definition by implication in preference to an explicit affirmation of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. Immediately after the final vote on <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>, Archbishop Spalding addressed a pastoral letter to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> of his archdiocese, in which he set the action of the council in the proper light and cleared away numerous misrepresentations. Shortly after his return to America he spoke at Philadelphia in defence of the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and on 18 June, 1871, he commemorated with fitting observance the jubilee of the elevation of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chair, the last notable celebration in which he took part. Archbishop Spalding was a fine representative of the type of men who organized and developed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. To a strong <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he added sincere <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and tender devotion, to scholarship a high degree of administrative ability, and to his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> a loyal interest in the welfare of his country. He enjoyed the esteem of those who were foremost in <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, and his death was the occasion of tributes from all classes of his fellow-citizens. His complete works were published at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> in several editions.
