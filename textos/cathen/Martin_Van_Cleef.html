<h1>Martin Van Cleef</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> in 1520; died in 1570; was the son of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> William (the younger William) and was throughout his life closely associated with his brother Henry, who exerted great influence over his artistic career. Deschamps asserts that Martin and <a href="../cathen/04010e.htm">Joost</a> were brothers, but the majority of writers on <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> art agree that <a href="../cathen/04010e.htm">Joost</a> was the son of the elder William. Martin studied under Franz Floris, "the incomparable Floris", and at first exhibited a strong predilection for landscape work. Later on, however, persuaded by Henry, devoted himself wholly to figure-painting. Historical subjects were his favourites, but he also achieved great success in genre <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. The latter has been stigmatized as vulgar and suggestive, but while coarse, and reflecting the peasant life of the Flemings, it differed but little in this respect from canvases of the great <a href="../cathen/07393b.htm">Dutchmen</a>. After a few early attempts in large compositions after the Italian manner of Floris, he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> small pictures only, and these with great spirit and thorough technic. His work is delicate and refined in treatment, harmonious in colour, and excellent in draughtsmanship.

<p>Martin van Cleef <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in the landscapes the figures of many eminent contemporaries, Gilles and Franz Floris among them, and he continually collaborated with his brother Henry in that way. Henry reciprocated and added to Martin's figure-pieces landscape backgrounds charming in colour and design, and harmonizing well with the rest of the picture. On many of his works Martin <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a>, as a mark, a small ape &#151; playing thus on his name &#151; and in consequence is frequently called the "Master of the Ape". He was admitted to the Antwerp Academy, and in 1551 became a member of the St. Luke's Guild of Artists. He never travelled from his native <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, and died of gout at the age of fifty, leaving four sons &#151; all of them <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>.
