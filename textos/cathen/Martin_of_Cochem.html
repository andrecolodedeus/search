<h1>Martin of Cochem</h1>  

<p>A celebrated German <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, preacher and <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetic</a> writer, born at Cochem, a small town on the Moselle, in 1630; died in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Wagh&auml;usel, 10 September, 1712. He came of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> devotedly attached to the Faith, and while still young entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, where he distinguished himself by his fervour and his fidelity to the religious rule. After his elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, he was assigned to a professorship of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, a position which for several years he filled most creditably. However, it was in another sphere that he was to exercise his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and acquire fame. Of the evils which befell <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a>, the plague was by no means the least, and when, in 1666, it made its appearance in the Rhenish country, such were its ravages that it became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to close the novitiates and houses of study. Just at this crisis, Father Martin was left without any special charge and, in company with his fellow <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, he devoted himself to the bodily and spiritual comfort of the afflicted. What most distressed him was the religious <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to which a large number of the faithful had fallen victims on account of being deprived of their <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>. To combat this sad condition, he resolved to compose little popular treatises on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of religion, and in 1666 he published at Cologne a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> that was very well received. It was a revelation to his superiors, who strongly encouraged the author to continue in this course.

<p>Thenceforth Father Martin made a specialty of popular preaching and religious writing and, in the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> and Ingelheim, which he traversed thoroughly, multitudes pressed about him, and numerous conversions followed. The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> continued these active ministrations up to the time of his death, and even when he had passed his eightieth year he still went daily to the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, where, with the aid of an ear-trumpet, he heard the confessions of the sinners who flocked to him. The intervals between missions he devoted to his numerous writings, the most voluminous of which is an <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> in 2 vols, fol., composed for apologetic purposes and provoked by the attacks made upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. However, the author brought it down only to the year 1100. Father Martin's other works embrace a great variety of subjects: the life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">legends of the saints</a>, edifying narratives, the setting forth of certain points in <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">Christian asceticism</a>, forms of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, methods to be followed for the worthy reception of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, etc. These widely different themes have as points of similarity a pleasing, graceful style, great erudition, and a truly seraphic eloquence. They bespeak for their author sincere <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and deep religious sentiment, coupled with an intimate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the popular heart and the special needs of the time. But the best known of all the learned <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin's</a> works is unquestionably "Die heilige Messe", upon which, according to his own statement, he spent three entire years, perusing <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, the councils, Fathers and <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctors of the Church</a>, and the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, in order to condense into a small volume a properly abridged account of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>. As soon as it appeared this book <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a delight to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, nor has it yet lost any of its popularity, and, since its translation into several languages, it may be said to have acquired universal renown.

<p>It demanded a great expenditure of energy on the part of the worthy religious to bring these undertakings to a successful issue. Even when in his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> he spent most of the day in directing <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and following the observances prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> Rule, hence it was time set aside for sleep that he was wont to give to his literary labours. Sometimes after the Office of <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> he would obtain permission of the superior to go to Frankfort to confer with his publisher and, this accomplished, he would return on foot to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at K&ouml;nigstein, catechizing little children, hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>, and visiting the sick along the way. While still in the midst of his labours he was attacked by an illness to which he soon succumbed, at the age of eighty-two. The works published during Father Martin's lifetime are: "Die Kirchenhistorie nach der Methode des Baronius und Raynaldus bis 1100" (Dillingen, 1693): "Die christliche Lehre"; "Heilige Geschichten und Exempel"; "Wohlriechender Myrrhengarten" (Cologne, 1693); "B&uuml;chlein &uuml;ber den Ablass" (Dillingen, 1693); "Exorcismen und f&uuml;r Kranke" (Frankfort, 1695); "Goldener Himmelsschl&uuml;ssel" (Frankfort, 1695); "Gebetbuch f&uuml;r Soldaten" (Augsburg, 1698); "Anmuthungen w&auml;hrend der heiligen Messe" (Augsburg, 1697); "Die Legenden der Heiligen" (Augsburg, 1705); "Leben Christi" (Frankfort, 1689; Augsburg, 1708); "Gebete unter der heiligen Messe" (Augsburg, 1698); "Kern der heiligen Messe" (Cologne, 1699); "Liliengarten" (Cologne, 1699); "Gebetbuch f&uuml;r heilige Zeiten" (Augsburg, 1704); "Die heilige Messe f&uuml;r die Weitleute" (Cologne, 1704); "Traktat &uuml;ber die g&ouml;ttlichen Vortrefflichkeiten" (Mainz, 1707); "Geistlicher Baumgarten" (Mainz and Heidelberg, 1709); "Neue mystische Goldgruben" (Cologne, 1709); "Exemepelbuch" (Augsburg, 1712). This list does not include all the author's writings. In 1896 there appeared a small work never before published, "Das Gebet des Herzens", which at the end of its third year went into a seventh edition.
