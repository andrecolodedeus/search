<h1>Martinique</h1>  

<p>(SANCTI PETRI ET ARCIS GALLICA&#198;)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a>; Martinique is one of the French Lesser Antilles, 380 sq. miles in area; It was discovered by <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Christopher Columbus</a> in 1493, and colonized by the French about 1625; it was in the hands of the English from 1762-1783, and was again occupied by them in 1792, 1802, 1809, 1815 and again became French territory in 1818. The name <em>Martinique</em> comes from the Carib word <em>Madinima.</em> On <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, 1640, P&#232;res Bouton and Hempteau, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> set out for Martinique, where they founded the celebrated <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> mission. P&#232;res Ceubergeon and Gueimu, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were slain there in 1654 by the revolting Caribs. The "M&eacute;moire concernant la Mission des P&#232;res de la Compagnie de J&eacute;sus dans les iles fran&#231;aises de l'Amerique" addressed in 1707 by P&#232;re Combaid to P&#232;re Tambourini, General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and published in 1907 by P&#232;re Rochemonteix, contains moving details concerning the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instructions of the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">Negro</a> slaves by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. In 1753 P&#232;re de Lavalette was named superior general and <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">Prefect Apostolic</a> of the Mission of Martinique; his business transactions were later the cause of very violent attacks on the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. P&#232;re Rochemonteix has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that P&#232;re Lavalette acted thus without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> even of his fellow missionaries of Martinique or his superiors in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; that when at length in 1759 and 1760, the missionaries accused him of taking part in forbidden traffic they had no written <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, and that the superiors were not certain until 1762, after the investigation of P&#232;re de la Marche, when P&#232;re de Lavalette was deposed, silenced and sent back to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. When in 1848 the Second Republic suppressed slavery in the colonies the <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a>, Castelli, in a public address, hailed the new epoch as "an era of light and evangelical regeneration".

<p>The diocese of Martinique is suffragan of the <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Archdiocese of Bordeaux</a>, was created 27 Sept. 1850, and by a law of 20 July, and by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 18 December, 1850. At first the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was fixed at Fort de France, was transferred to St. Pierre on 12 Sept., and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> took the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Pierre and Fort de France. Bishop Le Herpeur (1851-1858), organized the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of Notre Dame de la D&eacute;liverande . Bishop Fava (1872-1879, founded in 1872, a religious weekly bulletin, which later became the daily "Le Bien Public". Martinique was cruelly tried 8 May, 1902, by the eruption of Mt. Pel&eacute;e, which had long been considered an extinct volcano. This eruption completely destroyed the town of St. Pierre. The island suffered also from the cyclone of 8 Aug 1902, and the earthquake of 1906. After the catastrophe of 1902, the episcopal residence was again transferred to Fort de France. The diocese of Martinique contains 170,000 inhabitants and 46 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. There are in the diocese <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Fathers of the Holy Ghost</a>, <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Cluny and of St. Paul of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and teaching sisters. The Congregation of Notre Dame de la D&eacute;livrande had its origin in the diocese. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Mgr de Cormont, was born at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 29 March, 1847. Chosen as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> 14 December, 1899, in succession to Msgr. Carmen&eacute;, who resigned.
