<h1>Martinsberg</h1>  

<p>(Or P<font size=-2>ANNONHALMA</font>)

<p>An important <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> about fourteen English miles south of Raab, and sixty west of Buda-Pesth. From an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the place was traditionally regarded as the scene of the birth and early life of the famous <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a> and was held in great veneration by the small <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> population of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. Towards the end of the tenth century the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was begun by Duke Geysa, and completed by his more celebrated son, St. Stephen, the king. The second <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of October, 1001, witnessed the dedication of the church. The site is a pleasant one on a high plateau with extensive views to the north and east, and occupies the ground once covered by a strongly fortified Roman encampment. Almost uninterruptedly from that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the "Holy Mountain of Hungary", as it came to be called, has been the centre of all that is best in the religious and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life of the kingdom. The first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> established in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, it soon attracted large numbers of students; <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and kings increased and guaranteed its possessions, and owing to its strongly fortified position it escaped destruction more than once when all around was ruined. The Tartar invasion left it unscathed. It was less fortunate under Archabbot Matthew, who died in 1584, during the disastrous five years in which the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> were masters of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, though it escaped annihilation till the fall of its fortress in 1594, when the community was scattered. The younger <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were received into various Austrian <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and the valuable archives were sacred from destruction. It was not till peace was fully restored in 1683 that St. Martin's Abbey rose from its ashes, the only house of the fifty which had belonged to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. Its <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were reopened in 1724 and flourished till the days of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> the "Sacristan" (1780-86), whose narrowmindedness could not leave untouched so vigorous a centre of religious feeling and Hungarian sentiment and language.

<p>The eclipse of Martinsberg lasted about sixteen years. In 1802, on 12 March, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and its colleges were reopened in deference to the general desire of the nation, and an archabbot was appointed in the person of Dom Chrysostom Novak. Since that time the fortunes of the community have prospered. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and church have been rebuilt in the Italian style, and form an imposing group of buildings. The house is the central home of all the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the Hungarian congregation; its superior, the archabbot, is a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> "nullius", <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, Ordinary of the Diocese, perpetual President of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Congregation of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and a member of the House of Magnates of the kingdom. Subject to his government, besides the actual community at Martinsberg, are the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a> and Companions at Bakonybel, of St. Anian at Tihany, of St. Mary at Doemelk, and St. Hadrian at Zalavar, and six residences, with colleges attached, in various parts of the kingdom, Gy&ouml;r with 448 students, Sopron with 345, Estergom with 366, and three minor gymnasia, Koszeg with 208, Komarom with 144, and Papa with 157 students. The entire congregation of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarian</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> numbers about 160 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, with some 40 or 50 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>. The congregation administers also in 26 incorporated <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with seventy-five daughter churches and forty-four <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; serving a population of nearly 18,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; it has the supervision besides of five <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; its high schools, "gymnasia majora" are attended by about 1200 boys, its lesser <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> by over 500. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of St. Martin's have contributed largely to the modern <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, scientific and historical literature of their country, and have given many distinguished men to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Cardinal Claud Vaszary, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>, and Bishop Kohl, his auxiliary, are perhaps the best known representatives of the Hungarian <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> at the present day.
