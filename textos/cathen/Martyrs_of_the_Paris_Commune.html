<h1>Martyrs of the Paris Commune</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and the religious who were <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in May 1871, on account of their sacred calling. They may be divided into three groups: <ol> <li>those who on the 24th of May were executed within the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of La Roquette; <li>the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers, who, on the following day, were shot down at the Barri&egrave;re d' Italie; <li>the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious who, on the 26th of May were massacred at <a href="../cathen/02414c.htm">Belleville</a>. </ol>

<p>The revolutionary party which took possession of the city after the siege of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussians</a> began, in the last days of March, to arrest the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious to whom personal character or official position gave a certain prominence. No reason was given for these arbitrary measures, except the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> with which the leaders of the Commune regarded the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and her <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>.

<p>(1) At the head of the first group of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> is the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/04634b.htm">Monseigneur Georges Darboy</a>, to whom the discomforts of his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> life were peculiarly trying on account of his feeble health. His fellow sufferers were: the Abb&eacute; Duguerry, cur&eacute; of the important <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of La Madeleine, an old man, well-advanced in years, but bright and vigorous; the Abb&eacute; Allard, a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>, who had rendered good service to the wounded during the siege, and two <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> Ducoudray and Clerc. The first was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the Ecole Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve, a well known preparatory <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the army: the second had been a distinguished naval officer; both were gifted and holy men. To these five <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> was added a magistrate, Senator Bonjean. After several weeks of confinement, first in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> or Mazas, then at La Roquette, these six <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> were executed on 24 May. There was no pretense made of judging them, neither was any accusation brought against them. This revolutionary party still held possession of the east of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, but the regular army, whose headquarters were at <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a>, was fast approaching, and the leaders of the Commune, made desperate by failure, wished to inflict what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> they could on an enemy they no longer hoped to conquer. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had, one and all, endured their captivity with patience and dignity the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, their letters prove it, had no illusions as to their probable fate, <a href="../cathen/04634b.htm">Archbishop Darboy</a> and the Abb&eacute; Deguerry were more sanguine. "What have they to gain by killing us? What harm have we done them?" often said the latter. The execution took place in the evening. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> absolved his companions who were calm and recollected. They were told to stand against a wall, within the precincts of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and here they were shot down at close quarters by twenty men, enlisted for the purpose. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> hand was raised to give a last blessing: "Here take my <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a>", said one of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murders</a> and by discharging his gun he give the signal for the execution.

<p>(2) The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers, who perished the following day 25 May, belonged to the College of Arcueil, close to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Their superior was Father Captier, who founded the college and under whose government it had prospered. With him were for religious of his order: Fathers Bourard, Delhorme Cottrault, and Chatagneret, and eight <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, who belonged to the college, either as professors or as servants. They were arrested on the 19th of May and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the outlying fort of Bic&ecirc;tre, where they suffered from hunger and thirst. On the 25th of May they were transferred from Bic&ecirc;tre to a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> within the city, situated on the Avenue d' Italie. The excitement and <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a> that reigned in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and the insults that were levelled at the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> as they were led from one <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> to another prepared them for the worst; they made their confession and prepared for death. Towards five in the afternoon, they were commanded to go into the street one by one: Father Captier, whose strong <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> sustained his companion's <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, turned to them: "Let us go, my friends, for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". The street was filled with armed men who discharged their guns at the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> as they passed. Father Captier was mortally wounded; his companions fell here and there; some were killed on the spot; others lingered on till their assassins put them out of their pain. Their dead bodies remained for twenty-four hours on the ground, exposed to an insult; only the next morning, when the troops from <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a> had conquered the Commune, were they claimed by the victims' friends and conveyed to Arcuil.

<p>(3) The third group of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> perished on the 26th of May; the revolutionists were now driven back by the steady advance of the regular troops, and only the heights of <a href="../cathen/02414c.htm">Belleville</a> were still in the possession of the Commune. Over fifty <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> were taken from the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of La Roquette and conducted on foot to this last stronghold of the revolution. Among them were eleven <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>: three <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, four members of the Congregation of the Sacred Heart and Mary, three <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, and one seminarist. All displayed heroic <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, the best known among them was <a href="../cathen/11243b.htm">Father Olivaint</a>, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> house of the Rue de S&egrave;vres, who thirsted for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. After a painful journey through the streets, which were filled with an infuriated rabble, the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> were into an enclosure, called the cite Vincennes, on the height of Belleville. Here they were hacked to pieces by a crowd of men, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and even children. There was no attempt to organize a regular execution like the one at La Raquette; the massacre lasted an hour, and most of the bodies were disfigured beyond recognition. Only a few hours later the regular troops forced their way to La Roquette, delivered the prisoners that still remained there, and took possession of <a href="../cathen/02414c.htm">Belleville</a>, the stronghold of Commune.
