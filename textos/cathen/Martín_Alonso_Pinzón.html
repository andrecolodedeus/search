<h1>Mart&iacute;n Alonso Pinz&oacute;n</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> navigator and companion of <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> on his first voyage to the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>, b. at Palos de Moguer, 1441; d. there at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of La R&aacute;bida, 1493. Sprung from a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of seamen, he became a hardy sailor and skilful pilot. According to Parkman and other historians, he sailed under Cousin, a navigator from Dieppe, to the eastern coast of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, whence they were carried far to the south-west. They there discovered an unknown land and a mighty river. Pinz&oacute;n's conduct on this voyage was so mutinous that Cousin entered a complaint to the admiralty on their return home, and had him dismissed from the maritime service of Dieppe. Returning to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> Pinz&oacute;n became acquainted with <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> through Fray Juan Perez de Marchina, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of La R&aacute;bida, and became an enthusiastic promoter of the scheme of the great navigator. Other historians account differently for the origin of Pinz&oacute;n's interest in <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus's</a> project. According to these, he heard of the scheme several years after he had retired from active life as a sailor, and established with his brothers a shipbuilding firm in his native town. During a visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he learned from the Holy Office of the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> which had been paid from the beginning of the fifteenth century from a country named Vinland, and examined the charts of the Norman explorers. On his return home he supported the claims of <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a>, when his opinion was sought by Queen Isabella's advisers concerning the proposed voyage. It was he who paid the one-eighth of the expense demanded from <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> as his share, and built the three vessels for the voyage. Through his influence also <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> secured the crews for the transatlantic journey. Pinz&oacute;n commanded the "Pinta", and his brother Vicente Ya&ntilde;ez the "Ni&ntilde;a". On 21 November, 1492, he deserted <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> off Cuba, hoping to be the first to discover the imaginary island of Osabeque. He was the first to discover Haiti (Hispaniola), and the river where he landed (now the Porto Caballo) was long called after him the River of Martin Alonso. He carried off thence four men and two girls, intending to steal them as slaves, but he was compelled to restore them to their homes by <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a>, whom he rejoined on the coast of <a href="../cathen/07114a.htm">Haiti</a> on 6 January, 1493. It was during this absence that the flagship was driven ashore, and <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> compelled to take to the "Ni&ntilde;a". In excuse for his conduct, Pinz&oacute;n afterwards alleged stress of weather. Off the coast of the <a href="../cathen/02168a.htm">Azores</a> he again deserted, and set sail with all speed for <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, hoping to be the first to communicate the news of the discovery. Driven by a hurricane into the port of <a href="../cathen/02360b.htm">Bayonne</a> in Galicia, he sent a letter to the king asking for an audience. The monarch refusing to receive anyone but the admiral, Pinz&oacute;n sailed for Palos, which he reached on the same day as <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> (15 March, 1493). Setting out immediately for <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> to make a fresh attempt to see the king, he was met by a messenger who forbade him to appear at court. Anger and jealousy, added to the privations of the voyage, undermined his health, and led to his death a few months later.
