<h1>Mart&iacute;n Fern&aacute;ndez de Enciso</h1>  

<p>Navigator and geographer, b. at <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, c. 1470; d. probably about 1528 at Seville. It is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> when, why, or with whom he went to America, but in 1508 he was living on the island of <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>, where he had accumulated a fortune in the practice of law. In 1509 <a href="../cathen/11230a.htm">Alonzo de Ojeda</a> (or Hojeda) had been granted the government of Terra Firme (the region about the Isthmus of Darien), but he lacked the funds <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to colonize the country. He then applied to Enciso, who had the reputation of being rich, able, and adventurous, and the latter agreed to provide a vessel with men and provisions. Ojeda set out in advance in 1509, and it was agreed that Enciso was to equip his vessel and follow him in 1510. When the latter arrived, he found that Ojeda, having been beset by hostile Indians, and having exhausted his supplies and ammunition, had returned in search of him. Taking the survivors of Ojeda's expedition, Enciso founded the town of Santa Mar&iacute;a la Antigua del Darien (1510). Among his followers was one <a href="../cathen/02216c.htm">Vasco Nu&ntilde;ez de Balboa</a> who afterwards became famous for his discovery of the Pacific Ocean, then called the South Sea (Mar del Sur), and who had joined the expedition without Enciso's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or authority, seeking to escape his creditors. Soon after the founding of the new city, <a href="../cathen/02216c.htm">Balboa</a> stirred up rebellion among the men, and was able to depose Enciso, whom he banished to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Here, the latter complained to the king of <a href="../cathen/02216c.htm">Balboa's</a> arbitrary conduct and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and the king, partly owing to these accusations, sent Pedrarias D&aacute;vila to America in 1514 as Governor of Darien, with instructions to have the wrongs of Enciso righted. Enciso accompanied the expedition as "alguacil mayor" and continued to oppose <a href="../cathen/02216c.htm">Balboa</a> until the latter's execution by D&aacute;vila in 1517. He soon afterwards returned to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> where he published his "Suma de Geografia que trata de todas las partidas del mundo", the first account in Spanish of the discoveries in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>. The work was published in 1519 at Seville and was reprinted in 1530 and in 1549. It is dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>, and in it, according to <a href="../cathen/10723c.htm">Navarrete</a>, Enciso has embodied all that was then known of the theory and practice of navigation. The geographical portion is given with great care, and contains the first descriptions of the lands discovered in the western seas, that is, the results of the explorations of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> up to 1519. It is, on the whole, a more accurate work than the other early works of its kind.
