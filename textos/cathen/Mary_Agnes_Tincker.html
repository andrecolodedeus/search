<h1>Mary Agnes Tincker</h1>  

<p>Novelist, born at Ellsworth, <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, 18 July, 1833; died at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, 4 December, 1907. At the age of thirteen she began teaching in the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. At fifteen her first literary work was printed. At twenty she <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and even her <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> relatives shared in her sufferings from <a href="../cathen/08677a.htm">Knownothing</a> bigotry. In 1863 she became a volunteer <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> nurse, serving in Washington until she grew ill. <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> then became her home. Short stories from her pen appeared in the early numbers of "The Catholic World", where also her first novel "The House of Yorke" was issued as a serial (1871-72). It was followed by "Grapes and Thorns" (1873-74) and "Six Sunny Months" (1876-77). The latter was the first fruit of her sojourn in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (1873-87). These three novels sounded a distinctly new note in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature, and the highest that has ever been struck by an American <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> novelist. "Signor Monaldini's Niece" (1879), in "No Name" series; "By the Tiber" (1881); "The Jewel in the Lotus" (1884); "Aurora" (1885); "The Two Coronets" (1887); "San Salvador" (1889; were issued by the most prominent literary publishers and won her great fame as works of real art. They reflected for the most part the beauty of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. A lapse from the practice of her religion cast its shadow perhaps over a few of her novels written at that time. She returned to her religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> many years before her death. Her last book, fittingly called "Autumn Leaves" (1898) was issued by a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> firm, and contained matter contributed not long before to "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> World".
