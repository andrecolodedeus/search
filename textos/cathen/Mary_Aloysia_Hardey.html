<h1>Mary Aloysia Hardey</h1>  

<p>Of the Society of the Sacred Heart, who established all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of her order, up to the year 1883, in the eastern part of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and Cuba; b. at Piscataway, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, 1809; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 17 June. 1886. Both her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> (Frederick Hardey, Sarah Spalding) were descended from old <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. Mr. Hardey removed to <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, his daughter became (1822) one of the first pupils of the Sacred Heart, Grand Coteau. She entered the order in 1820 and her extraordinary endowments soon justified her appointment (1835) as superioress of St. Michael. Bishop Dubois having invited the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> to New York, Mothers Calitzin and Hardey opened in Houston Street the first Eastern <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> is now located in Aqueduct Avenue. A visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the benediction of <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, and a sojourn with <a href="../cathen/02283a.htm">Mother Barat</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, prepared Mother Hardey for her future work. Thenceforth she was directed in all by the blessed foundress until the death of that holy guide in 1865. Amidst overwhelming labours she maintained that unalterable serenity which was her distinctive trait. She was gifted by nature and grace for immense undertakings; she was of simple manners, her words were few and kind, and she had great power of organization. When asked on her death-bed the number of her foundations, she replied: "I have never counted them, I went where obedience sent me"; that sentence delineates her character and her career. This alphabetic list of thirty <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, of which a few are now closed, represents the toil of more than forty years (from New York, 1841, to Atlantic City, 1883): Albany (New York), Astoria (New York), Atlantic City (New Jersey), <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> (Massachusetts), Buffalo (New York), Cincinnati (Ohio), Clifton (Cincinnati, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>), Detroit (Michigan), Eden Hall (Torresdale, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>), Elmhurst (Rhode Island), Grosse Pointe (Michigan), Halifax (Nova Scotia), Havana (Cuba), Kenwood (Albany, New York), <a href="../cathen/09353a.htm">London (Ontario)</a>, <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (Quebec), McSherrystown (Pennsylvania), Manhattanville (New York), New York City (Aqueduct Avenue, and Madison Avenue), Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Providence (Rhode Island), Rochester (New York), Rosecroft (Maryland), Sancti Spiritus (Cuba), Sandwich (Ontario), Sault-au-Recollet (Montreal), Saint Jacques (Quebec), St. John (New Brunswick), St Vincent (Quebec).

<p>The hardships and perplexities entailed on one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> by all these foundations are hard to realize in these days when travelling is so easy and money so plentiful. Ten voyages to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, five to <a href="../cathen/04558c.htm">Cuba</a>, and constant journeyings as mother provincial or visitatrix forced her to undergo much fatigue and peril. Her paramount concern was not the erection of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> but the formation of fervent religious as <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> teachers, and where the world saw an executive and a benefactress, her communities found simply a vigilant but tender mother, an unfailing friend whose memory they bequeathed as a sacred legacy. The Civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> rent her heart, equally bound to North and South: food, money, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> supplies, provisions for the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>, went wherever suffering appealed. Her name became a household word. With Northern leaders, her influence was exerted on behalf of Southern <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and she herself, passing through contending armies, brought aid to the southwestern houses. Liberal benefactions went to Cuban homes, 1860-70; to <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, after its great fire; to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 1870-71; to the South, when ravaged with fever; in a word, to sorrow and necessity, always and everywhere. She provided twenty-five free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the States and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, beyond computing is the number of young girls <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> gratuitously in her academies; while she delicately assisted many young aspirants to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> to fulfil their vocations. Kenwood, <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, became her residence and the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices'</a> home in 1866 when she erected the buildings which now contain the general <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> for North America.

<p>In 1871 she was appointed assistant general, an office requiring residence in the mother-house, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. She inspected first, as visitatrix, all <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the order in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and embarked for <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in 1872. In the central government, her wisdom and experience there invaluable, while the example of her self-effacing <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> was not less precious. She aided the superiors-general in visitations and foundations of French and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, still supervising those of America. She came back to America on her official visits in 1874, 1878, 1882. Her daughters, who treasured her parting counsels as oracles, bade her a last farewell in 1884, when she returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> as member of the general council. She had spent herself for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the Institute, a severe illness struck her down in 1885, and after months of patient suffering the end came peacefully.

<p>She was buried in Conflans <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the general administrators; but the persecutions of the French government suggesting removal of the <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> dead, her remains were bestowed on the country she had <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> so profoundly and so loyally served. On 12 December, 1900, she was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> at Kenwood, <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, where, on the tablet from Conflans vault, her own order records its testimony to the work she achieved ". . . late per regiones Americae. . . prudentia virtute".
