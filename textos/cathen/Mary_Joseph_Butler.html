<h1>Mary Joseph Butler</h1>  

<p>First <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Our Lady of Grace, at Ypres, <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, b. at Callan, County Kilkenny, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in Dec., 1641; d. at Ypres, 22 Dec., 1723. Sent to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> under the care of her aunt, Lady <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> Knatchbull of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Dames at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, she petitioned, when twelve years old, to be received into the order, a request granted two years later. She made her <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> 4 Nov., 1657 at the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Boulogne, at the age of sixteen. In 1665 the mother-house of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> made another foundation, at Ypres, with Dame Beaumont as <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>, but as the house did not thrive under her auspices, it was decided, upon her death in 1682, to convert the house at Ypres into a national foundation for the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the various houses founded from <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>. Dame Butler accordingly was sent to Ypres in 1683, and, on the death of the second <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>, in 1686, was elected <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Dames of Ypres, 29 August. Soon after her election she was called upon to take a leading part in a new <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> foundation in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, set on foot by King James II. By letters-patent or charter, which is dated in the sixth year of his reign, and still preserved in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Ypres, King James confers upon this his "first and chief Royal Monastery of Gratia Dei", an annuity of one hundred pounds sterling to be paid forever out of his exchequer, and appoints his "well-beloved Dame Mary Butler" first <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>. Her brother was King James's Chief Cupbearer for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, a title hereditary in the Butler <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, as their name implies. Having overcome many difficulties <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> Butler set out for Dublin in the year 1688, and in passing through <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> was presented with her <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> habit to the Queen at Whitehall. Towards the end of the year she arrived in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> capital, and took up her abode in a house in Great Ship Street. Here the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> and regular observance were at once begun and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> opened. About thirty young girls of the first <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> were entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> for their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and no less than eighteen of them expressed a wish to become religious. But the good work was rudely interrupted by the entry of the usurper William's forces into <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, after the battle of the Boyne (1 or 11 July, 1690). The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was sacked by his soldiery, and the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> forced to seek refuge in a neighbouring house, but the church plate and other treasures were saved by the presence of mind of a lay sister, Placida Holmes, who disguised herself in secular clothes, and mingled with the plunderers. On the closing of the Dublin <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, the Duke of Ormonde assured his cousin, <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> Butler, of his special protection, should she consent to remain in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, but she decided to return to Ypres, upon which the duke procured for her, from the Prince of Orange, a passport (still preserved at Ypres) permitting her and her <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> to leave the country without molestation.

<p>On her arrival at Ypres she resumed conventual life in extreme poverty with only a few lay sisters to assist her. So great indeed was their destitution that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> strongly urged her to sell the house and retire whithersoever she pleased, but she would not abandon the work, and her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was rewarded, for at length in the year 1700, she had the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of professing several new subjects (among them two <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> ladies from the French Court) who assisted her in keeping up the choir and regular observance. She continued to govern her flock with much wisdom and discretion until the year 1723, when she died in the sixty-sixth year of her <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>, and the thirty-sixth year of her abbatial dignity. King James II, and more especially his Queen, Mary of <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, were great benefactors and friends of <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> Butler, and of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Ypres, which she saved from extinction and which has survived ever since. It enjoys the distinction of being the only religious house in all the Low Countries which remained standing during the storms of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> and of being the only <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Abbey of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>.
