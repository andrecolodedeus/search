<h1>Mateo Aimerich</h1>  

<p>A learned philologist, born at Bordil, in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 1715; died at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, 1799. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at eighteen, and, having finished his studies, taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in several <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> of his Order. He was subsequently <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of Barcelona and Cervera, and Chancellor of the University of Gandia. He was at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, supervising the printing of some books, when the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> was announced. He went on board ship without a murmur, and thought only of consoling his companions, several of whom were old and infirm. He took up his abode at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, and it was there, in exile, that he composed the works which have won for him a distinguished place among the philologists and critics of the eighteenth century. What is remarkable about his literary labours was that his only help was the public <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, and even that his infirmities often prevented him from consulting. He died, at the age of eighty-four, in sentiments of great <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Gifted with a fine, judicious <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, he united to his vast erudition the faculty of writing Latin with great eloquence and purity. Besides some works of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic philosophy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> works, and discourses, we have from his pen, 1st, "Monina et acta Episcoporum Barcinonencium"; 2d, "Quinti Moderati Censorini de vit&acirc; et morte linguae Paradoxa philologica, criticis nonnullis dissertationibus opposite, asserta, et probata", of which there were but a few copies printed; the book is consequently very rare; 3d, a defense of the preceding work; 4th, "Specimen veteris romanae literaturae deperditae vel adhuc latentis;" 5th, "Novum Lexicon historicum et criticum antiquae romanae literaturae. This work, which is the sequel to the preceding, was the one which made Aimerich's <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>. He left also a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, which was a supplement to his dictionary; and a number of Latin discourses.
