<h1>Mathieu-Nicolas Poillevillain de Cl&eacute;manges</h1>  

<p>(Or CLAMANGES)

<p>A French Humanist and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. in Champagne about 1360; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> between 1434 and 1440. He made his studies in the College of Navarre at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and in 1380 received the degree of Licentiate, later on that of Master of Arts. He studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> under <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a> and Pierre d'Ailly, and received the degree of Bachelor of Theology in 1393. He had begun to lecture at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1391 and was appointed its <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> in 1393, a position he filled until 1395. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was then agitated by the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>, and three methods were proposed to re-establish peace: compromise, concession, and a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. From 1380 to 1394 the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> advocated a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. In 1394 another tendency was manifest; i.e. both <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> and <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a> were held responsible for the continuance of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and their resignations decreed to be the means of obtaining peace. To this end a letter was written to King Charles VI by three of the most learned masters of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, Pierre d'Ailly, Gilles des Champs, and Cl&eacute;manges. The two first prepared the content, to which Cl&eacute;manges gave a Ciceronian elegance of form. The letter was unsuccessful, and the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was ordered to abstain from further discussion. Cl&eacute;manges, forced to resign the rectorship of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, then became canon and dean of Saint-Clodoald (1395), and later on canon and treasurer of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, who admired his Latin style, took him for his secretary in 1397, and he remained at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> until 1408, when he abandoned Benedict because of the latter's conflict with Charles VI. Cl&eacute;manges now retired to the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Valfonds and later to Fontain-du-Bose. In these two retreats he wrote his best treatises, "De Fructu eremi" (dedicated to Pierre d'Ailly), "De Fructu rerum adversarum", "De novis festivitatibus non instituendis", and "De studio theologico", in which latter work he exhibits his dislike for the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> method in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. In 1412 he returned to <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>, and was appointed <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/02358b.htm">Bayeux</a>. His voice was heard successively at the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> (1414), and at <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> (1421), where he defended the "liberties" of the Gallican Church. In 1425 he was teaching rhetoric and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the College of Navarre, where, most probably, he died. Cl&eacute;manges is also credited with the authorship of the work "De corrupto Ecclesiae statu", first edited by Cordatus (possibly Hutten) in 1513, a violent attack on the morality and discipline of the contemporary Church; hence he is sometimes considered a Reformer of the type of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> and <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Hus</a>. Schubert, however, in his book "Ist Nicolaus von Cl&eacute;manges der Verfasser des Buches De corrupto Ecclesiae statu?" (Grossenhain, 1882; Leipzig, 1888) has shown that, although a contemporary, Cl&eacute;manges was not the author of the book. His works were edited in two volumes by J. Lydius, a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> minister of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> (Leyden, 1613). His letters are in d'Achery (below) I, 473 sqq.
