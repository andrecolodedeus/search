<h1>Matteo Ricci</h1>  

<p>Founder of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missions of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/09492a.htm">Macerata</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, 6 Oct. 1552; d. at Peking, 11 May, 1610.

<p>Ricci made his classical studies in his native town, studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for two years, and on 15 Aug., 1571, entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at the Roman College, where he made his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies. While there he also devoted his attention to mathematics, <a href="../cathen/04413a.htm">cosmology</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a> under the direction of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/04009a.htm">Father Christopher Clavius</a>. In 1577 he asked to be sent on the missions in Farthest <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, and his request being granted he embarked at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, 24 March, 1578. Arriving at <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>, the capital of the Portuguese Indies, on 13 Sept. of this year, he was employed there and at <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a> in teaching and the ministry until the end of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, 1582, when Father Alessandro Valignani (who had been his novice-master at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> but who since August, 1573, was in charge of all the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missions in the East Indies) summoned him to <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a> to prepare to enter <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. Father Ricci arrived at <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a> on 7 August, 1582.
<h2>Beginning of the mission</h2>

<p>In the sixteenth century nothing remained of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities founded in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> missionaries in the seventh century and by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in the thirteenth and fourteenth (see <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">CHINA</a>). Moreover it is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether the native Chinese population was ever seriously affected by this ancient evangelisation. For those desiring to resume the work everything therefore remained to be done, and the obstacles were greater than formerly. After the death of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> (27 November, 1552) many fruitless attempts had been made. The first missionary to whom Chinese barriers were temporarily lowered was the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Melchior Nu&ntilde;ez Barreto, who twice went as far as Canton, where he spent a month each time (1555). A <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Father Gaspar da Cruz, was also admitted to Canton for a month, but he also had to refrain from "forming a Christian Christianity". Still others, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Augustinians, and Fransciscans in 1568, 1575, 1579, and 1582 touched on Chinese soil, only to be forced, sometimes with ill treatment, to withdraw. To Father Valignani is due the credit of having seen what prevented all these undertakings from having lasting results. The attempts had hitherto been made haphazard, with men insufficiently prepared and incapable of profiting by favourable circumstances had they encountered them. Father Valignani substituted the methodical attack with previous careful selection of missionaries who, the field once open, would implant <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> there. To this end he first summoned to Macao Father Michele de Ruggieri, who had also come to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 1578. Only twenty years had elapsed since the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> had succeeded in establishing their colony at the portals of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, and the Chinese, attracted by opportunities for gain, were flocking thither. Ruggieri reached Macao in July, 1579, and, following the given orders applied himself wholly to the study of the Mandarin language, that is, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a>, as it is spoken throughout the empire by the officials and the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>. His progress, though very slow, permitted him to labour with more fruit than his predecessors in two sojourns at Canton (1580-81) allowed him by an unwonted complacency of the mandarins. Finally, after many untoward events, he was authorized (10 Sept., 1583) to take up his residence with Father Ricci at Chao-k'ing, the administrative capital of Canton.
<h2>Method of the missionaries</h2>

<p>The exercise of great <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> alone enabled the missionaries to remain in the region which they had had such difficulty in entering. Omitting all mention at first of their intention to preach the Gospel, they declared to the mandarins who questioned them concerning their object "that they were religious who had left their country in the distant West because of the renown of the good government of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, where they desired to remain till their death, serving god, the Lord of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>". Had they immediately declared their intention to preach a new religion, they would never have been received; this would have clashed with Chinese <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, which would not admit that <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> had anything to learn from foreigners, and it would have especially alarmed their politics, which beheld a national danger in every innovation. However, the missionaries never hid their Faith nor the fact that they were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. As soon as they were established at Chao-k'ing they placed in a conspicuous part of their house a picture of the Blessed Virgin with the Infant <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in her arms. Visitors seldom failed to inquire the meaning of this, to them, novel representation, and the missionaries profited thereby to give them a first <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The missionaries assumed the initiative in speaking of their religion as soon as they had sufficiently overcome Chinese antipathy and distrust to see their instructions desired, or at least to be certain of making them understood without shocking their listeners. They achieved this result by appealing to the curiosity of the Chinese, by making them feel, without saying so, that the foreigners had something new and interesting to teach; to this end they made use of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> things they had brought with them. Such were large and small clocks, mathematical and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> instruments, prisms revealing the various colours, musical instruments, oil <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> and prints, cosmographical, geographical, and <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> works with diagrams, maps, and views of towns and buildings, large volumes, magnificently printed and splendidly bound, etc.

<p>The Chinese, who had hitherto fancied that outside of their country only barbarism existed, were astounded. Rumours of the wonders displayed by the religious from the West soon spread on all sides, and thenceforth their house was always filled, especially with mandarins and the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>. It followed, says Father Ricci, that "all came by degrees to have with regard to our countries, our people, and especially of our <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> men, an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> vastly different from that which they had hitherto entertained". This impression was intensified by the explanations of the missionaries concerning their little museum in reply to the numerous questions of their visitors.

<p>One of the articles which most aroused their curiosity was a map of the world. The Chinese had already had maps, called by their geographers "descriptions of the world", but almost the entire space was filled by the fifteen provinces of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, around which were <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a bit of sea and a few islands on which were inscribed the names of countries of which they had heard &#151; all together was not as large as a small Chinese province. Naturally the learned men of Chao-k'ing immediately protested when Father Ricci pointed out the various parts of the world on the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> map and when they saw how small a part <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> played. But after the missionaries had explained its construction and the care taken by the geographers of the West to assign to each country its actual position and boundaries, the wisest of them surrendered to the evidence, and beginning with the Governor of Chao-k'ing, all urged the missionary to make a copy of his map with the names and inscriptions in Chinese. Ricci drew a larger map of the world on which he wrote more detailed inscriptions, suited to the needs of the Chinese; when the work was completed the governor had it printed, giving all the copies as presents to his friends in the province and at a distance. Father Ricci does not hesitate to say: "This was the most useful work that could be done at that time to dispose <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> to give credence to the things of our holy Faith. . . . Their conception of the greatness of their country and of the insignificance of all other lands made them so proud that the w hole world seemed to them savage and barbarous compared with themselves; it was scarcely to be expected that they, while entertaining this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, would heed foreign masters." But now numbers were eager to learn of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> affairs from the missionaries, who profited by these dispositions to introduce religion more frequently with their explanations. For example, their beautiful Bibles and the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> and prints depicting religious subjects, monuments, <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, etc., gave them an opportunity of speaking of "the good customs in the countries of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falseness</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, of the conformity of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a> with natural reason and similar teachings found in the writings of the ancient sages of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>". This last instance shows that Father Ricci already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to draw from his Chinese studies testimony favourable to the religion which he was to preach.



<p>It was soon evident to the missionaries that their remarks regarding religion were no less interesting to many of their visitors than their Western curiosities and learning, and, to satisfy those who wished to learn more, they distributed leaflets containing a Chinese translation of the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">Ten Commandments</a>, an abbreviation of the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> code much appreciated by the Chinese, composed a small <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> in which the chief points of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> were explained in a dialogue between a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> and a <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. This work, printed about 1584, was also well received, the highest mandarins of the province considering themselves <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> to receive it as a present. The missionaries distributed hundreds and thousands of copies and thus "the good odour of our Faith began to be spread throughout <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>". Having begun their direct apostolate in this manner, they furthered it not a little by their edifying regular life, their disinterestedness, their charity, and their patience under persecutions which often destroyed the fruits of their labours.
<h2>Development of the missions</h2>

<p>Father Ricci played the chief part in these early attempts to make <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> known to the Chinese. In 1607 Father Ruggieri died in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, where he had been sent in 1588 by Father Valignani to interest the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> more particularly in the missions. Left alone with a young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, a pupil rather than an assistant, Ricci was expelled from Chao-k'ing in 1589 by a viceroy of Canton who had found the house of the missionaries suited to his own needs; but the mission had taken root too deeply to be exterminated by the ruin of its first home. Thenceforth in whatever town Ricci sought a new field of apostolate he was preceded by his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> and he found powerful friends to protect him. He first went to Shao-chow, also in the province of Canton, where he dispensed with the services of interpreters and adopted the costume of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> Chinese. In 1595 he made an attempt on Nan-king, the famous capital in the south of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, and, though unsuccessful, it furnished him with an opportunity of forming a <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> at Nan-ch'ang, capital of Kiang-si, which was so famous for the number and learning of its <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> men. In 1598 he made a bold but equally fruitless attempt to establish himself at Peking. Forced to return to Nan-king on 6 Feb., 1599, he found Providential compensation there; the situation had changed completely since the preceding year, and the highest mandarins were desirous of seeing the holy doctor from the West take up his abode in their city. Although his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> was rewarded with much success in this wider field, he constantly longed to repair his repulse at Peking. He felt that the mission was not secure in the provinces until it was established and authorized in the capital. On 18 May, 1600, Ricci again set out for Peking and, when all human hope of success was lost, he entered on 24 January, 1601, summoned by Emperor Wan-li.
<h2>Last labours</h2>

<p>Ricci's last nine years were spent at Peking, strengthening his work with the same wisdom and tenacity of purpose which had conducted it so far. The imperial goodwill was gained by gifts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> curiosities, especially the map of the world, from which the <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> ruler learned for the first time the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> situation of his empire and the existence of so many other different kingdoms and peoples; he required Father Ricci to make a copy of it for him in his palace. At Peking, as at Nan-king and elsewhere, the interest of the most intelligent Chinese was aroused chiefly by the revelations which the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> teacher made to them in the domain of the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, even those in which they considered themselves most proficient. Mathematics and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, for example, had from time immemorial formed a part of the institutions of the <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> Government, but, when they listened to Father Ricci, even the men who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> most had to acknowledge how small and how mingled with <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> was their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. But this recognition of their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and their esteem for <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> learning, of which they had just got a glimpse, impelled very few Chinese to make serious efforts to acquire this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, their attachment to tradition or the routine of national teaching being too deep-rooted. However, the Chinese governors, who even at the present day have made no attempt at reform in this matter, did not wish to deprive the country of all the advantages of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> discoveries. To procure them recourse had to be had to the missionaries, and thus the Chinese mission from Ricci's time until the end of the eighteenth century found its chief protection in the services performed with the assistance of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> learning. Father Ricci made use of profane <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> only to prepare the ground and open the way to the apostolate properly so called. With this object in view he employed other means, which made a deep impression on the majority of the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> class, and especially on those who held public offices. He composed under various forms adapted to the Chinese taste little moral treatises, e.g., that called by the Chinese "The Twenty-five Words", because in twenty-five short chapters it treated "of the <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> of the passions and the nobility of virtue". Still greater admiration was aroused by the "Paradoxes", a collection of practical sentences, useful to a moral life, familiar to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> but new to the Chinese, which Ricci developed with accounts of examples, comparisons, and extracts from the Scriptures and from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>. Not unreasonably proud of their rich moral literature, the Chinese were greatly surprised to see a stranger succeed so well; they could not refrain from praising his exalted <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, and the respect which they soon acquired for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writings did much to dissipate their distrust of strangers and to render them kindly disposed towards the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>.

<p>But the book through which Ricci exercised the widest and most fortunate influence was his "T'ien-chu-she-i" (The True Doctrine of God). This was the little <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> of Chao-k'ing which had been delivered from day to day, corrected and improved as occasion offered, until it finally contained all the matter suggested by long years of experience in the apostolate. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which must be admitted as the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> preliminary to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> &#151; the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence</a> and unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the creation, the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, reward or punishment in a future life &#151; are here demonstrated by the best arguments from reason, while the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> most widespread in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, especially the worship of idols and the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the transmigration of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, are successfully refuted. To the testimony furnished by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> Ricci added numerous <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from the ancient Chinese books which did much to win credit for his work. A masterpiece of <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a> and controversy, the "T'ien-chu-she-i", rightfully became the manual of the missionaries and did most effacacious missionary work. Before its author's death it had been reprinted at least four times, and twice by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>. It led countless numbers to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and aroused esteem for our religion in those readers whom it did not convert. The perusal of it induced Emperor K'ang-hi to issue his edict of 1692 granting liberty to preach the Gospel. The Emperor Kien-long, although he <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, ordered the "T'ien-chu-she-i" to be placed in his <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> with his collection of the most notable productions of the Chinese language. Even to the present time missionaries have experienced its beneficent influence, which was not confined to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, being felt also in <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, Tong-king, and other countries tributary to Chinese literature.

<p>Besides the works intended especially for the infidels and the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> whose initiation was in progress, Father Ricci wrote others for the new <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. As founder of the mission he had to invent formulae capable of expressing clearly and unequivocally our <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> and rites in a language which had hitherto never been put to such use (except for the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> use, with which Ricci was not acquainted). It was a delicate and difficult task, but it formed only a part of the heavy burden which the direction of the mission was for Father Ricci, particularly during his last years. While advancing gradually on the capital Ricci did not abandon the territory already conquered; he trained in his methods the fellow-workers who joined him and commissioned them to continue his work in the cities he left. Thus in 1601, the mission included, besides Peking, the three residences of Nan-king, Nan-ch'ang, Shao-chow, to which was added in 1608 that of Shang-hai. In each of these there were two or three missionaries with "brothers", <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a> who had been received into the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and who served the mission as catechists. Although as yet the number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was not very great (2000 <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in 1608), Father Ricci in his "Memoirs" has said well that considering the obstacles to the entrance of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> into <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> the result was "a very great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">Divine Omnipotence</a>". To preserve and increase the success already obtained, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the means which had already <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> efficacious should continue to be employed; everywhere and always the missionaries, without neglecting the essential <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> apostolate, had to adapt their methods to the special conditions of the country, and avoid unnecessary attacks on traditional customs and habits. The application of this undeniably sound policy was often difficult. In answer to the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> of his fellow-workers Father Ricci outlined rules, which received the approval of Father Valignano; these insured the unity and fruitful efficacy of the apostolic work throughout the mission.
<h2>Question of the divine names and the Chinese rites</h2>

<p>The most difficult problem in the evangelization of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> had to do with the rites or ceremonies, in use from time immemorial, to do <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to ancestors or deceased relatives and the particular tokens of respect which the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> felt bound to pay to their master, <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a>. Ricci's solution of this problem caused a long and heated controversy in which the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> finally decided against him. The discussion also dealt with the use of the Chinese terms <em>T'ien</em> (<a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>) and <em>Shang-ti</em> (Sovereign Lord) to designate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; here also the custom established by Father Ricci had to be corrected. The following is a short history of this famous controversy which was singularly complicated and embittered by passion. With regard to the designations for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Ricci always preferred, and employed from the first, the term <em>T'ien chu</em> (Lord of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>) for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; as had been seen, he used it in the title of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>. But in studying the most ancient Chinese books he considered it established that they said of <em>T'ien</em> (<a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>) and <em>Shang-ti</em> (Sovereign Lord) what we say of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a>, that is, they described under these two names a sovereign lord of spirits and men who knows all that takes place in the world, the source of all power and all lawful authority, the supreme regulator and defender of the moral law, rewarding those who observe and punishing those who violate it. Hence he concluded that, in the most revered monuments of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, <em>T'ien</em> and <em>Shang'ti</em> designate nothing else than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a> whom he himself preached. Ricci maintained this opinion in several passages of his <em>T'ien-chu-she-i</em>; it will be readily understood of what assistance it was to destroy Chinese prejudices against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that, in drawing this conclusion, Ricci had to contradict the common interpretation of modern scholars who follow Chu-Hi in referring <em>T'ien</em> and <em>Shang-ti</em> to apply to the material <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; but he showed that this material interpretation does not do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to the texts and it is at least reasonable to see in them something better. In fact he informs us that the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucianists</a>, who did not adore idols, were grateful to him for interpreting the words of their master with such goodwill. Indeed, Ricci's opinion has been adopted and confirmed by illustrious modern Sinologists, amongst whom it suffices to mention James Legge ("The Notions of the Chinese concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Spirits", 1852; "A Letter to Prof. Max Muller chiefly on the Translation of the Chinese terms Ti and Chang-ti", 1880).

<p>Therefore it was not without serious grounds that the founder of the Chinese mission and his successors believed themselves justified in employing the terms <em>T'ien</em> and <em>Shang-ti</em> as well as <em>T'ien-chu</em> to designate the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a>. However, there were objections to this practice even among the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the earliest rising shortly after the death of Father Ricci and being formulated by the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. In the ensuing discussion carried on in various writings for and against, which did not circulate beyond the circle of the missionaries only one of those working in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> declared himself against the use of the name <em>Shang-ti</em>. This was Father Nicholas Longobardi, Ricci's successor as superior general of the mission, who, however, did not depart in anything from the lines laid down by its founder. After allowing the question to be discussed for some years, the superior ordered the missionaries to abide simply by the custom of Father Ricci; later this custom together with the rites was submitted to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In 1704 and 1715 <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, without pronouncing as to the meaning of <em>T'ien</em> and <em>Shang-ti</em> in the ancient Chinese books, forbade, as being open to misconstruction, the use of these names to indicate the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a>, and permitted only the <em>T'ien-chu</em>. Regarding the rites and ceremonies in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of ancestors and <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a>, Father Ricci was also of the opinion that a broad toleration was permissible without injury to the purity of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. Moreover, the question was of the utmost importance for the progress of the apostolate. To <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> their ancestors and deceased <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> by traditional prostrations and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> was in the eyes of the Chinese the gravest <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of filial <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and one who neglected it was treated by all his relatives as an unworthy member of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and nation. Similar ceremonies in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a> were an indispensable <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> for scholars, so that they could not receive any literary degree nor claim any public office without having fulfilled it. This law still remains inviolable; Kiang-hi, the emperor who showed most goodwill towards the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, always refused to set it aside in their favour. In modern times the <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> Government showed no more favour to the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, who, in the name of the treaties guaranteeing the liberty of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, claimed for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who had passed the examinations, the titles and advantages of the corresponding degrees without the necessity of going through the ceremonies; the Court of Peking invariably replied that this was a question of national tradition on which it was impossible to compromise.

<p>After having carefully studied what the Chinese classical books said regarding these rites, and after having observed for a long time the practice of them and questioned numerous scholars of every rank with whom he was associated during this eighteen years of apostolate, Ricci was convinced that these rites had no religious significance, either in their institution or in their practice by the enlightened classes. The Chinese, he said, recognized no divinity in <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a> any more than in their deceased ancestors; they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to neither; the made no requests nor expected any extraordinary intervention from them. In fact they only did for them what they did for the living to whom they wished to show great respect. "The <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> they pay to their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> consists in serving them dead as they did living. They do not for this reason think that the dead come to eat their offerings [the flesh, fruit, etc.] or need them. They declare that they act in this manner because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no other way of showing their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and gratitude to their ancestors. . . . Likewise what they do [especially the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>], they do to thank <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a> for the excellent <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which he left them in his books, and through which they obtained their degrees and mandarinships. Thus in all this there is nothing suggestive of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, and perhaps it may even be said that there is no <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>." The "perhaps" added to the last part of this conclusion shows the conscientiousness with which the founder acted in this matter. That the vulgar and indeed even most of the <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> mingled <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> with their national rites Ricci never denied; neither did he overlook the fact that the Chinese, like infidels in general, mixed <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> with their most legitimate actions. In such cases <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> is only an accident which does not corrupt the substance of the just action itself, and Ricci thought this applied also to the rites. Consequently he allowed the new <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to continue the practice of them avoiding everything suggestive of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, and he gave them rules to assist them to discriminate. He believed, however, that this tolerance, though licit, should be limited by the necessity of the case; whenever the <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community should enjoy sufficient liberty, its customs, notably its manner of honouring the dead, must be brought into conformity with the customs of the rest of the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a>. These principles of Father Ricci, controlled by his fellow-workers during his lifetime, and after his death, served for fifty years as the guide of all the missionaries.

<p>In 1631 the first mission of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> was founded at Fu-kien by two <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> religious; in 1633 two <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, also Spanish, came to establish a mission of their order. The new missionaries were soon alarmed by the attacks on the purity of religion which they thought they discerned in the communities founded by their predecessors. Without taking sufficient time perhaps to become acquainted with Chinese matters and to learn exactly what was done in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missions they sent a denunciation to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> referred it to <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a> (1635), and soon the public was informed. As early as 1638 a controversy began in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> between the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in defence of their brethren on the one side and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> on the other. In 1643 one of the chief accusers, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Jean-Baptiste Moralez, went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to submit to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> a series of "questions" or "doubts" which he said were controverted between the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries and their rivals. Ten of these questions concerned the participation of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the rites in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a> and the dead. Moralez's petition tended to show that the cases on which he requested the decision of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> represented the practice authorized by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>; as soon as the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> learned of this they declared that these cases were imaginary and that they had never allowed the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to take part in the rites as set forth by Moralez. In declaring the ceremonies illicit in its <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 12 Sept., 1645 (approved by <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a>), the congregation of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> gave the only possible reply to the questions referred to it.

<p>In 1651 Father Martin Martini (author of the "Novus Atlas Sienensis") was sent from <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by his brethren to give a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> account of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> practices and permissions with regard to the Chinese rites. This delegate reached the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a> in 1654, and in 1655 submitted four questions to the Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office. This supreme tribunal, in its <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 23 March, 1656, approved by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Pope Alexander VII</a>, sanctioned the practice of Ricci and his associates as set forth by Father Martini, declaring that the ceremonies in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a> and ancestors appeared to constitute "a purely civil and political cult". Did this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> annul that of 1645? Concerning this question, laid before the Holy Office by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Father John de Polanco, the reply was (20 Nov., 1669) that both decrees should remain "in their full force" and should be observed "according to the questions, circumstances, and everything contained in the proposed <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a>".

<p>Meanwhile an understanding was reached by the hitherto divided missionaries. This reconciliation was hastened by the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of 1665 which assembled for nearly five years in the same house at Canton nineteen <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, three <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and one <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> (then the sole member of his order in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>). Profiting by their enforced leisure to agree on a uniform Apostolic method, the missionaries discussed all the points on which the <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a> should be adapted to the exigencies of the Chinese situation. After forty days of conferences, which terminated on 26 Jan., 1668, all (with the possible exception of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Antonio de Santa Maria, who was very <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> but extremely uncompromising) subscribed to forty-two articles, the result of the deliberations, of which the forty-first was as follows: "As to the ceremonies by which the <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> their master <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a> and the dead, the replies of the Sacred Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> approved by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">our Holy Father Alexander VII</a>, in 1656, must be followed absolutely because they are based on a very probable opinion, to which it is impossible to offset any evidence to the contrary, and, this probability assumed, the door of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> must not be closed to the innumerable Chinese who would stray from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> if they were forbidden to what they may do licitly and in <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> and which they cannot forego without serious injury." After the subscription, however, a new courteous discussion of this article in writing took place between <a href="../cathen/10723a.htm">Father Domingo Fernandez Navarrete</a>, superior of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and the most learned of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at Canton. <a href="../cathen/10723a.htm">Navarrette</a> finally appeared satisfied and on 29 Sept., 1669, submitted his written acceptance of the article to the superior of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. However, on 19 Dec. of this year he secretly left Canton for Macao whence he went to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. There, and especially at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where he was in 1673, he sought from now on only to overthrow what had been attempted in the conferences of Canton. He published the "Tratados historicos, politicos, ethicos, y religiosos de la monarchia de China" (I, <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 1673; of vol. II, printed in 1679 and incomplete, only two copies are known). This work is filled with impassioned accusations against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries regarding their methods of apostolate and especially their toleration of the rites. Nevertheless, Naverrette did not succeed in inducing the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to resume the question, this being reserved for Charles Maigrot, a member of the new Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des Missions &Eacute;trang&egrave;res. Maigrot went to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in 1683. He was <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Fu-kien, before being as yet a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, when, on 26 March, 1693, he addressed to the missionaries of his vicariate a mandate proscribing the names <em>T'ien</em> and <em>Shang-ti</em>; forbidding that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> be allowed to participate in or assist at "sacrifices or solemn oblations" in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a> or the dead; prescribing modifications of the inscriptions on the ancestral tablets; censuring and forbidding certain, according to him, too favourable references to the ancient <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>; and, last but not least, declaring that the exposition made by Father Martini was not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and that consequently the approval which the latter had received from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was not to be relied on.

<p>By order of <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a>, the Holy Office resumed in 1697 the study of the question on the documents furnished by the procurators of Mgr Maigrot and on those showing the opposite side brought by the representatives of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries. It is worthy of note that at this period a number of the missionaries outside the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, especially all the Augustinians, nearly all the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and some <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, were converted to the practice of Ricci and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries. The difficulty of grasping the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> amid such different representations of facts and contradictory interpretations of texts prevented the Congregation from reaching a decision until towards the end of 1704 under the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>. Long before then the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had chosen and sent to the Far East a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to secure the execution of the Apostolic decrees and to regulate all other questions on the welfare of the missions. The <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> chosen was Charles-Thomas-Maillard de Tournon (b. at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>) whom <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> had <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> with his own hands on 27 Dec., 1701, and on whom he conferred the title of <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. Leaving <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> on 9 Feb., 1703, Mgr de Tournon stayed for a time in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> (see <a href="../cathen/09558b.htm">MALABAR RITES</a>) reaching Macao on 2 April, 1705, and Peking on 4 December of the same year. Emperor K'ang-hi accorded him a warm welcome and treated him with much <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> until he learned, perhaps through the imprudence of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> himself, that one of the objects of his embassy, if not the chief, was to abolish the rites amongst the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Mgr de Tournon was already aware that the decision against the rites had been given since 20 Nov., 1704, but not yet published in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> wished that it should be published first in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. Forced to leave Peking, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> had returned to Nan-king when he learned that the emperor had ordered all missionaries, under penalty of expulsion, to come to him for a <em>piao</em> or diploma granting permission to preach the Gospel. This diploma was to be granted only to those who promised not to oppose the national rites. On the receipt of this news the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> felt that he could no longer postpone the announcement of the Roman decisions. By a mandate of 15 January, 1707, he required all missionaries under pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> to reply to Chinese authority, if it questioned them, that "several things" in Chinese <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and customs did not agree with <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> and that these were chiefly "the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a> and ancestors" and "the use of ancestral tablets", moreover that <em>Shang-ti</em> and "T'ien" were not "the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>". When the emperor learned of this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> he ordered Mgr de Tournon to be brought to Macao and forbade him to leave there before the return of the envoys whom he himself sent to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to explain his objections to the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdiction</a> of the rites. While still subject to this restraint, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> died in 1710.

<p>Meanwhile Mgr Maigrot and several other missionaries having refused to ask for the <em>piao</em> had been expelled from <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. But the majority (i.e. all the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, most of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and other missionary religious, having at their head the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Peking, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a>, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Kiang-si, an Augustinian) considered that, to prevent the total ruin of the mission, they might postpone obedience to the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> until the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should have signified his will. <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> replied by publishing (March, 1709) the answers of the Holy Office, which he had already approved on 20 November, 1704, and then by causing the same Congregation to issue (25 Sept., 1710) a new <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> which approved the acts of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> and ordered the observance of the mandate of Nan-king, but interpreted in the sense of the Roman replies of 1704, omitting all the questions and most of the preambles, and concluded with a form of <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> enjoined on all the missionaries and which <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> them under the severest penalties to observe and have observed fully and without reserve the decisions inserted in the pontifical act. This Constitution, which reached <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> in 1716, found no rebels among the missionaries, but even those who sought most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> failed to induce the majority of their flock to observe its provisions. At the same time the hate of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> was reawakened, enkindled by the old charge that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was the enemy of the national rites, and the <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> began to be the objects of persecutions to which K'ang-hi, hitherto so well-disposed, now gave almost entire liberty. <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> sought to remedy this critical situation by sending to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> a second <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, John-Ambrose Mezzabarba, whom he named <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>. This <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> sailed from <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> on 25 March, 1720, reaching Macao on 26 September, and Canton on 12 October. Admitted, not without difficulty, to Peking and to an audience with the emperor, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> could only prevent his immediate dismissal and the expulsion of all the missionaries by making known some alleviations of the Constitution "Ex ill&acirc; die", which he was authorized to offer, and allowing K'ang-hi to hope that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> would grant still others. Then he hastened to return to <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a>, whence he addressed (4 November, 1721) a pastoral letter to the missionaries of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, communicating to them the authentic text of his eight "permissions" relating to the rites. He declared that he would permit nothing forbidden by the Constitution; in practice, however, his concessions relaxed the rigour of the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">pontifical interdictions</a>, although they did not produce harmony or unity of action among the apostolic workers. To bring about this highly desirable result the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ordered a new investigation, the chief object of which was the legitimacy and opportuneness of Mezzabarba's "permissions"; begun by the Holy Office under <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> a conclusion was reached only under <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>. On 11 July, 1742, this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ex quo singulari", confirmed and reimposed in a most emphatic manner the Constitution "Ex ill&acirc; die", and condemned and annulled the "permissions" of Mezzabarba as authorizing the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a> which that Constitution sought to destroy. This action terminated the controversy among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> did not touch on the purely theoretical questions, as for instance what the Chinese rites were and signified according to their institution and in ancient times. In this Father Ricci may have been right; but he was mistaken in thinking that as practised in modern times they are not <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> or can be made free from all <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> declared, after scrupulous investigations, that the ceremonies in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/04223b.htm">Confucius</a> or ancestors and deceased relatives are tainted with <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> to such a degree that they cannot be purified. But the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Ricci, as of his fellow-workers and successors, was but an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in judgment. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> expressly forbade it to be said that they approved of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; it would indeed be an odious <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> to accuse such a man as Ricci, and so many other holy and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> missionaries, of having approved and permitted their <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> practices which they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a> and contrary to the purity of religion. Despite this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, Matto Ricci remains a splendid type of missionary and founder, unsurpassed for his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> intrepidity, the intelligence of the methods applied to each situation, and the unwearying tenacity with which he pursued the projects he undertook. To him belongs the glory not only of opening up a vast empire to the Gospel, but of simultaneously making the first breach in that distrust of strangers which excluded <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> from the general progress of the world. The establishment of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mission in the heart of this country also had its <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> consequences: it laid the foundation of a better understanding between the Far East and the West, which grew with the progress of the mission. It is superfluous to detail the results from the standpoint of the material interests of the whole world. Lastly, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> owes to Father Ricci the first exact scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> received in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> geographical situation, its ancient civilization, its vast and curious literature, its social organization so different from what existed elsewhere. The method instituted by Ricci necessitated a fundamental study of this new world, and if the missionaries who have since followed him have rendered scarcely less service to <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> than to religion, a great part of the credit is due to Ricci.
