<h1>Matthew of Bassi</h1>  

<p>Founder and first Superior-General of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Order of Friars Minor Capuchins</a>, the principal branch issued from the Reform of the Observance, b. in 1495, at Bascio, <a href="../cathen/10528a.htm">Diocese of Montefeltro</a>, in the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1552. At the age of seventeen he entered the Order of the Observants at Montefiorentino. In 1525 he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and missionary, being a member of the Reformed Province of <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>. Moved by the need for reform which was felt almost all through the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan family</a>, he resolved, in 1525, the year of the Jubilee, to begin a more austere life, choosing a form of garb more resembling that of St. Francis. <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> granted his request and also permitted him to preach everywhere and to have a companion. Some other members of the Observance asked and obtained permission to join him, and on the 3d of July, 1528, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> issued the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Religionis zelus", by which the new Reform was canonically approved and placed under the nominal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>. The name "Capuchin", at first given by the people to the new <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, was afterwards officially adopted. In the pontifical decrees Bassi's followers are variously style "Capucini", "Capuciati", "Capulati", and "Fratres de Observanti&acirc; Capucinorum".

<p>In April, 1529, the new order held its first chapter at Albacina, where Matthew of Bassi was elected <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> by acclamation. A code of constitutions which was to serve as a basis to the Reform was elaborated. But the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> founder did not hold his charge very long. After visiting his brethren, wishing to resume his apostolic career, and perhaps feeling powerless against the difficulties which menaced his disciples, he resigned his office. Thenceforward he took no part in the government of the order. He even decided, about 1537, to return to the obedience of the Observants, through fear of incurring some <a href="../cathen/03527a.htm">ecclesiastical censure</a>. As it was, these last had obtained, at different times, <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> or Decrees against the new Reform. Bassi preached through the whole of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and part of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He died at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, in the midst of his labours, and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Observants of that city in the presence of a vast concourse of people attracted by his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> as a saint. The following eulogy by Arthur du Monstier is read in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Martyrologium under the 3d of August: "There died at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, Blessed Matthew, confessor, founder of the congregation of <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. His continual fastings, vigils and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, his most high poverty and ardent <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, lastly his extraordinary <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">gift of miracles</a> made his memory glorious".
