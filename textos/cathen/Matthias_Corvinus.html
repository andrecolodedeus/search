<h1>Matthias Corvinus</h1>  

<p>King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, son of <a href="../cathen/07564b.htm">Janos Hunyady</a> and Elizabeth Szilagyi of Horogssey, was born at Kolozsvar 23 Feb., 1440; d. at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 6 April, 1490. In the house of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> he received along with his brother Ladislaus, a careful <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> under the supervision of Gregor Sanocki, who taught him the humanities. Johann Vitez, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07040a.htm">Grosswardein</a> from 1445, the friend of Matthias's father when a boy, and himself an enthusiastic patron and promoter of classical studies, had a decided influence on his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The checkered career of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> likewise left its imprint on the life of Matthias. On political grounds he was <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> in 1455 to Elizabeth, the daughter of Count Ulric Czilley, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> deadly enemy, with the aim of effecting the reconciliation of the two <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. The early death of Elizabeth interfered with this plan, and after the death of <a href="../cathen/07564b.htm">Janos Hunyady</a>, Czilley's emnity was directed against the sons. At the instigation of Czilley and his accomplices, who accused Ladislaus and Matthias Hunyadi of a conspiracy against King Ladislaus V, both were arrested, Ladislaus being executed, and Matthias being taken to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> to the court of the king. Later he followed the king to Prague. After the death of King Ladislaus at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, Matthias settled down at the court of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> king, George Podiebrad, who <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> him to his daughter Catharine. On 23 Jan., 1458, Matthias was proclaimed King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> at Buda, his uncle Michael Szilagyi at the same time being appointed governor for five years. Matthias soon freed himself, however, from the regency of Szilagyi, and took the reins of government into his own hands. At the very beginning of his reign he had to contend with a movement among discontented Hungarians, who offered the crown to the Emperor Frederick III, who had assumed the title of King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. The quarrel with Frederick lasted till 1462, when an agreement was made by which, among other things, it was settled that if Matthias should die without leaving an heir, Frederick would be authorized to bear the title of King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> as long as he lived. At the same time, Frederick adopted Matthias as his son, and pledged himself to deliver up the Hungarian crown which he had in his possession. The treaty was confirmed by the Hungarian Reichstag and Matthias was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> king in 1463. Not long before he had married Catharine, the daughter of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> king Podiebrad, who, however, died at the beginning of 1464. Relations with the Emperor Frederick again became strained; political conditions and, in particular, the question of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> crown, affected them considerably. The friction between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and King Podiebrad led to the deposition of the latter, and Matthias was now called upon by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to take up arms against the deposed king. In 1468 came the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> expedition of Matthias, elected king by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> continued till the death of Podiebrad in 1471, when the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>, defeating Matthias, chose Wladislaw, son of Casimir, King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, as king. The years up to 1474 were marked by indecisive battles with the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> king and with the Emperor Frederick. An armistice caused a brief cessation of hostilities, but from 1476 relations with the Emperor Frederick grew continually more strained. In 1477 Matthias, invading <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, besieged <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. Peace was effected between Matthias and Frederick by the intervention of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> in 1477, but <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> soon broke out again, and in 1485 Matthias took <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Emperor Frederick, Matthias had in view the Roman crown. In this connexion he was led not merely by the aim of securing for <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> a leading position in the West of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, but also by the design to unite the powers of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a>, however, to abandon this scheme. Equally fruitless was the plan of a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>; nevertheless he managed to fix a limit to the advance of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and to strengthen the supremacy of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> over Bosnia. In 1463 Bosnia fell again into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. The victory of Matthias over the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in <a href="../cathen/13732a.htm">Servia</a>, <a href="../cathen/02694a.htm">Bosnia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> resulted in 1483 in a truce with the Sultan Bajazet. Matthias's relations with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church were good till the year 1471; but the second part of his reign was marked by a series of most serious blunders and acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. In spite of legal enactments, he gave <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> to foreigners, and rewarded political services with gifts of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, which he dealt with as though it were the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the state. His relations with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> were at first decidedly cordial, but later there was danger of a rupture, which was happily avoided. Under Matthias the humanities made their entry into <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. His <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> in Buda, the <em>Bibliotheca Corviniana</em>, wins just admiration even today by virtue of the remnants of it scattered over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. During his reign the first printing press in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> was established, that at Buda, the first known production of which is the "Chronicle of Buda", printed in 1473. The arts too, found in Matthias a generous Maecenas. Matthias introduced reforms in the army, in finance, and in the administration of the courts and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. The reorganization of military affairs was based on the principle of a standing army. With this body, the so-called black troops, he defeated the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and the Hussite troops of Giskra, which were laying waste Upper <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. In financial affairs, a reform in the mode of taxation was introduced, while his enactments in judicial affairs earned for him among the people the title of "The Just". In 1476 he married Beatrice, the daughter of the King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, but the union was childless. His exertions to secure the throne for his <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> son, Johann Corvinus, were rendered futile by the opposition of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and the plotting of Beatrice. Matthias was buried at Szekes-Fehervar (Stuhlweissenburg).
