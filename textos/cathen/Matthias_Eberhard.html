<h1>Matthias Eberhard</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, b. 15 Nov., 1815, at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> (Germany), d. there 30 May, 1876. After successfully completing the gymnasium course of his native town, he devoted himself to the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1839, and soon after made assistant at St. Castor's in Coblenz. In 1842 Bishop Arnoldi made him his private secretary, and, at the end of the same year, professor of dogmatics in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. From 1849 to 1862 he was director of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and also preacher at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; in 1850 he became a member of the chapter; from 1852 to 1856 he was representative of his fellow-citizens in the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Lower Chamber, where he joined the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> section. On 7 April, 1862, he was <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a> as <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>; after Arnoldi's death he was proposed for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> government acknowledged him only after the death of Arnoldi's successor, Pelldram, 16 July, 1867. Having chosen <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> for his ideal, he spared no exertion, on the one hand, to make his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> learned, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a>, devout, and thoroughly cultured, and on the other to cultivate a truly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and religious spirit in the people. To attain this double end, he bestowed very great care upon his <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and demanded a conscientious observation of his rules on the pastoral conferences and the annual <a href="../cathen/12795b.htm">retreat</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> he insisted on the instruction in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> and on the giving of missions, took care that religious associations were established, especially among the youths and men, and tried to found everywhere good <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> for the people. At the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> he appeared several times as a speaker; he belonged to the minority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who considered the <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">definition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">pope's infallibility</a> as inopportune for the time being; but as soon as the matter had been decided, he published the constitution at once. When, in the beginning of the seventies, the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> government wished to fetter <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> by its ecclesiastico-political legislation, Bishop Eberhard unflinchingly defended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and thus became one of the first victims of the so-called <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em>. At first he was fined an exorbitant sum, but since he could not pay it, he was retained in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> from 6 March to 31 December, 1874. New <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> began after he had been dismissed; the flourishing institutions which belonged to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were closed and the appointment of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> was made impossible; the grief at the unhappy condition of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> accelerated his death. He is the author of a dissertation "De tituli Sedis Apostolicae ad insigniendam sedem Romanam usu antiquo ac vi singulari" (Trier, 1877-1883; Freiburg, 1894-1903).
