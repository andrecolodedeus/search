<h1>Matth&aelig;us Schinner</h1>  

<p>Bishop, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and statesman, b. at Muhlbach in the Canton of Valais, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, about 1470; d. of the plague at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, l October, 1522. He was the son of the lord of Martigny; his uncle Nicholas, later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14014c.htm">Sion</a> (Sitter), gave him his early instruction. He embraced the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> career, and eventually became <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Aernen (1496), and canon and dean of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Sion. When his uncle resigned, he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14014c.htm">Sion</a> (20 September, 1499). Schinner's great diplomatic skill and his influence over the other <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> cantons allied with Valais made him the right hand of Popes <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> and <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> in their efforts to unite <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and expel the French. In 1511, as a result of an alliance brought about by Schinner, the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> made two unsuccessful campaigns against <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. As a reward for securing this alliance, he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a> and also <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1511. In 1512, as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, he was appointed commander of a <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> army, drove the French from <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and established Maximilian Sforza as duke. However, as Louis XII again captured <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> after the death of <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, Schinner one more took the field at the head of the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Confederates, and defeated the French in the battle of <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a> (1513). The Duke of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> rewarded Schinner with the margraviate of <a href="../cathen/15426b.htm">Vigevano</a>.

<p>When under <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> the French recrossed the Alps, Schinner led the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> troops, part of which had retired, at the unfortunate battle of Marignano (1515). In 1516 he raised another army with the aid of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but was unable to regain <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. He now sought to attain his end by an alliance between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the emperor, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, for which purpose he went himself in 1516 to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, but the reconciliation of the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Confederation and the emperor with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> made the alliance abortive. During his long-absence from home the French party there, under his bitter enemy George Supersax, raised a rebellion and drove him from Sion. He lived for several years at <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a> (1517-19), and thenceforth mostly at the court of the emperor. He supported the election of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> as emperor in 1519, for which he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03429a.htm">Catania</a> in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> (Nov., 1520). In 1521 he led an army of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Confederates in the imperial campaign against <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> for the possession of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. But for his passionate <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he would have been elected the successor of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>; however, <a href="../cathen/01159b.htm">Adrian VI</a> called him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as administrator of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>. He died without having seen his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> again. His large and widely scattered correspondence is the only literary work he left. The date of his birth has been disputed, as the statements concerning it differ nearly twenty years. The year is unknown, and all direct indications are lacking. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, however, that he attended the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Lupulus at Bern, which was not opened until 1493. As Schinner was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1492, the year of his birth could not be later than 1470.
