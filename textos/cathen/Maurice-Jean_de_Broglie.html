<h1>Maurice-Jean de Broglie</h1>  

<p>Born in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 5 September, 1766; d. there, 20 June, 1821. He was the son of the Field-Marshal, Victor-Francois, Duc de Broglie, created, by Emperor Francis I, Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, a title which was to be hereditary in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Called to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>, Maurice pursued his studies at St.-Sulpice. During the Reign of Terror, when <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> drove both his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and him out of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, they went to Berlin. King Frederick William received the duke with marked distinction and granted to the young prince a provostship in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of Posen. Maurice returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1803, and the steps he took to recover some <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> not yet sold, brought him to the attention of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, who invited him to his court and named him his almoner. Recognizing in the emperor the restorer and support of order and religion, de Broglie became a devoted follower of the monarch and eulogized him in a pastoral letter issued on the occasion of the victory of Austerlitz. In 1805 <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> nominated him to the <a href="../cathen/01110a.htm">See of Acqui</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and in 1807 to <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> When it became evident, however, to de Broglie that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were to be mere tools of the despot, and religion the instrument of his ambitious designs, he showed determined opposition to <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>. In 1809 the minister of worship wrote in a letter that the sovereign was highly displeased with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> because of his lack of devotion to the royal <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; in 1810 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> refused the Cross of the Legion of Honor, sent to him by the emperor, judging that he could not accept such a distinction at the time when the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a> had been seized, and he explained his refusal in a memoir, a model of moderation, sent to the minister.

<p>By order of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, a council was assembled in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 17 June, 1811, under the presidency of <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Cardinal Fesch</a>, uncle of the emperor and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. The object of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> was to <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">oblige</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to grant the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of institution to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> nominated by him to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>; this <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> had firmly refused. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> wished, furthermore, to make an arrangement that would force the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the future to issue the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> within six months, and should His Holiness fail to do so in that time, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> or the oldest <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> would then confirm the nominee, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff's</a> silence being considered as assent. The fathers of the council solemnly assembled in the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church, there being present six <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, nine <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, and eighty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; this was the first and the last general session. After six preliminary particular sessions, a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> in compliance with the will of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> was proposed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. At first only two, d'Aviau, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, and de Broglie, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, rejected it; but subsequently, only four members were for the pure and simple acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had privately declared that such encroachments on his spiritual power were contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, destructive of the authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and of the principles on which depended the lawful mission of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, provoked by such firm and general opposition, led him to prorogue the council and visit with severe punishments the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had been most prominent in their opposition. Arrested on 12 July, 1811, de Broglie was cast into the dungeon at Vincennes and kept in close confinement for more than four months, without outside communication, and without books or writing materials. He was next sent as an exile to Beaune. On the mere suspicion that he had intercourse with his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, he was deported to the island of Ste.-Marguerite on the coast of Provence. De Broglie while in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> signed, under compulsion, his resignation as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>. Although it was not accepted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and was consequently null, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> named a successor to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. As the great majority, however, of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people refused to acknowledge him, they were subjected to vexations and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. The fall of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> restored peace, and de Broglie, returning to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was received amid the rejoicings of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and flock.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was not to enjoy a long rest. The allied sovereigns of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> after the overthrow of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> had formed <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, or the Low Countries, into a kingdom and appointed William of Nassau to rule over them. The plenipotentiaries of the powers, assembled in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 1814, made the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Constitution the fundamental law of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, with a proviso that it should be modified according to circumstances. The generality of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgians</a> are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. On 18 July, 1815, William proposed the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Constitution to the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgians</a>, and the representatives summoned to vote upon it rejected it by 796 to 527. (See <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">BELGIUM</a>.) The king, disregarding the vote, imposed upon the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgians</a> a constitution that deprived the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of all their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> by his petty persecutions had lost the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> for <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>; <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, following in the footsteps of the "emperor sexton", lost them for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; William, his imitator, brought about the secession of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> from <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and its independence in 1830. De Broglie with the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a> and Tournai, and the Vicars-General of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> and <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> took up the defence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause, and issued a pastoral instruction and, later on, a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> judgment on the required <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to the Constitution.

<p>De Broglie also appealed to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, and the pontiff, on 16 May, 1816, sent an official note to the minister of the Low Countries residing in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, stating that the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Constitution contained statements contrary to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, that the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> could not in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> be reproved, and that no <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> should be imposed. New difficulties then arose, first when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> refused to offer public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the king, and again when at the erection of new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, de Broglie addressed a representation to the king in which he pointed out the introduction of dangerous books into public institutions, and strongly expressed his fears for the fate of the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. Cited before the tribunal, he took refuge in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and the court of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> by a judgment, 8 November, 1817, condemned him to deportation. The sentence was posted by the public executioner between the sentences of two public malefactors. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> health broke down under the weight of so many severe trials; succumbing to a short illness, he died in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> by all for his sterling qualities and austerity of life. In 1819, de Broglie printed a protest concerning the state of religious affairs in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, which was addressed to the Emperors of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and to the King of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>.
