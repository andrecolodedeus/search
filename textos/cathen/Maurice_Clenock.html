<h1>Maurice Clenock</h1>  

<p>(Or Clynog.)

<p>Date of birth unknown; died about 1580. He was b. in <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, where he was admitted Bachelor of Canon Law in 1548. During Mary's reign he became almoner and secretary to <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a>, <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebendary</a> of York, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of Orpington (Kent), and dean of Shoreham and <a href="../cathen/04541a.htm">Croydon</a>, and chancellor of the prerogative court of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. In 1556 he was made <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> or Corwen in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph</a>, and on the death of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bangor in 1558 was nominated to the vacant see, but was never <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, owing to the change of religion under Elizabeth. Surrendering all his preferments, he accompanied <a href="../cathen/06631b.htm">Bishop Goldwell</a> of <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where they resided in the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, of which Clenock was <em>camerarius</em> in 1567. In 1578 he was made its warden. At the same time <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> ordered the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> to be converted into a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> until <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> should return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The warden was made the first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the college by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; but <a href="../cathen/01322b.htm">Cardinal Allen</a> judged him unfit, thought he described him as "an honest and friendly man and a great advancer of the students' and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries'</a> cause" (Letter to Dr. Lewis, 12 May 1579). Despite his personal good qualities he did not prove a competent ruler. He was accused of unduly favouring his fellow-countrymen at the expense of the English students, who numbered thirty-three as against seven Welshmen. Feeling ran so high that, as Allen wrote, "Mischief and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> had like to have been committed <em>in ipso collegio</em>" (letter cited above). The students, having unsuccessfully appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, left the college, and finally the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in April, 1579, appointed Father Agazzari, S.J., <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, leaving Dr. Clenock still warden of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. He retired, however, in 1580 to <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, where he took ship for <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, but was lost at sea. In contemporary documents he is frequently referred to as "Dr. Morrice".
