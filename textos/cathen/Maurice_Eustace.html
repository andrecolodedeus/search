<h1>Maurice Eustace</h1>  

<p>Eldest son of Sir John Eustace, Castlemartin, County Kildars, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> for the Faith, Nov. 1581. Owing to the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> he was sent to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, where, after the completion of his secular studies, he desired to enter the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. His father, however, wrote the superiors of the college to send him home Maurice returned to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, much against his own inclinations, but in hope of being able, later on, to carry out his desire. After a brief stay, during which he tried to dissuade his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> from opposing his vocation, he went back to <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. His old masters at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> on learning his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> determination advised him to return to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and devote himself in the world to the service of religion. Shortly after his arrival in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> he got an appointment as captain of horse, in which position he did much to edify, and even win back to the Faith, those who served under him. He never abandoned the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of becoming a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and secretly took <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a>. His servant, who was aware of the fact, told his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, who had his son immediately arrested and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. A younger brother, desiring to inherit the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> estates, also reported Maurice to be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, and a friend of the Queen's enemies. As a consequence he was put on trial for high treason. During his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> Adam Loftus, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, offered him his daughter in marriage, and a large dowry if he would accept the reformed religion. Yielding neither to the bribery nor <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, Eustace was sentenced to public execution, and hanged.
