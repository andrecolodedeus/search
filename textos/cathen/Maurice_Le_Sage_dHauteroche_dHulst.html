<h1>Maurice Le Sage d'Hauteroche d'Hulst</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, writer, orator; born at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 10 Oct., 1841; died there, 6 Nov., 1896. After a distinguished course in the Coll&egrave;ge Stanislas, he entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Saint-Sulpice and later proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to finish his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies. There he obtained the doctorate in divinity. On his return he was for some time employed on the mission as <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> in the populous <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Ambrose. During the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1870 he became a volunteer <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> in the army. In 1873 Cardinal Guibert called him to take part in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but he was engaged principally in founding and organizing the free Catholic University, which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> opened at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> after the passage of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 12 July, 1875, allowing liberty of higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. He became its <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> in 1880 and for fifteen years devoted himself to developing it in every branch of learning, and, while concerned for its <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, was no less anxious that it should meet the needs of scientific progress. In 1891 he succeeded <a href="../cathen/10508c.htm">P&egrave;re Monsabr&eacute;</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of Notre-Dame de Paris and preached the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> conferences there for six successive years, on the bases of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">Christian morality</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>. In 1892 he was elected deputy for Finist&egrave;re on the death of <a href="../cathen/06277a.htm">Mgr Freppel</a>. Although a royalist by <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> tradition, Mgr d'Hulst did not hesitate to give his loyal support to the republic when <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> requested the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to do so. In addition to all these labours, he was busily engaged as a <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a>. He was able to undertake so much on account of his wonderful energy and capacity for work. He died while still active, after a short illness, and his death was a cause of sorrow to the whole French Church.

<p>He was very <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and broad-minded, and was naturally inclined to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies. His word and pen were ever at the service of religion, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and charity; but his chief efforts were directed towards encouraging higher studies, especially the study of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a>, among the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In connexion with this we must recall the great work he did in organizing and carrying out the International Scientific Congresses of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. As an orator, his words were somewhat cold and didactic, but very clear, precise, and pregnant with sense. Besides two biographies, the "Vie de la M&egrave;re Marie-Th&eacute;r&egrave;se" (Paris, 1872) and the "Vie de Just de Breteni&egrave;res" (Paris, 1892), he wrote "L'&eacute;ducation sup&eacute;rieure" (Paris, 1886); "Le Droit chr&eacute;tien et le Droit moderne", a commentary on the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Immortale" of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (Paris, 1886), a volume of "M&eacute;langes philosophiques" (2nd ed., 1903); and also published two volumes "M&eacute;langes oratoires" (Paris, 1891 and 1892) and the six volumes of his "Conf&eacute;renees de Notre-Dame", enriched with notes and appendixes (Paris, 1891-96). It is impossible to mention the many articles he contributed to the current reviews, but among the more important ones we may cite the "Examen de conscience de Renan"; "Une Ame royale et chr&eacute;tienne" (a touching necrology of the Comte de Paris), and "La Question biblique". Most of his occasional discourses were collected and published by the Abb&eacute; Odelin in the four volumes entitled "Nouveaux M&eacute;langes oratoires" (Paris, 1900-07). Mgr Baudrillart, his successor at the head of the Catholic University, after the rectorship of Mgr P&eacute;chenard, published a collection of "Lettresde Direction" of Mgr d'Hulst.
