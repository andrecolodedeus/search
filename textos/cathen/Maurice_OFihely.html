<h1>Maurice O'Fihely</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, born about 1460; died at <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>, 1513. He was, according to Dr. Lynch, a native of <a href="../cathen/04064b.htm">Clonfert</a> in <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>, but, according to Ware and Anthony &agrave; Wood, a native of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> in <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>. He is sometimes called Maurice a Portu, Baltimore being situated on the sea coast. Part of his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was received at the <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">University of Oxford</a>, where he joined the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. Later he studied at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, where he obtained the degree of Doctor of Divinity. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he was appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11387a.htm">University of Padua</a>. He was a student of the works of <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Duns Scotus</a>, and wrote a commentary on them (published at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> about 1514). O'Fihely acted for some time as corrector of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> to two well-known publishers at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, Scott and Locatelli--in the early days a task usually entrusted to very learned men. O'Fihely was acknowledged one of the most learned men of his time, so learned that his contemporaries called him <em>Flos Mundi</em> (Flower of the World). In addition, his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and administrative capacity were recognized at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in 1506 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>. He did not return to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> till 1513, meantime attending as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a> the first two sessions of the Lateran Council (1512). On leaving for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to take formal possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, he procured from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> for all those who would be present at his first Mass in <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>. He was destined not to reach Tuam, for he fell ill in <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>, and died there in the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>.
