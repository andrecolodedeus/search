<h1>Maurus Corker</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, born in 1636 in Yorkshire; died 22 December, 1715, at Paddington near London. His <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">baptismal name</a>, James, he exchanged for Maurus when he entered the order. On 23 April, 1656, he took <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> at the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Lamspringe near <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as missionary in 1665. Being accused by Titus Oates of implication in <a href="../cathen/11173c.htm">"the Popish Plot"</a> he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in Newgate, but was acquitted of treason by a <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> jury, 18 July, 1679. Hereupon he was arraigned for being a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and sentenced to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>, 17 January, 1680. Through influential friends he was granted a reprieve and detained in Newgate. While thus confined he is said to have reconciled more than a thousand <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> to the Faith. One of his fellow-prisoners at Newgate was the saintly <a href="../cathen/12169b.htm">Oliver Plunket</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, with whom he formed an intimate friendship, and whom he prepared for his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, which took place, 15 June, 1681. Some very interesting correspondence which was carried on in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> between these two confessors of the Faith was published in the "Irish Ecclesiastical Record" (Sept., 1883). On the accession of James II in 1685, Father Corker was released and kept at the court as resident ambassador of Prince-Bishop Ferdinand of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, the Elector of Cologne. In 1687 he erected the little <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. John at Clerkenwell, where religious services were held for the public, but which was destroyed by a mob, 11 November, 1688, during the revolt against King James. Father Corker himself was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to seek refuge on the continent. In 1691 he was made <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cismar near L&uuml;beck and, two years later, of Lamspringe, where he had made his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>. In 1696 he resigned as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to continue his missionary labours. He is the author of various pamphlets proving the innocence of those condemned for implication in the fictitious "Popish Plot."
