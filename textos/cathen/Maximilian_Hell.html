<h1>Maximilian Hell</h1>  

<p>(H&ouml;ll).

<p>Astronomer, b. at Schemnitz in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, 15 May, 1720; d. at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 14 April, 1792. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at Trentschin, 18 October, 1738, and after his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> was sent to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where he made his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> studies. From his early years he had shown a strong inclination for <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> pursuits, and in 1744 he devoted himself to the study of mathematics and <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, acting at the same time as assistant to Father Joseph Franz, the director of the observatory at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. After teaching with much success for a year at Leutschau, he returned to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> to study <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, and in 1751 was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He received a professorship of mathematics at Klausenberg in 1752, and remained there until 1755, when he was appointed director of the imperial observatory at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>.

<p>Father Hell's most important work was perhaps the annual publication of the "Ephemerides astronomic&aelig; ad meridianem Vindobonensem", which he began in 1757 and continued for many years. These contain a large number of valuable observations and data. He was invited by the King of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> to undertake at Vard&ouml;huus, <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, the observations of the transit of Venus of 1769. The transit observations were successful, and after spending some months in <a href="../cathen/04352a.htm">Copenhagen</a> preparing his results for the press, he returned to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1770. Owing to delays in publication Hell was afterwards suspected of manipulating his data to make them fit with others taken elsewhere. The suspicion was strengthened by Littrow when director of the Vienna Observatory, after a study of the original <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> (cf. Hell's "Reise nach Ward&ouml; u. seine Beobachtung des Venus-Durchgangs in Jahre 1769", Vienna, 1835). It was not until 1890 that Father Hell's <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> was cleared of the stain of <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> by Professor Simon Newcomb, who made a critical study of the journal in question, and showed conclusively that Littrow's inferences were entirely at fault. The latter, it appears, had originally been led into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by a defect in his sense of colour. Father Hell was of a gentle disposition and simple in his tastes. His devotion to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to his order often cost him much <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Besides his "Ephemerides", he was also the author of "Elementa algebr&aelig; Joannis Crivelli magis illustrata" (Vienna, 1745); "Adjumentum memori&aelig; manuale chronologico-genealogico-historicum" (Vienna, 1750); "De la c&eacute;l&eacute;bration de la P&acirc;que" (ibid, 1761); "Elementa arithmetic&aelig; numeric&aelig; et litteralis' (ibid, 1763); "De satellite Veneris" (ibid, 1765); "De Transitu Veneris" (Copenhagen, 1770), etc.
