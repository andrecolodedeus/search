<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Maximilian I</h1>  

<p>Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, 1598-1622, Elector of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and Lord High Steward of the Holy Roman Empire, 1623-1651; b. at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 17 April, 1573; d. at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>, 27 September, 1651. The lasting services he rendered his country and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> justly entitle him to the surname of "Great". He was the son of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, William V, the Pious, of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and Renate of Lorraine. Mentally well endowed, Maximilian received a strict <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> training from private tutors and later (1587-91) studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, history, and mathematics at the <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a>. He further increased his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by visits to foreign courts, as Prague and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and to places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> including <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Loretto, and <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>. Thus equipped Maximilian assumed (15 Oct., 1597) the government of the small, thinly populated country at his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> wish during the latter's lifetime. Owing to the over-lenient rule of the two preceding rulers the land was burdened with a heavy <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>. By curtailing expenditure and enlarging the revenues, chiefly by working the salt-mines himself and by increasing the taxes without regard to the complaints of the powerless estates, the finances were not only brought into a better condition, but it was also possible to collect a reserve fund which, in spite of the unusually difficult conditions of the age, was never quite exhausted. At the same time internal order was maintained by a series of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> issued in 1616. Maximilian gave great attention to military matters. No other German prince of that time possessed an army so well organized and equipped. Its commander was the veteran soldier from the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> <a href="../cathen/14724c.htm">Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly</a>, who, austere himself, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to maintain discipline among his troops. The fortifications at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a> on the Danube were greatly strengthened, and <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> and other towns were surrounded by walls and moats. Well-filled arsenals were established in different places as preparation for time of need. Opportunity for the use of this armament soon offered itself.

<p>The small free city of Donauw&ouml;rth fell under the imperial ban for violating the religious peace. In executing the imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> Maximilian not only succeeded in bringing this city into subjection to <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> but also in re-establishing the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as the one and only religion in it. This led to the forming (1608) of the Protestant Union, an offensive and defensive confederation of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes, in opposition to which arose in 1609 the Catholic League organized by Maximilian. Oddly enough, both coalitions were headed by princes of the Wittelsbach line: Maximilian I as head of the League, Frederick IV of the Palatinate, of the Union. The <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a>, during which <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> suffered terribly, broke out in 1619. Under <a href="../cathen/14724c.htm">Tilly's</a> leadership the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> revolt was crushed at the battle of the White Mountain (Weissen Berg) near <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, 8 November, 1620, and the newly elected King of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, Frederick V, forced to flee. His allies, the Margrave of Baden and the Duke of Brunswick, were defeated by the forces of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and the League at Wimpfen and Hochst (1622), as was also at a later date (1626) King Christian of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. Conditions, however, changed when Maximilian, through jealousy of the House of Hapsburgh, was led in 1630 to seek the dismissal of the head of the imperial army, Wallenstein. The youthful <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> king, Gustavus Adolphus, defeated <a href="../cathen/14724c.htm">Tilly</a>, the veteran leader of the army of the League at Breitenfeld (1631), and in a battle with Gustavus Adolphus near the Lech, 16 April, 1632, <a href="../cathen/14724c.htm">Tilly</a> was again vanquished, receiving a wound from which he died two weeks later at <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">Ingolstadt</a>. Although the siege of this city by the Swedes was unsuccessful, Gustavus plundered the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> towns and villages, laid waste the country and pillaged <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>.

<p>Maximilian, who since 1623 had been both Elector and ruler of the Upper Palatinate, implored Wallenstein, now once more the head of the imperial forces, for help in vain until he agreed to place himself and his army under Wallenstein's command. The united forces under Wallenstein took up an entrenched position near <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> where Wallenstein repulsed the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> attacks; by advancing towards Saxony he even forced them to evacuate Maximilian's territories. The relief to <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, however, was not of long duration. After the death of Gustavus Adolphus at the battle of L&uuml;tzen (1632) Bernhard of Weimar, unmolested by Wallenstein, ravaged <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> until he received a crushing defeat the battle of Nordlingen (6 Sept., 1634). Even in the last ten years of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> the country was not spared from hostile attacks. Consequently Maximilian sought by means of a truce with the enemy (1647) to gain for <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> an opportunity to recover. The desired result, however, not being attained, he united his forces to those of the imperial army, but the allied troops were not sufficient to overthrow the confederated French and Swedes, and once more suffered all the terrors of a pitiless invasion. The fighting ended with the capture of the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> generals, 6 Oct., 1648, and the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> was signed at Munster, 24 Oct. of the same year. The material benefits derived by Maximilian from his attitude in politics were meagre: the Electoral dignity, the office of Lord High Steward, and the Upper Palatinate. The abstract gains, on the other hand, appear far greater. Not only since then has <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> had the second place among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> principalities of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, ranking next to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, but for centuries a strong bulwark was opposed to the advance of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, and the latter was, at times, even driven back. A few years after the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> and eighteen months after the administration of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> had been transferred to his still minor son Ferdinand Maria, Maximilian's eventful and troublesome life closed. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Michael at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. A fine equestrian <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, designed by Thorwaldsen and cast by Stiglmayer, was erected at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> by King Louis I in 1839.

<p>Although there was almost incessant <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> during his reign, and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> in the middle of the seventeenth century was like a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, nevertheless Maximilian did much for the arts, e.g. by building the palace, the <em>Mariens&auml;ule</em> (Mary Column), etc. Learning also, especially at the <a href="../cathen/08007d.htm">University of Ingolstadt</a>, had in this era distinguished representatives. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Balde was a brilliant writer both of Latin and German verse and Father Scheiner, another member of the same order, was the first to discover the spots on the sun; historians also, such as Heinrich Canisius, <a href="../cathen/12631a.htm">Matthias Rader</a>, etc., produced important works of lasting merit.

<p>Maximilian, however, gave for more attention to the advancement of religion among the people than to art and learning. He founded five <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a>: Amberg, Burghausen, Landshut, Mindelheim, and Straubing. Besides establishing a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for the Minims and one for the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, he founded nine <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> for <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and fourteen for <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> who venerate him as one of their greatest benefactors. He also founded at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> a home for aged and infirm Court officials, and gave 30,000 guldens for the Chinese missions, as well as large sums to the Scotch-English college of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>. His private charities among the poor and needy of all descriptions were unlimited.

<p>Maximilian was endowed with an uncommon ability for work. He was also sincerely religious and rigidly moral in conduct; he even went beyond the permissible in his efforts to uphold and spread the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Maintaining like all princes of his time the axiom "Cujus regio ejus religio", he not only put down every movement in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in his country but also exterminated <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> and Lutheranism root and branch in the territories he had acquired. Where admonition and instruction were not sufficient the soldier stepped in, and the poor people, who had already been <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to change their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> several times with change of ruler, had now no choice but return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or exile. Maximilian, in addition, never lost sight of secular advantage, as is shown by his numerous acquisitions of territory. Especially valuable was the purchase of two-thirds of the countship of Helfenstein, now a part of Wurtemberg, which as a <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> dependence was preserved to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and has remained <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> up to the present time, notwithstanding its <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> surroundings. Maximilian was twice married. The first marriage was childless. By his second wife Maria, daughter of the Emperor Ferdinand II, whom he married 15 July, 1635, he had two sons; the elder of these, Ferdinand Maria, as already mentioned, succeeded him.
