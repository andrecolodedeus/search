<h1>Meath</h1>  

<p>(MIDENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, suffragan of Armagh. In extent it is the largest diocese in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and includes the greater part of the counties Meath, Westmeath, King's, and a small portion of the counties Longford, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and Cavan. The present Diocese of Meath anciently comprised eight <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>, the chief of which was Clonard, founded in the middle of the sixth century by St. Finian, "Tutor of the Saints of Erin". At the <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national Synod</a> of Kells, in 1172, over which Cardinal Paparo presided as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a>, it was decided that these sees be joined together. The united see was assigned as first suffragan to <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, and ranks immediately after the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan sees</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. In his "Hibernia Dominicana" De Burgo says that Meath is the foremost suffragan of Armagh, and has precedence even though its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be the youngest of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> in order of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Meath being the country of the Pale, many Englishmen were appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Meath, among them the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> Staples who <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> in the reign of Edward VI, and was deposed in 1554. Dr. Walsh, a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, succeeded, and more than repaired the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> caused by his recreant predecessor. This noble confessor of the Faith <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravely</a> withstood all the threats and blandishments of Queen Elizabeth and her agents. He spent thirteen years in a dungeon in Dublin Castle, and finally died an exile at <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. His name is reckoned in more than one <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Martyrology. Like <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is paid to him by his own order, and his <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> biographer contends that the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> crown is his as truly as if he had died in torments. The succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the See of Meath has been continued without interruption to the present day, except during a few brief interregnums in the penal days. It is a noteworthy fact that, omitting Dr. Logan's short reign of a few years, but three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> ruled the Diocese of Meath from 1779 to 1899, Drs. Plunket, Cantwell, and Nulty. Dr. Plunket, who had been professor and superior in the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a> of the Lombards, Paris, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1779. The vessel in which he returned to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was attacked and plundered by the famous Paul Jones, the American privateer, who, however, to his credit be it said, afterwards restored the episcopal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. For eight and forty years, with a truly Apostolic spirit, this great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> traversed the whole diocese yearly, visiting every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, preaching, catechizing, giving seasonable counsel to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and suitable instruction to the people, so that in his declining years he was fittingly called, by the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Armagh, "the ornament and father of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church". The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> compiled by Dr. Plunket cannot easily be improved, and is still used in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He died in January, 1827, in his eighty-ninth year. His successor, Dr. Logan, lived only a few years, and was succeeded by Dr. Cantwell, the steadfast friend of Daniel O'Connell. With great energy Dr. Cantwell gathered the scattered stones of the sanctuary, and re-erected the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> levelled in the penal days. Dr. Nulty became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1864, and during his episcopate of thirty-four years spent himself in the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his people. A profound <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and ardent student, he put before his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> a high <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> standard; at the same time he did much to overthrow landlordism and to root the people firmly in their native soil. The population of the Diocese of Meath at the last census (1901) was 143,164, of whom 132,892 were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Since 1871 the population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has decreased 27 per cent.; during the same period the non-Catholic population decreased 35 per cent. There are 144 churches and 66 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 155 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and 12 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regulars</a>, 3 <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">monastic houses</a> of men with 17 members, and 13 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> with 134 members. St. Finian's College, an imposing structure erected in Mullingar and opened in 1908, replaces the old building in Navan, which had held, for more than one hundred years, an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> place among the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The new college, which cost over &#163;340,000, has accommodation for 150 students and is intended both as a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> to prepare <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and to impart a sound <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> liberal <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to those intended for worldly pursuits. There is a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and college at Tullamore, and a house of <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Fathers at Moate. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> province have a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and preparatory <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Multyfarnham, near the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> town of Mullingar. The Abbey of Multyfarnham has been in <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> hands since pre-Reformation times, and has witnessed the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fortunes of the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Brothers have a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Clara, and the <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Christian Brothers</a> have a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Mullingar (500 pupils) and at Clara (200 pupils). At Rochfortbridge, St. Joseph's Institute for the Deaf and Dumb is conducted by the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>. The Loreto Nuns have <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> houses in Navan and Mullingar, which have won favourable recognition. The Presentation Sisters have foundations in Mullingar and Rahan, where they have charge of the primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> have <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> at Navan and Kells, take care of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> in Tullamore, Trim, Mullingar, Drogheda, and Navan, and at the same time conduct national <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the principal towns of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>.

<p>The Diocese of Meath, often called the "royal diocese", is rich in historic associations, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. In Meath was Tara "of the kings", the palace of the Ard-righ, whither came the chieftains and princes, the bards and brehons of Erin. The principal cemetery of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> kings of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was at Brugh-na-B&oacute;inne. Competent authorities declare that the surrounding tumuli are among the oldest in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Close at hand is Rosnaree, where Cormac Mac Art, the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> King of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, who refused to be buried in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Brugh, awaits the last summons. Uisneach in Westmeath, Tlachtgha, or the Hill of Ward, and Teltown were celebrated for their royal palaces, their solemn conventions, their <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> games, and their druidic ceremonies, and in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> times were sanctified by the labours of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> and St. Brigid. Slane reminds us of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick's</a> first <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, when he lit the paschal fire, symbolizing the lamp of Faith which has never since been extinguished. Trim, founded by <a href="../cathen/09335a.htm">St. Loman</a>, one of the first disciples of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, still retains in its many ruins striking evidences of its departed glories. Kells, with its round tower, its splendid sculptured crosses, and the house of Columcille, reminds us of that "Dove of the Irish Church", whose memory is also cherished in his beloved Durrow. Finally, Meath is the birthplace of the <a href="../cathen/12169b.htm">Venerable Oliver Plunket</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Armagh, the last victim publicly sacrificed in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for the Faith.

<p>[<em>Note:</em> Oliver Plunket was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1975.]
