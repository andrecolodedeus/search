<h1>Mechitar</h1>  

<p>(MECHITHAR, MEKHITAR, MCHITAR or MOCHTOR, a word which means "Comforter")

<p>Mechitar is the name taken by Peter Manuk, founder of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order of <a href="../cathen/10102b.htm">Mechitarists</a>, when he became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. A native of <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a> (Sivas) in Lesser <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, born 7 February, 1676, of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> reputed noble, he was left until the age of fifteen in the care of two <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. Then he entered the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of the Holy Cross near <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a>, and the same year (1691), was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> by Bishop Ananias. Shortly afterwards, impelled by his thirst for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he left the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>&mdash;not putting off the habit or infringing his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> (the Eastern <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> could, for a proper reason, lawfully leave the enclosure) and set forth, in the company of a doctor of that city, for Etchmiadzin, the capital of Greater <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, persuaded that it was the centre of civilization and the home of all the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. During the journey he met with a <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> missionary and a fellow <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, whose accounts of the wonders of the West changed the course of his life. Stirred with an admiration of Western culture and the desire to introduce it among his countrymen, he wandered from place to place, earning a scanty living by teaching. After eighteen months he returned to Sebaste where he remained for some time, still ambitious to study Western civilization. Even then he had conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of founding a religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>&mdash;suggested, doubtless, by the well-intentioned but long since suppressed association of the "United Brothers"&mdash;which would labour to introduce Western <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and Western influence into <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. This would imply a formal reunion of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and there would be an end of that wavering between Constantinople and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, so injurious to the spiritual and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> welfare of his country. At Sebaste, he devoted himself to the reading of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> sacred writers and the Syrian and <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> in translations, and, after a vain attempt to reach <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> from <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (1696) in his own city, and (1699) received the title and staff of doctor (Vartabed) . Then he began to preach, and went to Constantinople with the intention of founding an <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> College. He continued his preaching there, generally in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. George, gathered some disciples around him, and distinguished himself by his advocacy of union with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Serious trouble ensued with a violent <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> excited by the action of Count Ferrol, minister of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> at Stamboul, who carried off to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> the anti-Catholic <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. Naturally, the fervour of Mechitar and his disciples in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause, and the success of their preaching singled them out for special attention. The two <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, urged by a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a>, Avedik, led the attack. Mechitar wisely dismissed his disciples and himself took refuge in a <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> under French protection. Pursued by his enemies, he escaped to the Morea, thence to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> territory, finding shelter in a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> house. He attributed his safety to our Blessed Lady, under whose protection, on 8 Sept., the Feast of her Nativity, he had solemnly placed himself and his <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> kindly gave him some <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> at Modon (1701), where he built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, and laid the foundations of the <a href="../cathen/10102b.htm">Mechitarist</a> Order. <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> gave it formal approval in 1712, and appointed Mechitar Abbot. Three years later <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> broke out between <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and the Porte, and the new <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was in jeopardy. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, leaving seventy of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> behind, crossed over to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> with sixteen companions with the intention of beginning a second foundation. It was well that he did so for the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> were defeated and the Morea was regained by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. Modon was taken, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> destroyed and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> dispersed. The house rented at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> too small and Mechitar exerted all his influence to obtain the gift of San Lazzaro, an island about two miles south-east of the city, not far from the Lido. His request granted, he restored the old ruined church, and a second time built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. This establishment has remained undisturbed in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/10102b.htm">Mechitarists</a> to the present day. At S. Lazzaro he devised many schemes for the regeneration of his country. An accusation brought against him at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>&mdash;not a personal charge but one connected with the labours undertaken by the order&mdash;resulted in a better understanding with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and the personal friendship of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He lived at S. Lazzaro for thirty years, busy with his printing-press and his literary labours, and died at the age of seventy-four, on 16 April, 1749. Since his death he is always spoken of by his children as the Abbas Pater, Abbai hairm (see <a href="../cathen/10102b.htm">MECHITARISTS</a>).

<p>The most important of his literary works are the following: "Commentary on the Gospel of St. Matthew" (1737); "Commentary on Ecclesiasticus" (Venice); "Armenian Grammar"; "Armenian Grammar of the Vulgar Tongue"; "Armenian Dictionary" (1744, and in two volumes, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1749-69); "Armenian Catechism", both in the literary and vulgar tongues; "A Poem on the Blessed Virgin"; "Armenian Bible" (1734).
