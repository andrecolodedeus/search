<h1>Mechitarists</h1>  

<p>Armenian <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, founded by Mechitar in 1712. In its inception the order was looked upon merely as an attempted reform of Eastern monachism. P. Filippo Bonanni, S.J., writes at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 1712 when the order received its approval, of the arrival of P. Elias Martyr and P. Joannes Simon, two <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> sent by Mechitar to <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Pope Clement XI</a> to offer His Holiness the most <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> subjection of himself and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> (<em>Ut ei se cum suis religiosis humillime subjiceret</em>). There is no mention, at the moment, of the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Benedictine rule</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, such as St. Anthony instituted in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (<em>quos St. Antonius in Aegypto instituerat</em>), have begun a foundation in Modon with Mechitar (Mocht&agrave;r) as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>.

<p>After two years' <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">noviceship</a>, they take the usual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, with a fourth in addition &mdash; "to give obedience to the preceptor or master deputed by their superior to teach them the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>". Many of them <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> themselves also to missionary work in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, and Turkey, where they live on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> and wear as a badge, beneath the tunic, a cross of red cloth, on which are certain letters signifying their desire to shed their blood for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. They promise on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to work together in harmony so that they may the better win the schismatics back to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. They elect an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> for life, who has the power to dismiss summarily any of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who should prove disorderly. They wear the <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a>, Oriental fashion, and have a black habit &mdash; tunic, cloak and hood. In the engraving attached to the description, the Mechitarist would be undistinguishable from a regular <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> of St. Augustine, except for his <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">beard</a>. When however, <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Pope Clement XI</a> gave them his approval, it was as <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> under the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">rule of St. Benedict</a>, and he appointed Mechitar the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. This was a great innovation; nothing less than the introduction of <a href="../cathen/10472a.htm">Western monasticism</a> into the East. There, up to this time a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> undertook no <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> but to fill his place in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. He admitted no vocation but to save his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. He had, in theory, at least, broken off all relations with the outside world. He had no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of making himself useful to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, or of any <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> whatsoever save his choir <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, his fastings, and the monastic observance. He belonged to no <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order but was simply a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. Now, as a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, he would be expected to devote himself to some useful work and take some thought of his neighbour. It is clear, from P. Bonanni's description, that Mechitar and his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> wished this change and had already adopted the Western <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk's</a> vocation. The adoption of the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Benedictine rule</a>, therefore, was merely a recognition of their desire to devote themselves to apostolic work among their <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> brethren, to instruct their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, excite their devotion and bring them back into the communion of the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church. And it was also a security that they would not afterwards lapse into the apathy and inactivity associated in the Eastern mind with the life of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. It is not quite accurate to speak of them as a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> "Congregation", though it is their customary description. They are a new "Order" of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> living under the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">rule of St. Benedict</a>, as distinct from the parent order as the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a>, <a href="../cathen/14372c.htm">Silvestrines</a>, or <a href="../cathen/11244c.htm">Olivetans</a>. Hence we do not find them classed among the numerous congregations of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> order.

<p>Missionaries, writers, and educationists, devoted to the service of their <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> brethren wherever they might be found, such were and are these <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>. Their subjects usually enter the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at an early age, eight or nine years old, receive in it their elementary schooling, spend about nine years in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> study, at the canonical age of twenty-five, if sufficiently prepared, are <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> by their bishop-abbot, and are then employed by him in the various enterprises of the order. First, there is the work of the mission &mdash; not the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> ministry to the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> communities settled in most of the commercial centres of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. With this is joined, where needed and possible, the apostolate of union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Next there is the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> youth and, associated with this, the preparation and publication of good and useful <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> literature.

<p>The parent <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> is that of St. Lazzaro at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>; next in importance is that at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, founded in 1810; there is a large <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and college for lay-students at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, the legacy of a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> who died at <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>; in the year 1846 another rich benefactor, Samuel Morin, founded a similar establishment at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Other houses are in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and Turkey &mdash; fourteen in all, according to the latest statistics, with one hundred and fifty-two <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, the majority of whom are <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Not a great development for an order two hundred years old; but its extension is necessarily restricted because of its exclusive devotion to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and things <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>. Amongst their countrymen the influence of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> has been not only directive in the way of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> service to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but creative of a wholesome national <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> and self-respect. Apostles of culture and progress, they may be said, with strict <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, to have preserved from degradation and neglect the language and literature of their country, and in so doing, have been the saviours of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> race. Individually, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> are distinguished by their linguistic accomplishments, and the <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> establishment has attracted attention by the institution of a Literary Academy, which confers honorary membership without regard to race or religion.

<p>In every one of their many undertakings their founder, Mechitar, personally showed them the way. To him they owe the initiative in the study of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> writings of the fourth and fifth centuries, which has resulted in the development and adoption of a literary language, nearly as distinct from the vulgar tongue as Latin is from Italian. Thus the modern <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> remains in touch with a distinguished and inspiring past, and has at his service a rich and important literature which otherwise would have been left, unknown or unheeded, to decay. Mechitar, with his <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> "Imitation" and "Bible", began that series of translations of great books, continued unceasingly during two centuries, and ranging from the early <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> and the works of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas of Aquin</a> (one of their first labours) to Homer and Virgil and the best known poets and historians of later days.

<p>At one period, in connexion with their <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> house, there existed an association for the propagation of good books, which is said to have distributed nearly a million volumes, and printed and published six new works each year. To him also they owe the guidance of their first steps in <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> &mdash; the branch of learning in which they have won most distinction &mdash; and the kindred studies of the Liturgy and the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">religious history</a> of their country. At S. Lazzaro he founded the printing press from which the most notable of their productions have been issued, and commenced there the collection of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> for which their <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> has become famous. To any but members of the order the history of the Mechitarists has been uneventful, because of the quiet, untiring plodding along ancient, traditional paths, and the admirable fidelity to the spirit and ideals of their founder (see <a href="../cathen/10102a.htm">MECHITAR</a>).

<p>It has been principally by means of the Mechitarists' innumerable periodicals, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> manuals, Bibles, maps, engravings, dictionaries, histories, geographies and other contributions to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and popular literature, that they have done good service to the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church and nation. Following are the most valuable of their contributions to the common cause of learning. First, there is the recovery, in ancient <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> translations, of some lost works of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>. Among them may be noted "Letters (thirteen) of <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">St. Ignatius of Antioch</a>" and a fuller and more authentic "History of the Martyrdom of St. Ignatius"; some works of St. Ephrem the Syrian, notably a sort of "Harmony of the Gospels" and a "Commentary on the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>"; an exceptionally valuable edition of "Eusebius's History". The publication of these works is due to the famous Mechitarist Dom J. B. Aucher, who was assisted in the last of them by <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Cardinal Mai</a>. To Aucher also we are indebted for a German translation of the "Armenian Missal" (T&uuml;bingen, 1845) and "Dom Johannis philosophi Ozniensis Armeniorum Catholici (<font size=-2>A.D.</font>, 718) Opera" (Venice, 1534). Two original historical works may also be noted: "The History of Armenia", by P. Michel Tschamtschenanz (1784-6) and the "Quadro della storia letteraria di <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>" by Mgr. Pl. Sukias Somal (Venice, 1829).
