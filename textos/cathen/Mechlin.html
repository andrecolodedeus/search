<h1>Mechlin</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> MECHLINIA; <a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French</a> MALINES; MECHLINIENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> comprising the two <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> provinces of <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> and Brabant. This diocese derives its present configuration from the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">French Concordat of 1801</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of Mechlin is coextensive with the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Kingdom (suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>: Tournai, <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>, Gand, <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>); it extended to the Rhine under <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a>. The city of Mechlin, prior to 1559, belonged to the deanery of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> and to the archdeaconry of the same name in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>. Its importance ecclesiastically was due to the ancient Chapter of Canons of the collegiate <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Rombaut. <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, by his bull "Super universi orbis ecclesias" (12 May, 1559) created a new <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> composed of three <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> (Mechlin, <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, Utrecht) and fifteen <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Mechlin was raised to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> by the Constitutions of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> in 1560 and 1561. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> preached in the present diocese during the seventh and eighth centuries. It is known that <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> was visited by <a href="../cathen/05386a.htm">St. Eligius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> (d. 660), and by St. Amand, the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maestricht (d. 679). The latter's successors in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of Tongres-Maestricht-Li&egrave;ge, <a href="../cathen/08757a.htm">St. Lambert</a> (d. about 700) and <a href="../cathen/07507a.htm">St. Hubert</a> (d. 727) are said to have visited Mechlin and Brabant. This evangelical work was followed up by the Anglo-Saxon missionaries <a href="../cathen/15645a.htm">St. Willibrord</a> (d. 738) and St. Rumold or Rombaut (d. about 775). St. Rombaut was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at Mechlin, and became the city's <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a>, and subsequently the patron of the whole diocese. Among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are several members of Pepin of Landen's <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, his <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> St. Itta, foundress of the Abbey of Nivelles, his daughters, St. Gertrude (d. 659) and St. Begga (d. 698); the two sisters St. Gudule (d. 712) and St. Rainelde; in the ninth century St. Libert of Mechlin and St. Guidon of Anderlecht; St. Wivine, foundress of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> abbey of Grand Bigard (d. 1170); <a href="../cathen/01261b.htm">St. Albert</a> of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, Prince <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (d. 1192); St. Marie d'Orignies (d. 1232); St. Lutgard (d. 1246), and Blessed Alice (d. 1250), both <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, the former in Aywi&egrave;res, the latter at la Cambre; St. Boniface of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a> (d. 1265); <a href="../cathen/13280c.htm">Blessed Jean de Ruysbroeck</a>, an Augustinian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Groenendael, because of his mystical writings known as the "divine and admirable doctor" (d. 1381); several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> at Gorcum (1572); the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/08450a.htm">St. John Berchmans</a> of Diest, patron of student youth (d. 1621), and <a href="../cathen/09192a.htm">Venerable Leonard Leys (Lessius)</a> of Brecht, renowned for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works (d. 1623).

<p>It was at the beginning of the twelfth century that Tanchelm, a native of Zealand, became known, chiefly in <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, for his violent attacks on the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, and the Sacraments, especially the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. He shared the pernicious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01135b.htm">Adamites</a>, and gave an example of the worst kind of debauchery. Toward the middle of the century, Bishop Nicolas of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Jonas, one of the promoters of Catharism in Brabant. A little later numerous <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beghards and Beguines</a> fell into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> known as the Brothers of the Free Spirit. To this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> also belonged the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, Sister Hadewijc (Hedwig) or Bloemardine, who gained numerous partisans in <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>. Her writings were refuted by <a href="../cathen/13280c.htm">Jean de Ruysbroeck</a>. Bloemardine died about 1336, but her followers lived on, and as late as about 1410 Pierre d'Ailly, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, was compelled to take measures against them. The Black Plague of 1349 gave rise to the processions of <a href="../cathen/06089c.htm">Flagellants</a>. These hailed from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and traversed the country practicing the <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> from which their name has arisen. The <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to intervene on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> detested by the <a href="../cathen/06089c.htm">Flagellants</a>. On the other hand, religious sentiment manifested itself in numerous monastic institutions. Afflighem, the principal <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, dates from 1086. The people of <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, whom Tanchelm had fanaticized, were brought back by St. Norbert to a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mode of life. Soon arose in Brabant many <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>: St. Michel at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> (1124), Tongerloo (1128), le Parc near <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> (1129), Heylissem (1130), Grimberghen (1131), Averbode (1132), Dieligem and Postel (1140). Among other <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> for men may be mentioned: the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of Vlierbeek (1125); the noble abbey of St. Gertrude at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian canons</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of Villers (1147) and of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> (1237). Some of the numerous colleges of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Austin Canons</a> are: St. Jacques sur Caudenberg at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, Hanswijck at Mechlin, Corssendonck, Groenendael, Rougecloitre and Septfontaines, all three in the forest of Soignes. In most places of consequence Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> were established. The <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a> were represented at the Teutonic Commandery of Pitzemburg in Mechlin and in Becquevoort. The leading <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were: Grand Bigard and Cortenberg (<a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>); la Cambre, Roosendael, Nazareth (Cistercians). The semi-monastic institution of the <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguinages</a>, small settlements in the heart of cities or just outside city walls, is a peculiar feature of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. They were once numerous (the number of <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguines</a> who went forth from Mechlin to greet Charles the Bold, on the occasion of his joyful entry in 1467, was 900), and still endure, though much reduced in numbers, at Mechlin, <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, Diest, Lierre, Turnhout, Hoogstraeten and Herenthals. The increase of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> and its improved material conditions caused the chapters of Canons to grow in number, and eventually the collegiate churches of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> reached a total of twenty. Public instruction was conducted by <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> and chapter <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Finally <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, by his bull of 9 December, 1425, erected a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>.

<p>At the close of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, it is well known, both <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> suffered a notable decay. More or less rightly, Jean Pupper de Goch (d. 1475), superior of the Thabor Convent at Mechlin, has been styled the precursor of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, who soon found numerous partisans in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, especially at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> where his Augustinian brethren declared in his favour. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, though vigorously opposed by <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, was again menacing at the end of his reign, when <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> gave way to <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>. The creation in 1559 of new sees, though an indispensable measure, brought about a coalition of all discontented parties. Philip II, by removing the first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Mechlin, <a href="../cathen/06727a.htm">Cardinal de Granvelle</a>, deprived the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and monarchical cause of its ablest champion, and thereby hastened the impending revolution. In 1556 the iconoclastic mob <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> both religious and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and sacked the churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Disorder continued until the advent of the Archduke Albert and Isabella. The people remained loyal to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a valiant defender, though <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> theories exercised at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> a certain influence particularly on <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a> and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Mechlin, Jacques Boonen (1621-55), evaded the publication of the constitution "In eminenti", by which <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> condemned the "Augustinus"; he was even temporarily suspended by <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a>. Boonen's submission did not put an end to the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> quarrels in the diocese. <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>, brought in by him, were inclined to rigorism. They opened colleges for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth and found themselves both in this field, and in their <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> views, in rivalry with the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> already active in anti-Protestant controversy. The partisans and the adversaries of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a> took sides at once with one or other of the conflicting parties. The firmness of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> at Precipiano (1690-1711) and of Cardinal d'Alsace (1715-59) repelled <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, which endured however in Josephinism and <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">Febronianism</a>. <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> suppressed many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> (1783), and created the General Seminary of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> (1786), the doctrines of which were condemned by Cardinal de Frankenberg (1759-1801). Persecution broke out afresh in the wake of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship was abolished, churches were pillaged, a multitude of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> exiled, among them Cardinal de Frankenberg. The anti-Concordat <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of the Stevenists arose under <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>. Later, King William revived the General Seminary under the name of Philosophical College, but met with as much opposition as <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Revolution of 1830 freed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from these fetters. For the later history of Mechlin see <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">BELGIUM</a>. The following <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Mechlin were made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>: <a href="../cathen/06727a.htm">Antoine Perrenot de Granvella</a>, first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> (1560-83) and a remarkable statesman; Thomas Philippe d'Alsace (1716-59); Henri de Frankenberg (1759-1801); Engelbert Sterckx (1832-67); <a href="../cathen/04665b.htm">Victor Auguste Dechamps</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator (q.v.) (1867-83); <a href="../cathen/06648a.htm">Pierre Lambert Goossens</a> (1884-1906); D&eacute;sir&eacute; Joseph Mercier (1906-), the chief originator of the neo-scholastic movement in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>.

<p>Religious monuments: numerous edifices especially of <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style (Roman: St. Germain at Tirlemont, St. Gertrude at Nivelles). At Mechlin is the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Rombaut (thirteenth and fourteenth centuries), with a tower 318 feet high. There is also Notre Dame, and St. Pierre (<a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> style). Principal other edifices: churches of Lierre, Hoogstraeten, Tirlemont, Hal, Diest; and the ruins of the Abbey of Villers, the most striking monastic ruins in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. The ornamentation has suffered greatly from the disorders of the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly the <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a> gallery at Lierre, the tabernacle at Leau, the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> at Hoogstraeten and the stained glasses in Lierre and Hoogstraeten. Of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> still preserved, many belong to the Antwerp School. At Mechlin there are works of <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a> in the churches of Notre Dame and St. Jean. See <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">ANTWERP</a>, <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">BRUSSELS</a>, LOUVAIN. Pilgrimages: St. Sang at Hoogstraeten, St. Sauveur at Haekendover (Tirlemont), Notre Dame at Montaigu, at Hal, at Hanswyck (Mechlin). Population (1909): 2,450,680 inhabitants; 745 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; 51 deaneries; one <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; 3 petits seminaires; 24 episcopal colleges; 108 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> for men, and 726 for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.

<p>The "Vie Dioc&eacute;saine" is a monthly periodical founded in 1907. The "Theologia Mechliniensis" fundamental and sacramental <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, with treatises on virtues, <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, and reserved cases fills ten volumes; notable also are the "Scripture Commentary" of Ceulemans (nine volumes) on the Psalms and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, and the work of Van der Stappen (five volumes) on the Liturgy.
