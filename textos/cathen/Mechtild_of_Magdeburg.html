<h1>Mechtild of Magdeburg</h1>  

<p>A celebrated <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> mystic, b. of a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in Saxony about 1210; d. at the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> of Helfta near Eisleben, c. 1285. She experienced her first inspirations at the age of twelve, when, as she herself states, she was greeted by the Holy Ghost. From that time, the greeting was repeated daily. Under this inspiration she desired to be despised by all without, however, deserving it, and for this purpose left her home, where she had always been <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> and respected, to become a <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguine</a> at Mageleburg in 1230. Here, under the spiritual guidance of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> she led a life of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and extreme <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>. Her heavenly inspirations and <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">ecstatic visions</a> became more frequent and were of such a nature that they dispelled from the mind of her confessor all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to their Divine origin. By his order she reluctantly wrote her visions. Shortly after 1270 she joined the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at Helfta, where she spent the remaining twelve years of her life, highly respected as one signally favoured by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, especially by her namesake <a href="../cathen/10105b.htm">St. Mechtilde</a> of Hackeborn and by St. Gertrude the Great. Mechtild left to the world a most wonderful book, in which she recorded her manifold inspirations and visions. According to her assertion, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> ordered the title of the book to be "Vliessende lieht miner gotheit in allu die herzen die da lebent ane valscheit", i.e. "Light of my divinity, flowing into all hearts that live without guile". The work is commonly styled "Das fliessende Licht der Gottheit". She wrote her inspirations on separate sheets of paper, which she handed to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Henry of Halle, <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> in Rupin. The original, which was written in Low German, is not extant, but a South German translation, which was prepared by Henry of N&ouml;rdlingen about the year 1344 is still preserved in the original <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>, Codex 277. Mechtild began the work in 1250 and finished the sixth volume at <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> in 1264, to which she added a seventh volume at Helfta. A Latin translation of the six volumes written at <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> was made by a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, about the year 1290, and is reprinted, together with a translation of the seventh volume, in "Revelationes Gertrudianse ac Mechtildianae", II (Paris, 1877), 435-707. The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a> was edited by <a href="../cathen/10564d.htm">Gall Morel, O.S.B.</a>, who also translated it into modern German (Ratisbon, 1809). Other modern German translations were prepared by J. Muller (Ratisbon, 1881) and Eseherich (Berlin, 1909).

<p>Mechtild's language is generally forcible and often exceedingly flowery. Her prose is occasionally interspersed with beautiful original pieces of poetry, which manifest that she had all the natural gifts of a poet. She is never at a loss to give vent to her feelings of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and grief in the most impressive form. Often also she delights in aphoristic and abrupt sentences. It is sometimes difficult to ascertain just how far her narrations are faithful reproductions of her visions, and how far they are additions made by her own poetic fancy. This is especially <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of her realistic description of the hereafter. Writing on <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, she says, "I saw a horrible and wretched place; its name is 'Eternal Hatred'." She then represents Lucifer as chained by his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the lowest abyss of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, agony, pestilence and ruin, that fill <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, and earth, flowing from his burning heart and mouth. She divides <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> into three parts; the lowest and most horrible is filled with condemned <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, the middle with <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and the highest with <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Pagans</a>. <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">Hell</a>, <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> are situated one immediately above the other. The lowest portion of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> is filled with devils, who torment the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the most horrible manner, while the highest portion of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> is identical with the lowest portion of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Many a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the lowest <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether it will ever be saved. The last statement was condemned in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Exsurge Domine", 15 June, 1520, as one of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>: "Animae in purgatorio non sunt securae de earum salute, saltem omnes". Mechtild's conception of the hereafter is believed by some to be the basis of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante's</a> "Divine Comedy", and the poet's Matelda ("Purgatory", Canto 27-33) to be identical with our Mechtild (see Preger, "Dante's Matelda", Munich, 1873). Whatever we may think of these and other statements in the work of Mechtild, much of it no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, has all the signs of a special inspiration from above. That she did not seek the favour of man is evident from her fearless denunciation of the vices of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in general and especially the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>. Some authors call her <em>saint</em>, though she has not been <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> and apparently has never received any public cult.
