<h1>Mediator (Christ as Mediator)</h1>  

<p>The subject will be treated under the following heads: <ol><li>Definition of the word mediator; <li>Christ the Mediator; <li>Christ's qualifications; <li>Performance; <li>Results.</ol>
<h2 id="section1">Mediator defined</h2>

<p>A mediator is one who brings estranged parties to an amicable agreement. In <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> the term invariably implies that the estranged beings are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man, and it is appropriated to Christ, the One Mediator. When special friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> &#151; <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, holy men &#151; plead our cause before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they mediate "with Christ"; their mediation is only secondary and is better called intercession. Moses, howover, is the proper mediator of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs19">Galatians 3:19-20</a>).
<h2 id="section2">Christ the Mediator</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> writes to Timothy (<a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#vrs3">1 Timothy 2:3-6</a>) . . . "God our Saviour, Who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For there is one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and one mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>: Who gave himself a <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> for all, a testimony in due times." The object of the mediatorship is here pointed out as the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and the imparting of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The mediator is named: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>; His qualification for the office is implied in His being described as man, and the performance of it is ascribed to His redeeming sacrifice and His testifying to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. All this originates in the Divine Will of "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> our Saviour, Who will have all men to be saved". <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> mediatorship, therefore, occupies the central position in the economy of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: all human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are both for time and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> dependent on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a> for their whole <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> life. "Who [<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a>] hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, In whom we have <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> through his blood, the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; Who is the image of the invisible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> of every creature . . . all things were created by him and in him. And he is before all and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> from the dead; that in all things he may hold the primacy: Because in him, it hath well pleased <em>the Father</em>, that all fulness should dwell; And through him to reconcile all things unto himself, making peace through the blood of his cross, both as to the things that are on earth, and the things that are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>". (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs13">Colossians 1:13-20</a>)
<h2 id="section3">Qualifications</h2>

<p>The perfection of a mediator is measured by his influence with the parties he has to reconcile, and this power flows from his connection with both: the highest possible perfection would be reached if the mediator were substantially one with both parties. A mother, for instance, is the best mediator between her husband and her son. But the matrimonial union of "two in one flesh", and the union of mother and child are inferior in perfection to the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Husband, mother, son, are three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man, is only one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, identical with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, identical with man. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a> makes Him the Head of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> and, therefore, its natural representative. By His human origin Christ is a member of the human <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, a partaker of our flesh and blood (<a href="../bible/heb002.htm#vrs11">Hebrews 2:11-15</a>); by reason of His Divine Personality, He is "the image and likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" to a degree unapproached by either man or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. The Incarnation establishing between the First-born and His brethren a real kinship or affinity, Christ becomes the Head of the human <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and the human <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> acquires a claim to participate in the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> privileges of their Head, "Because we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones." (<a href="../bible/eph005.htm#vrs30">Ephesians 5:30</a>). Such was the expressed will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: "But when the fulness of the time was come, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent his Son, made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> . . . that we might receive the adoption of sons." (<a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs4">Galatians 4:4-5</a>; also <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs29">Romans 8:29</a>) The man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, therefore, who was designed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to mediate between Him and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and whose mediatorship was not accidental and delegated, but inherent in His very being, was endowed with all the attributes are required in a perfect mediator.

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> function as mediator necessarily proceeds from His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as <em>principium quo operandi</em>; yet it obtains its mediating efficacy from the Divine nature, i.e. from the dignity of an acting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Its first object, as commonly stated, is the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the granting of grace, whereby the friendship between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man is restored. This object is attained by the worship of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> value which is offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by and through Christ. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, however, is mediator on the side of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as well as on the side of man: He reveals to man Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and Divine commands; He distributes the Divine gifts of grace and rules the world. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> sums up this two-sided mediation in the words: ". . . consider the apostle and <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of our confession, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>" (Heb. iii, I); <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Apostle sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to us, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> leading us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.
<h2 id="section4">Performance</h2>

<p>How do we benefit by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> mediation? Christ is more than an enlightening teacher and a bright example of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>; He destroys <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and restores grace. Our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is not due exclusively to the Mediator's intercession for us in His <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; Christ administers in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> the fruits of His work on earth (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#vrs25">Hebrews 7:25</a>). Scripture compels us to regard the work of the Mediator as an efficient cause of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: His merits and satisfaction, as being those of our representative, have obtained for us <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The oldest expression of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> formularies is in the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a>: "crucified also for us". "Vicarious satisfaction", a term now in vogue, is not found expressly in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> formularies, and us not an adequate expression of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> mediation. For His mediation partly replaces, partly renders possible and efficacious the saving work of man himself, on the other hand, it is a condition of, and it merits, the saving work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It begins with obtaining the goodwill of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> towards man, and appeasing the offended <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by interceding for man. This intercession, however, differs from a mere asking in this, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> work has merited what is asked for: salvation is its rightful equivalent. Further: to effect man's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the Saviour had to take upon Himself the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> and make satisfaction for them to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But though His atonement gives <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> than <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> gives dishonour, it is but a step towards the most essential part of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> saving work - the friendship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> which it merits for man. Taken together, the expiation of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the meriting of Divine friendship are the end of a real sacrifice, i.e. of "an action performed in order to give <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> due to Him alone, and so to gain the Divine favour" <a href="../summa/4048.htm#article3">(<em>Summa Theologica</em> III:48:3)</a>. Peculiar to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sacrifice are the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> value of Victim, which give the sacrifice an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> value of expiation and as merit. Moreover, it consists of suffering <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> accepted. The sinner deserves death, having forfeited the end for which he was created; and hence Christ accepted death as the chief feature of His atoning sacrifice.
<h2 id="section5">Results</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> saving work did not at once blot out every individual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and transform every sinner into a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, it only procured the means thereto. Personal sanctification is effected the special acts, partly Divine, partly human; it is secured by loving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and man as the Saviour did. <em>Christianus alter Christus</em>: every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is another <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, a son of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, an heir to the eternal Kingdom. Finally, in the fulness of time all things that are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and on earth shall be re-established, restored, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/eph001.htm#vrs9">Ephesians 1:9-10</a>). The meaning of the promise is that the whole of creation, bound up together and perfected in christ as its Head, shall be led back in the most perfect manner to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from whom <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had partly led it away. Christ is the Crown the Centre, and the Fountain of a new and higher order of things: "for all are yours; And you are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a>; and Christ is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>." (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm#vrs22">1 Corinthians 3:22-23</a>).
