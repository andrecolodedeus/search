<h1>Mehrerau</h1>  

<p>Formerly a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, now a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey; situated on Lake Constance, west of Bregenz, in the district of Vorarlberg, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The original <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was founded by St. Columbanus who, driven from Luxeuil, settled about 611 at this spot and built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> after the model of Luxeuil. A <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> soon arose near the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for men. Little has been preserved of the early history of either foundation up to 1079. In this year the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was reformed by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Gottfried, sent by Abbot William of Hirsau, and the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Benedictine rule</a> was introduced. It is probable that when the reform was effected the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> was suppressed. In 1097-98 the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was rebuilt by Count Ulrich of Bregenz, its secular administrator and protector. During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> acquired much landed <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>; up to the middle of the sixteenth century it had the right of patronage for sixty-five <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. In the era of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was a strong support of the old Faith in Vorarlberg. In particular Ulrich M&ouml;tz, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, exerted much influence in Bregenzerwald (a mountainous district of northern Vorarlberg) by preaching with great energy against the spread of religious innovations while he was <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of Lingenau (1515-33). During the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> suffered from the devastation wrought by the Swedes, from the quartering upon it of soldiers, and from forced contributions; it was also robbed of nearly all its revenues. Nevertheless, it often offered a free refuge to religious expelled from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. At a later date it was once more in a very flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>; in 1738 the church was completely rebuilt, and in 1774-81 the monastic buildings were also entirely reconstructed. The existence of Mehrerau was threatened, as was that of other religious foundations, by the attacks upon <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the reign of the <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a>. However, Abbot Benedict was able to obtain the withdrawal of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of suppression, although it had already been signed. The Peace of Presburg (1805) gave Vorarlberg, and with it the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, to <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, which in April, 1806, took an inventory of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. In reply to the last attempt to save the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, namely the offer to turn it into a training-school for male teachers, the State declared in August, 1806, that on 1 September the monastic organization would be dissolved and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> would have to leave the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. The valuable <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was scattered, part of it was burnt. The forest and agricultural lands belonging to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> were taken by the State; in February, 1807, the church was closed, and the other buildings were sold at auction. In 1808-09 the church was taken down and the material used to build the harbour of Landau. When the district came again under the rule of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, the monastic buildings were used for various purposes. In 1853 they were bought from the last owner, along with some pieces of land connected with them, by the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15607a.htm">Cistercian Abbey of Wettingen</a> in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. This <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> had been forcibly suppressed by the Canton of Aargau in 1841, and for thirteen years the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> had been seeking a new home; on 18 October, 1854, the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Abbey of Wettingen-Mehrerau was formally opened. In the same year a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was started. In 1859 a new Romanesque church was built; its greatest ornament is the monument to <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Cardinal Hergenr&ouml;ther</a> (died 1890), who is buried there. About the middle of the last century, during the fifties and sixties, the buildings were gradually enlarged. In 1910 besides the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> (from 1902 Eugene Notz) the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> had 32 priests; including those that had been connected with the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> but were at that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> engaged in work outside, 64 priests; in addition there were 5 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, 30 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, and 4 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> has a house of studies, and a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, in which some 200 pupils are taught by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. The periodical "Cistercienserchronik", edited by Father Gregor M&uuml;ller, has been issued since 1889.
