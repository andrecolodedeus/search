<h1>Meissen</h1>  

<p>A former see of north-east <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The present city of Meissen, situated in the Kingdom of Saxony on both banks of the Elbe, owes its origin to a castle built by King Henry I about 928 to protect German colonists among the Wends. To insure the success of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missions, <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> suggested at the Roman Synod of 962 the creation of an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> at <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>. To this proposal <a href="../cathen/08426b.htm">John XII</a> consented, and, shortly before the execution of the plan in 968, it was decided at the Synod of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> (967) to create three other sees &mdash; namely Meissen, Mersburg, and Zeitz &mdash; as suffragans of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>. The year in which the Diocese of Meissen was established is not known, the oldest extant records being forgeries; however, the record of endowment by <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> in 971 is genuine. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Burchard (died 969), established a foundation (<em>monasterium</em>) which in the course of the eleventh century developed a chapter of canons. In 1346 the diocese stretched from the Erzgebirge in the south to the mouth of the Neisse and to the Queis, on the east to the Oder, on the north to the middle course of the Spree. It embraced the five provostries of Meissen, Riesa, Wurzen, Grossenhain, and Bautzen, the four archdeaneries of Nisani (Meissen), Chemnitz, Zschillen (Wechselburg), and Niederlausitz, and the two deaneries of Meissen and Bautzen. Poorly endowed in the beginning, it appears to have acquired later large estates under <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> and Henry II.

<p>The chief task of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the new see was the conversion of the Wends, to which Bishops Volkold (died 992) and Eido (died 1015) devoted themselves with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>; but the work of evangelization was slow, and was yet incomplete when the investiture conflict threatened to arrest it effectively. St. Benno (1066-1106), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at the time when these troubles were most serious, was appointed by Henry IV and appears to have been in complete accord with the emperor until 1076; in that year, however, although he had taken no part in the Saxon revolt, he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by Henry for nine months. Escaping, he joined the Saxon princes, espoused the cause of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, and in 1085 took part in the Gregorian Synod of Quedlinburg, for which he was deprived of his office by the emperor, a more imperially disposed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> being appointed in his place. On the death of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a>, Benno made peace with Henry, and, being reappointed to his former see in 1086, devoted himself entirely to missionary work among the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>. Among his successors, Herwig (died 1119) sided with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Godebold with the emperor. In the thirteenth century the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Wends were finally <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, chiefly through the efforts of the great <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, the most important of which were Dobrilugk and Neuzelle. Among the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> Heiligenkreuz at Meissen, Mariental near Zittau, Marienstern on the White Elster, and M&uuml;hlberg deserve mention. Among the later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who were after the thirteenth century princes of the empire, the most notable are Wittigo I (1266-93) and John I of Eisenberg (1340-71). The former began the magnificent Gothic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, in which are buried nine princes of the House of Wettin; the latter, as notary and intimate friend of the Margrave of Meissen, afterwards the Emperor Charles IV, protected the interests of his church and increased the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. During the latter's administration, in 1344, Prague was made an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a>.

<p>In 1365 <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a> appointed the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a> <em>legatus natus</em>, or perpetual representative of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, for the Dioceses of Meissen, <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Regensburg (Ratisbon)</a>; the opposition of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> made it impossible to exercise in Meissen the privileges of this office, and Meissen remained, though under protest, subject to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>. John's successor, John II of Jenstein (1376-9), who resigned Meissen on his election to the See of Prague, <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> (1379-92), John III (1393-8), and Thimo of Colditz (1399-1410) were appointed directly from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which set aside the elective <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. Thimo, a <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> by birth, neglected the diocese and ruined it financially. Margrave William I of Saxony prevailed on <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> in 1405 to free Meissen from the authority of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and to place it directly under the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The illustrious Bishop Rudolf von der Planitz (1411-27), through wise regulations and personal <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, brought order out of chaos. The Hussite <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> caused great damage to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, then ruled over by John IV Hofmann (1427-51); under the government of the able brothers Caspar (1451-63) and Dietrich of Sch&ouml;nberg (1461-76), it soon recovered and on Dietrich's death there was a fund of 8800 gold forms in the episcopal treasury. John V of Weissenbach (1476-87) through his mania for building and his travels soon spent this money, and left a heavy burden of <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> on the diocese. John VI of Salhausen (1488-1518) further impoverished the diocese through his obstinate attempt to obtain full sovereignty over his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, which brought him into constant conflict with Duke George of Saxony; his spiritual administration was also open to censure. John VII of Schleinitz (1518-37) was a resolute opponent of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, whose revolt began in the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, and, conjointly with George of Saxony, endeavoured to crush the innovations. The <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of Benno (1523), urged by him, was intended to offset the progress of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> teaching. John VIII of Maltitz (1537-49) and <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a> of Carlowitz (1549-55) were unable to withstand the ever-spreading <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, which, after the death of Duke George (1539), triumphed in <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a> and gained ground even among the canons of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, so that the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was on the verge of dissolution. The last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, John of Haugwitz (1555-81), placed his resignation in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, in virtue of an agreement with Elector Augustus of Saxony, went over to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, married, and retired to the castle of Ruhetal near m&ouml;geln. The electors of Saxony took over the administration of the temporalities of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> which in 1666 were finally adjudged to them. The canons turned <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, and such <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> as still existed were secularized, their revenues and buildings being devoted principally to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> works.
