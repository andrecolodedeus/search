<h1>Melbourne</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> of Melbourne (Melburnen)

<p>Located in the state of <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a>, Southeastern Australia. Its history is closely interwoven with the rise and progress of the state of <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a>. When the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Melbourne was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1848, the present <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>, from which the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> takes its name, was known as the Port Philip Settlement, and was part of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>. <a href="../cathen/12201a.htm">Dr. Polding</a>, the newly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that see, placed the Rev. Patrick Bonaventure Geoghegan in charge of Port Philip in 1839; and the first <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated in Melbourne on Pentecost Sunday, 15 May, of that year. The entire population of Port Philip in 1841 was 11,738, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> numbered 2411.

<p>(1) Most Rev. James Alypius Goold, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, an Irishman, journeyed overland from <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a> after his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, arriving in Melbourne 4 October, 1848. In April, 1850, he laid the foundation of St. Patrick's <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and this event was followed in a few months by a declaration by the imperial authorities which changed the Settlement of Port Philip into the independent colony of <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a>. The discovery of goldfields at <a href="../cathen/02223a.htm">Ballarat</a>, Bendigo, and Castlemaine at this period was responsible for a large increase in the population. <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> found in Victoria a refuge and a home for many of her exiled children. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, in 1851 only 18,000, had by 1857 grown to 88,000.

<p>During the next decade and a half large centres of population had sprung up in places so remote from Melbourne that it was utterly impossible for Bishop Goold to attend to the wants of his widely scattered flock. When at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1874 he placed his difficulties before the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and had the northern and western portions of <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a> cut off from Melbourne and formed into the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/13436a.htm">Sandhurst</a> and Ballarat, and received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> as first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of Melbourne and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a>. The strain of getting through <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> work in the pioneering days of <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a> demanded a strength and a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> firmness of no ordinary capacity. The work accomplished by Archbishop Goold from 1848 to 1886 proves him a man of wonderful endurance and great organizing ability. He made five voyages to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and introduced several <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders devoted to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit fathers</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>, <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, Good Shepherd Nuns, Presentation Order, Faithful Companions of Jesus, and <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>. The most important action of Dr. Goold and most far-reaching in its consequences was the determined and consistent fight he made against the state system of purely secular <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he displayed in the erection of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and the sacrifice he demanded of his people in maintaining them, show how fully convinced he was that religious instruction can never be separated from <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. When the denominational system in 1872 gave way to a system from which the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was banished, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> proclaimed that no matter what the cost, or what the sacrifice involved, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children of <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a> should be provided with a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. When Archbishop Goold died, 11 June, 1886, there were 11,661 children receiving <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> without costing a penny to the state, while their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were contributing their share as taxpayers to the state system.

<p>(2) Most Rev. Thomas Joseph Carr, on the solid foundation laid by his predecessor, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Melbourne, has raised a stately and imposing edifice. The present <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> was transferred from the ancient see of <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>, and arrived in Melbourne on the first anniversary of Dr. Goold's death, 11 June, 1887. The years after his arrival he undertook the great task of completing St. Patrick's <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. For over forty years the building of this magnificent temple absorbed every thought of the first <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a>, the Right Rev. John Fitzpatrick, D. D. Yet a sum of one hundred thousand pounds was requested to carry out the original design, exclusive of the towers which are still unfinished. On the death of Dr. Fitzpatrick in 1889 the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> enlisted the practical sympathy and hearty co-operation of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> of the archdiocese in this large undertaking. On 31 October, 1897, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, entirely free from <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>. The total cost from the day the foundation stone was laid in April, 1850, to the day of dedication was two hundred thirty thousand pounds. No modern <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> approaches the Melbourne fane, and even the two ancient <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, Christ's church and St. Patrick's, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, fall far short in seating accommodation and massive beauty. The episcopal silver jubilee of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was celebrated 26 August, 1907, with unbounded enthusiasm, while 10,000 found standing or sitting room with the walls of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> took occasion of this celebration to mark their appreciation of Archbishop Carr's great services to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Australia during the twenty years of his rule. Because of his deeply rooted objection to a personal testimonial, a <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> of eight thousand pounds was cleared off the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> hall and a thousand pounds over-subscribed handed him for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> purposes. In connection with that event, a review was made, and official statistics compiled, of the growth and progress of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in that period. The number of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> had increased from 66 to 142, 30 new churches had been built, old churches had been replaced by substantial and stately edifices, and the existing ones improved in ornamentation and equipment, and the number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> had risen from 26 to 56. The total cost of the erection of the churches, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, presbyteries, halls, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> amounted to the enormous sum (considering the population) of &#163;1,272,874.

<p>The development of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and the increase in the number of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> not only kept pace with the general growth, but led the van of progress. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> adhered religiously to the principles of his predecessor in his endeavour to provide, as far as possible, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for every <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> child. To make effective and permanent provision in the department of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, new teaching orders were introduced. In addition to those already fighting the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> battle, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, within a few years, had the Marist Brothers, the Sisters of Charity, the Sacred Heart Sisters, the Sisters of Loretto, the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06647b.htm">Sisters of the Good Samaritan</a>. &#163;500,679 was expended during these twenty years on <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> buildings and residence for religious engaged in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. In 1887 the number of pupils attending the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the archdiocese was 11,661, as compared with 25,369 at the close of 1908. The building and maintaining of a separate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system means a double tax on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> community; as rate-payers they contribute their share of State <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> they pay for their own; and count the cost as nothing compared with the eternal interests at stake. When the purely secular system of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was introduced into Victoria in 1872, some anti-Catholics leagued together, and declared that the new system would "rend the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church asunder". The opposite had been the result. The very sufferings and disabilities associated with the maintenance of their own <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> have united solidly the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body; while the absence of religion from the state <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> has "rent asunder" <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in producing a generation of non-believers. No review of the Archdiocese of Melbourne would be complete without reference to the growth of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature, particularly in recent years. To stem the tide of irreligious reading, splendid efforts have been made in Melbourne to provide <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> homes with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature. When the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> came to Melbourne (1887), there was only one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper, "The Advocate", in <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a>. Since then a monthly magazine, the "Austral Light", under his direction (1892), and the Australian <a href="../cathen/15077a.htm">Catholic Truth Society</a> (1904), have come into existence and are doing great apostolic work in diffusing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the archdiocese are almost all <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> or of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> origin. The <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was exclusively <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> till recent years, when vocations among the native born are rapidly on the increase. The religious, teaching in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> or conducting the <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, were in the early days <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, but are now largely Australian.
