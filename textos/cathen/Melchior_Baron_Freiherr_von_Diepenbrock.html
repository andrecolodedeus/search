<h1>Melchior, Baron (Freiherr) von Diepenbrock</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> and Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, b. 6 January, 1798, at Boeholt in <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>; d. at the castle of Johannisberg in Upper Silesia, 20 January, 1853. He attended the military academy at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a> and took part in the campaign against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1815 as an officer of the militia. Upon his return he was much attracted by the <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> of Johann Michael Sailer, a friend of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, at that time professor at the University of Landshut in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and studied public finance at that institution. When Sailer was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, Diepenbrock followed him thither, took up the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 27 December, 1823. In 1835 he was made dean of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> by the successor of Bishop Sailer. His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of modern languages and his administrative ability, together with his profound understanding of the interior life and his ascetical character, paved the way for his elevation to the episcopal <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">See of Breslau</a>, to which he was elected 15 January, 1845. He at first declined the honor, but finally accepted out of filial obedience to the mandate of <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a>.

<p>From the beginning of his reign he was called to face difficult problems and momentous political events. Sectarian propagandism was especially aggressive in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and was furthered by state officials as well as by the traditional enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The famine in Upper Silesia appealed to his sympathetic and generous nature. The Revolution of 1848 showed him one of the firmest and most loyal supporters of government, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and order. The pastoral letter which he issued on this occasion was, by order of the king, read in all the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> churches of the realm. He devoted his best energies to the training of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, opened a preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and improved the conditions of the higher <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. He was a watchful guardian of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> and, when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, employed severe measures to enforce it. He reintroduced, with great success, retreats for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and missions for the people.

<p>In 1849 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> army and relieved, to a great extent, the sore needs of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> soldiers. He was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in the consistory of 20 September, 1850, and received the purple 4 November. This event gave occasion to one of the most magnificent public demonstrations ever witnessed in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. It was soon followed by another demonstration, equally striking, but sorrowful in character, on the occasion of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> death from a disease which had long afflicted him. His will bequeathed his estate to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Cardinal Diepenbrock's episcopate was fruitful in <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> for Upper Silesia, he was a champion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> for the whole of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and an ornament to the entire Church. In personal appearance he was of dignified presence, but pleasant and affable to all. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> was a noted preacher and poet, and his writings bear evidence to his talents. His principal publications are: "Spiritual Bouquet, Gathered in Spanish and German Gardens of Poesy" (Sulzbach, 1826); "Life and Writings of Heinrich Suso" (Ratisbon, 1829); "Sermons" (Ratisbon, 1841); "Pastoral Letters" (Munster, 1853); "Personal Letters" (Frankfort, 1860).
