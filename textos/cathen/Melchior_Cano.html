<h1>Melchior Cano</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. 1 Jan., 1509, at Taranc&oacute;n, <a href="../cathen/04562b.htm">Province of Cuenca</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; d. 30 Sept., 1560, at Toledo.

<p>His father, Ferdinand Cano, a learned jurist, sent him at an early age to the <a href="../cathen/13392a.htm">University of Salamanca</a>. There in 1523 he entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, and was professed at St. Stephen's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, 12 Aug., 1524. Francis de Victoria, who held the first chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, was his professor from 1527 to 1531. Cano was then sent to St. Gregory's College at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, where, with <a href="../cathen/09385b.htm">Louis of Granada</a> among others, he heard the lectures of <a href="../cathen/03376a.htm">Bartholomew of Carranza</a>. After teaching philosophy for a time he became master of students, 1534, and was promoted to the second chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, 1536. The same year the baccalaureate was conferred upon him by a general chapter of the order at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1542, while attending another general chapter, he was made master of sacred <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, and on his return to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> obtained the first chair at <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a>. After the death of <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a>, 17 Aug., 1546 Cano was a successful competitor for his chair at Salamanca, and he held the title until 1552. Early in 1551 he was sent by the emperor to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. He was accompanied by Dominic Soto, and, like other members of the order, was enabled by his historical erudition and his mastery of scholastic and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">positive theology</a> to render important service in the deliberations and achievements of the council. The following year <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> presented him for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03243a.htm">Canary Islands</a>; but a month after he was <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a> he resigned. In 1553 he returned to St. Gregory's College at Valladolid as <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, but was not charged with active professorial <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. In 1557, after being elected <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of St. Stephen's at Salamanca, he was made provincial. This election was contested, and among those who opposed Cano was <a href="../cathen/03376a.htm">Carranza</a>, who had become <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Toledo and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Another provincial chapter renewed and confirmed the proceedings of the former but the re-election was annulled by <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Pope Paul IV</a>, who regarded Cano with disfavour for supporting the Spanish Court in some of its disagreements with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. On this pontiff's death Cano personally repaired to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and obtained the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of his election from the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>. He returned to Toledo in the spring of 1560, and died there the same year.

<p>The character of Cano has been assailed by some writers, who represent him as a man of immoderate <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and sometimes of intemperate action. He is charged among other things with having been a party to the misfortunes of Don Carlos and to the persecutions of <a href="../cathen/03376a.htm">Carranza</a>. Against these accusations he is ably defended by <a href="../cathen/15001b.htm">Father Touron</a>, the learned <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> historian and biographer. Cano undoubtedly displayed great energy, vehemence, and determination in the pursuit of his aims. Early in his career at Valladolid he became involved in scholastic controversy with <a href="../cathen/03376a.htm">Carranza</a>, and their continuous disputes, besides placing them at the head of rival <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of thought, cast a shadow over all their subsequent relations. Cano is also said to have for some time defeated the wish of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to establish themselves in Salamanca. His strictures, which made a great stir were published about the time of the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society</a>, but were withdrawn from publication in 1777. They were republished in "Crisis de la Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a de Jes&uacute;s" (Barcelona, 1900), 152-159. Cano's advice in important affairs of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> was often sought. Though possessing the full confidence of Philip II, he declined in 1554 the position of confessor to the king.

<p>In whatever light his personal traits may appear Cano made an imperishable name for himself in his work, "De Locis Theologicis" (Salamanca, 1563), which in classic elegance and purity of style approaches the great didactic treatises of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Cicero, and Quintillian. It certainly ranks with the most lauded productions of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> not only on account of its fluency and freedom but also for its lucid judgment and profound erudition. In the estimation of some critics this work marking a new epoch in the history of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> has made its author worthy of a place next to <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>. The "De Locis" was the outcome of a movement inaugurated by Francis de Victoria to restore the best patristic learning and to give to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological science</a> a purer diction and an improved literary form. Cano took up the work of his master, and after years of labour gave out the production that was worthy of their united aspirations and endeavours. It was Cano's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> to establish scientifically the foundations of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological science</a>, and therefore the "De Locis" is a treatise on <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> method. After elucidating the distinction between arguments based on authority and arguments from reason, the author enumerates ten <em>loci</em>, or sources of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, each the subject of a book. With admirable precision and clearness he treats successively the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, oral tradition, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Councils, the Fathers the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, the value of natural reason as manifested in <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, the authority of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and the authority of history. The twelfth and last book treats of the use and application of these <em>loci, </em>or sources, in scholastic debate or <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> polemics. Two further books on the <em>loci </em>as applicable to Scriptural exposition and as employed against various classes of adversaries of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were contemplated by Cano, but he was overtaken by death before he completed his work. A standard quarto edition of the "De Locis Theologicis" (Padua, 1714) was edited by Hyacinth Serry, with a "Prologus Galeatus" defending Cano against his critics. This is followed by most of the subsequent editions, some twenty in all. Two other treatises, "De Sacramentis" and "De Poenitenti&acirc;", are not so well known, but they show the same character of solidity and clearness of method, and the same elegant Latinity.
