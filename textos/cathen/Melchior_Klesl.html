<h1>Melchior Klesl</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and Austrian statesman, b. at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 19 February, 1552; d. at <a href="../cathen/15618c.htm">Wiener-Neustadt</a>, 18 September, 1630. While <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was governed by <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal Richelieu</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> also had her cardinal minister of State; but whereas the former had but one <em>journ&eacute;e des dupes</em>, the latter lamented his downfall for years. Klesl's <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was a baker. He studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a>, and was with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> brought into the fold of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the court <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, <a href="../cathen/13527c.htm">Father Georg Scherer, S.J.</a> He received <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> in 1577, when he was assigned a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a>, and, even while in <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, he preached and held conferences at Korneuburg and in the vicinity, making many conversions. In 1579 he became doctor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of St. Stephen's at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, which dignity carried with it the chancellorship of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and was finally <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. As early as the following year he was appointed councillor of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a> for Lower <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Rudolf II, impressed by the vigour and success of his campaign against <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, entrusted him with the work of the counter-Reformation, which became his life work. He brought back into the fold the cities of <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, Krems, and Stein, though not without great difficulty, nor indeed without actual risk of his life. In 1585 he was made imperial councillor by Rudolf II, who three years later appointed him court <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and administrator of the Diocese of Wiener-Neustadt. It took him but a very short time to restore the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rule in this thoroughly disorganized <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. He was compelled in doing so to be constantly on his guard against the monastic council, which, in a memorial on the subject, he calls, "the cause of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the champion of godless <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> against their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, a parasite".

<p>In 1598 Klesl was named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, which was spiritually and materially in a state of degradation. He was not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> until 1614, and received the purple from <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> in 1616. In 1611 Matthias placed Klesl at the head of his privy council. As such he held full sway in the Govermnent. He himself admits that he "spoke, wrote, and negotiated" for the emperor. It was the question of the succession to the throne which caused his downfall. Klesl had every reason to fear that his influence would wane, if Archduke Ferdinand were once formally declared to be the heir apparent. For this reason he delayed the settlement of this question. When the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>, having thrown their governor out of the window of the palace at Prague for the second time, broke out into open rebellion, and Klesl could not be induced to take energetic measures against them, the Archdukes Max of Tyrol and Ferdinand of Steiermark caused the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> (20 July, 1618) to be seized in an antechamber of undecided emperor, and had him conveyed to the fortress of Ambra. A few days later he was brought to the castle of Innsbruck, whence he was transferred after a year to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Georgenberg. In November, 1622, the Castle of Sant' Angelo in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> became his place of confinement. He was granted his freedom by the emperor in June of the following year, but was to remain in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He lived to enjoy the satisfaction of seeing himself solemnly brought back to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> on 25 January, 1628, and reinstated as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He decreed that the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December be henceforth observed in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> "in the same manner as Sundays and other prescribed holy days", and in spite of the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio's</a> protestation, he strove to maintain the peculiarly <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Viennese</a> custom whereby <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> was distributed on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>. His heart reposes before the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15618c.htm">Wiener-Neustadt</a>, while his body rests in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Stephen's.
