<h1>Melchisedech</h1>  

<p>[Gr. <em>Melchisedek</em>, from the Hebrew meaning "King of righteousness (Gesenius)] was King of Salem (Gen. xiv, 18-20) who, on Abraham's return with the booty taken from the four kings, "bringing forth <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>, for he was the priest of the most high God, blessed him", and received from him "the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of all" (v. 20). <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, with many others, identifies Salem with <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and adds that Melchisedech "supplied Abram's army in a hospitable manner, and gave them provisions in abundance. . .and when Abram gave him the tenth part of his prey, he accepted the gift" (Ant., I, x, 2). Cheyne says "it is a plausible conjecture that he is a purely fictitious personage" (Encyc. Bib., s.v.), which "plausible conjecture" Kaufmann, however, rightly condemns (<a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>. Encyc., s.v.). The Rabbins identified Melchisedech with Sem, son of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, rather for polemic than historic reasons, since they wished to set themselves against what is said of him as a type of Christ "without father, without mother, without genealogy" (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#vrs3">Hebrews 7:3</a>). In the Epistle to the Hebrews the typical character of Melchisedech and its <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> import are fully explained. Christ is "a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> forever according to the order of Melchisedech" (<a href="../bible/heb007.htm#vrs6">Hebrews 7:6</a>; <a href="../bible/psa109.htm#vrs4">Psalm 109:4</a>); "a high priest forever", etc (<a href="../bible/heb006.htm#vrs20">Hebrews 6:20</a>), i.e. order or manner (Gesenius), not after the manner of Aaron. The Apostle develops his teaching in <a href="../bible/heb007.htm">Hebrews 7</a>: Melchisedech was a type by reason <ul> <li>of his twofold dignity as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and king, <li>by reason of his name, "king of justice", <li>by reason of the city over which he ruled, "King of Salem, that is, king of peace" (v. 2), and also <li>because he "without father without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened unto the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, continueth a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> forever." (v. 3).</ul> The silence of Scripture about the facts of Melchisedech's birth and death was part of the divine plan to make him prefigure more strikingly the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> generation, the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of His <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Abraham, patriarch and father of nations, paid <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to Melchisedech and received his blessing. This was all the more remarkable since the priest-king was a stranger, to whom he was not bound to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, as were the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Aaronic line. Abraham, therefore, and Levi "in the loins of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>" (Heb. vii, 9), by acknowledging his superiority as a type of Christ (for personally he was not greater than Abraham), thereby confessed the excellence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Neither can it be fairly objected that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was in the loins of Abraham as Levi was, and paid <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to Melchisedech; for, though descended from Abraham, he had no human father, but was conceived by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. In the history of Melchisedech <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> says nothing about the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> which the "<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">most High</a>" offered, and on account of which his name is placed in the Canon of the Mass. The scope of the Apostle accounts for this; for he wishes to show that the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of Christ was in dignity and duration superior to that of Aaron, and therefore, since it is not what Melchisedech offered, but rather the other circumstances of his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> which belonged to the theme, they alone are mentioned.
