<h1>Meletius of Lycopolis</h1>  

<p>Meletius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09468a.htm">Lycopolis</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, gave his name to a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of short duration. There is uncertainty as to the dates of his birth, his death, and his episcopate. It is known, however, that he was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the above-mentioned city as early as 303, since in a council held about 306 at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> by Peter, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of that city, Meletius was deposed for several reasons, among others for sacrificing to idols. Meagre references by <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> were our only source of information until important documents were discovered in the eighteenth century by <a href="../cathen/16058b.htm">Scipio Maffei</a> at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> in a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> dealing with the Meletian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. The three documents preserved in Latin are undoubtedly authentic. There is first, a letter of protest by four <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Hesychius, Pachomius, Theodore, and Phileas, dating at the latest from 307, from the very beginning of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Meletius, and before the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of the latter who was termed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <em>dilectus comminister in Domino</em> (beloved fellow minister in the Lord). "We have heard", said the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, "grievous reports regarding Meletius who is accused of troubling the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">divine law</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rules. Quite recently, a number of witnesses having confirmed the reports, we feel compelled to write this letter. Meletius is undoubtedly aware of the very ancient law which forbids a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to ordain outside his own diocese. Nevertheless, without regard for this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and without consideration for the great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and father, <a href="../cathen/11771a.htm">Peter of Alexandria</a>, and the incarcerated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, he has created general confusion. To vindicate himself he will perhaps declare that he was compelled to act thus, as the congregations were without <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>. Such a defence however, is worthless, as a number of visitors (<em>circumeuntes</em>) had been appointed. Were they neglectful of their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, their case should have been presented before the incarcerated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. If the latter had been <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>, he could have appealed to <a href="../cathen/11771a.htm">Peter of Alexandria</a>, and thus have obtained the authority to ordain". Second, an anonymous note added to the foregoing letter and worded thus: "Meletius having received the letter and read it, paid no attention to the protest and presented himself neither before the incarcerated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/11771a.htm">Peter of Alexandria</a>. After all these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> had died in their dungeons at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, he immediately repaired to that city. Among other intriguers there were two, a certain Isidore and one Arius, seemingly honourable, both of them desirous of being admitted to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Aware of the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of Meletius and what he sought, they hastened to him, and gave him the names of the visitors (<em>circumeuntes</em>) appointed by Peter. Meletius <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> them and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> two others, one of them detained in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, the other in the mines." On learning this, Peter wrote to his Alexandrian flock. Here comes the third document, in which occurs the phrase interpreted as follows: "Having heard", said Peter, "that Meletius, without considering the letter of the blessed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, has intruded himself into my diocese, and deprived my deputies of their power, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> others, I advise you to avoid all communion with him until I can bring him before me face to face in the presence of prudent men, and investigate this affair".

<p>The conduct of Meletius was all the more reprehensible in as much as his insubordination was that of one in very high office. <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> and Theodore tell us that Meletius stood next in rank to <a href="../cathen/11771a.htm">Peter of Alexandria</a>, of whom he was jealous and whom he was basely endeavouring to supplant at the moment, when Peter was forced to flee from <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and live in hiding. It was not only against Peter, but also against his immediate successors, Achillas and Alexander, that Meletius maintained his <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> position. This we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from St. Athanasius, an authoritative witness. Comparing the information given us by St. Athanasius with that furnished by the documents above, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the beginning of the Meletian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> may be determined with fair accuracy. It was evidently during the episcopate of Peter, who occupied the <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">See of Alexandria</a> from 300 to 311. Now St. Athanasius in his "Epistola ad episcopos" states positively that "the Meletians were declared schismatics over fifty-five years ago". Unfortunately the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of this letter is contested; the choice lies between 356 or 361. However, St. Athanasius adds: "The Arians were declared heretical thirty-six years ago", i.e. at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (325). Apparently, therefore, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> was writing in 361. If now we deduct fifty-five years, we have the year 306 for the condemnation of the Meletian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; and as the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> raged bitterly between 303 and 305, the beginnings of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> seem to belong to the year 304, or 305. <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13393a.htm">Salamis</a> in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> gives a circumstantial account (Haer. lxviii) in contradiction with the foregoing narrative. According to him, the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> arose from a disagreement between Meletius and Peter regarding the reception of certain of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, particularly of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, who had <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> the Faith during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. This account, preferred by some historians to the statement of St. Athanasius, is no longer credible since the discovery of the aforesaid documents by <a href="../cathen/16058b.htm">Maffei</a> at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>. How, then, explain the origin of the account given by Epiphanius? It seems to us it arose in this manner: after Peter's death Meletius was arrested and sent to the mines; on his way, he stopped at <a href="../cathen/05380a.htm">Eleutheropolis</a>, and there founded a church of his <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>; Eleutheropolis being the native town of Epiphanius, the latter naturally came in contact with Meletians in his early days. They would of course represent in a most favourable light the origin of their <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>; and thus their partial and misleading narrative was afterwards inserted by Epiphanius in his great work on <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. Finally, the references to the Meletian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> by <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> and Theodoret quite accord with the original documents discovered at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, and more or less with what St. Athanasius has upon the same subject. As to St. Augustine, he merely mentions the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in passing and very likely follows <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>.

<p>The suppression of the Meletian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was one of the three important matters that came before the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a>. Its <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> has been preserved in the synodical epistle addressed to the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Meletius, it was decided, should remain in his own city of <a href="../cathen/09468a.htm">Lycopolis</a>, but without exercising authority or the power of ordaining; moreover he was forbidded to go into the environs of the town or to enter another diocese for the purpose of ordaining its subjects. He retained his episcopal title, but the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by him were to receive again the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>, the ordinations performed by Meletius being therefore regarded as invalid. Throughout the diocese where they were found, those <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by him were always to yield precedence to those <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Alexander, nor were they to do anything without the consent of Bishop Alexander. In the event of the death of a non-Meletian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or ecclesiastic, the vacant preferment might be given to a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Meletian, provided he were worthy and the popular election were ratified by Alexander. As to Meletius himself, episcopal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and prerogatives were taken from him owing to his incorrigible habit of everywhere exciting confusion. These mild measures, however, were in vain; the Meletians joined the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and did more harm than ever, being among the worst enemies of St. Athanasius. Referring to this attempt at reunion the latter said: "Would to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> it had never happened."

<p>About 325 the Meletians counted in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> twenty-nine <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Meletius included, and in Alexandria itself, four <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, three <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and one army <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>. Conformably to the Nicene <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, Meletius lived first at <a href="../cathen/09468a.htm">Lycopolis</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14561a.htm">Thebaid</a>, but after the negotiations which united his party to the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death is not known. He nominated his friend, John, as his successor. Theodoret mentions very <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> Meletian <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who practised Jewish ablutions. The Meletians died out after the middle of the fifth century.
