<h1>Melitene</h1>  

<p>The residence of an <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> see, also a titulary <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>. According to Pliny (Nat. Hist. VI, 3), the city was founded by Queen Semiramis at a little distance from the Euphrates; the earliest mention of it is found in Tacitus (Annal., XV, 26). A Roman camp was there under <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> made it the principal stronghold of this frontier. Its name is probably derived from the river Melas which empties into the Euphrates. Under <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a> the <em>Legio XII fulminata</em> was stationed there (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, H, E. V, v, 4); to this legion belonged the forty <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of <a href="../cathen/13667a.htm">Sebaste</a>. Ptolemy (V, vi, 21) and Strabo (XII i, 2, 4; see also XI, xii, 2; XI, xiv, 2) make it one of the ten provinces of Cappadocia. Justinian fortified it and filled it with magnificent monuments (Procopius, De &AElig;dificiis, III, 4), which have all disappeared. In 577 the Romans gained a great victory over the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> in the vicinity of Melitene; two years before the city had been burned by the Shah Chosroes. Towards the middle of the seventh century Melitene again became Byzantine; it was afterwards taken by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> and later recaptured by <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> Copronymus in 751. The latter transported the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> population to Thrace, dispersed the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> of the province, destroyed the city and razed the walls. In 760 Caliph Al-Manzur took possession of it and restored to it something of its former importance. In the tenth century the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> re-established their domination and in 965 the Emperor Nicephorus Phocas successfully undertook to colonize the region. The Greek Government had faithfully promised not to molest the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> or Syrian; but it did not keep its promise. In the eleventh century the city counted no less than fifty-six churches, and was able to furnish 60,000 armed men from among its own citizens and its environs, an index of its great prosperity. The number of suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> increased at this time and was suddenly changed from three to nine (Gelzer, "Ungedruckte . . . Texte der Notiti&aelig; episcopatuum", 579). The <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> had at that time seven sees in the vicinity of Melitene (Barhebr&aelig;us, H. E. II, 460). The city fell afterwards into the power of the Seljuk <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> of <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a>; then of the Mongols in 1235; of the Osmanlis in 1396; of Timur in 1401; then of different <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> princes. Finally, at the beginning of the sixteenth century it was annexed to the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Ottoman Empire</a>, of which it is still a part.

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> seems to have reached Melitene very early. The Roman soldier, St. Polyeuctus, immortalized by <a href="../cathen/04374b.htm">Corneille</a>, was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> there in 254 or 259. Another third century <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> is known, St. Eudoxius, whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were found in 966, as indicated by an inscription carved on the door of a church. St. Meletius, the celebrated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, was a native of Melitene, as was also <a href="../cathen/05630b.htm">Saint Euthymius</a>, to whom was chiefly due the organization of monastic life in Palestine during the fifth century. A council against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> was held there in 363. <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> (Oriens Christianus, I, 439-46) gives a long list of its Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the last of whom belongs to the year 1193. Among them are <a href="../cathen/01083a.htm">St. Acacius</a>, who died about 438; and Saint Domitian, first cousin to the Emperor Maurice, who played a most important r&ocirc;le in the religious and political life of the second half of the sixth century. For its Jacobite <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> see <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> (II, 1451-58) and "Revue de l'Orient chr&eacute;tien" (VI, 201). Today the city of Malatia forms a sanjak of the vilayet of Mamouret-ul-Aziz; it numbers about 30,000 inhabitants of whom 16,000 are <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>; 4500 Kurds; 6500 Kizil Bach (a <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>); and about 3000 <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>. Among the last mentioned are 800 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> have established there a mission with a church built in 1884 and an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>. The city, which was disturbed by an earthquake in 1893, was still more sorely troubled by the massacres of 1895, during which 500 houses were burned and 1000 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> massacred. About five miles from Malatia is the village of Eski-Malatia on the site of the ancient Melitene; a part of the walls is still preserved. The whole region is like an immense fruit garden in a delightful climate and a well-watered land. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> diocese numbers 5100 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, 9 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 10 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 7 stations, 9 primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and an establishment of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Sisters of the Immaculate Conception. The <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is under the <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">Catholicos</a> of Sis. There is also established there a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> mission.
