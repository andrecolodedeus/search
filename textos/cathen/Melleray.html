<h1>Melleray</h1>  

<p>(MELLEARIUM)

<p>Melleray, situated in Brittany (Loire-Inf&eacute;rieure), <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Diocese of Nantes</a>, in the vicinity of <a href="../cathen/03640a.htm">Chateaubriand</a>, was founded about the year 1134. Foulques, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Pontron, in Anjou, founded from Loroux (a daughter of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>), sent <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> for the foundation of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in Brittany. They were delighted with the solitude of a place near Old Melleray, shown them by Rivallon, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Auvern&eacute;, which Alain de Moisdon, proprietor of the place, donated to them. Guitern, the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, erected the original <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in 1145, but the church was not completed until 1183, under Geffroy, the fourth <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Melleray, a small <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> built for about twelve religious, remained regular until during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when relaxation prevailed as a result of the acquisition of great wealth and the introduction of the system of commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>. Etienne de Brez&eacute; (1544) was the first <a href="../cathen/04155b.htm">commendatory abbot</a>, and from his time both spiritual and temporal welfare declined, until toward the end of the seventeenth century when, through the efforts of Dom Jouard, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the order, the rule of <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> was re-introduced, and the monastic buildings restored. In 1791 it was suppressed, and the few religious were dispersed. This, however, was not the end of Melleray. The <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>, expelled from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, took refuge at Val Sainte, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>; from there, urged by their rapid increase, and for fear of the spread of the revolution, Dom Augustine de Lestrange established them in various parts of the world. Through the generosity of Sir Thomas Weld, a wealthy English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, the father of Cardinal Weld, they settled (1795) at Lulworth, Dorsetshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was soon created an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and Dom Antoine* was elected the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> (1813). In 1817, with changed conditions and the restoration of the Bourbons, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Lulworth returned to Melleray. The restored <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> flourished, increasing from fifty-seven to one hundred and ninety-two members in twelve years. During the Revolution of 1830 they were again <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, especially those of foreign birth, of whom they had a great number. To make homes for these they founded Mount Melleray (1833) in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and Mount Saint Bernard (1835) in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Dom Antoine* (d. 1839) was succeeded first by Dom Maxime, then by a second Dom Antoine, and finally by Dom Eugene Vachette, the present <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Under Dom Antoine* II several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were established, among them Gethsemani, in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Dom Eug&egrave;ne, elected in 1875, was for many years the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the Congregation of La Grande Trappe, and was instrumental in effecting the reunion of the three congregations into one order (1892). Since then he has been vicar to the Most Reverend General of the Reformed <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>. Recently he has established an annex to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in Woodbarton, <a href="../cathen/12171b.htm">Diocese of Plymouth</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.
<h2>Mount Melleray</h2>

<p>Situated on the slopes of the Knockmealdown Mountains, near Cappoquin, Diocese of Waterford, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, was founded in 1833. Father Vincent Ryan was chosen leader of the religious sent by Dom Antoine, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Melleray, for this foundation. After many efforts to locate his community he accepted the offer of Sir Richard Keane, of Cappoquin, to rent a tract of barren mountain waste, some five hundred acres, subsequently increased to seven hundred. In the work of reclaiming the soil, they were assisted by the country folk; entire <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, led by their <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, came, each in turn, to give free a full day's work. In 1833 the <a href="../cathen/14303a.htm">corner-stone</a> was laid by Sir Richard Keane, in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and a large concourse of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people. In 1835 the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was created an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and Father Vincent, unanimously elected, received the abbatial blessing from Dr. Abraham, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, this being the first abbatial blessing in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Abbot Vincent vigorously undertook the work of completing the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, but died 9 Dec., 1845. Under the short rule of his successor, Dom M. Joseph Ryan, but little was accomplished, as he resigned after only two years. To Don Bruno Fitzpatrick, who succeeded as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> in September, 1848, it remained to consolidate and perfect the work so well begun. He also founded, in 1849, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of New Melleray, near <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> and, in 1878, Mount Saint Joseph, Roscrea, Co. Tipperary, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. But the most conspicuous of Abbot Bruno's works was the founding of the Ecclesiastical Seminary of Mount Melleray. Originating in a small <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> formed by Abbot Vincent in 1843, it was developed by Abbot Bruno and his successors, until it attained its present rank. Abbot Bruno died 4 Dec., 1893, and was succeeded by Dom Carthage Delaney, who was blessed 15 Jan., 1894, and presided over Mount Melleray for thirteen years; his successor, Dom Maurus Phelan, solemnly blessed by Dr. Sheahan, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Waterford, 15 Aug., 1908, is the present <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. The community numbers thirty-eight choir religious (of whom twenty-nine are priests) and twenty-nine <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>.
<h2>New Melleray</h2>

<p>Mount Melleray having become crowded, it was decided to attempt a new foundation. While plans were being discussed, Bishop Lorans, of <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, visited the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> (1849). He expressed a strong desire to have a colony of <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and offered a tract of land about twelve miles from <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>. Abbot Bruno immediately sent two of his religious to inspect the land, and receiving a favourable report, he accepted the offer. Later in the same year he laid the foundation of New Melleray Abbey, appointing, as its first superior, Father James O'Gorman (later <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11249b.htm">Omaha</a>, Nebraska). Father Clement Smyth, the third superior, was also elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, being placed in charge of the <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Diocese of Dubuque</a>. In 1859 the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was made an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and Father Ephraim McDonald elected its first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. The second <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, still in office, is Dom Alberic Dunlea, whose community now numbers thirty-six members.
