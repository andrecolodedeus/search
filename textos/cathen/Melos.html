<h1>Melos</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a>, suffragan of Naxos in the Cyclades. The name seems to have been derived from a Ph&oelig;nician navigator, <em>Melos</em>, though others ascribe it to its rounded or apple shape, <em>Melos</em>. The island has had different names: Zephyria, Memblis, Mimallis, Siphis, Acyton, Byblis, etc. The Ph&oelig;nicians seem to bave been the first to colonize the island; then came the Dorians from Laconia in the twelfth century <font size=-2>B.C.</font> This Dorian colony lasted for seven hundred years, when the Athenians, jealous of their fidelity to the Spartans, took possession of the island in 416 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> All the men were massacred and replaced by five hundred Athenian colonists; the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children were carried captive to Attica. Later on, when these children were grown, they returned to occupy the island. Melos then passed under the domination of the Macedonians, then under that of the Romans, and finally under that of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>, who retained possession of it until 1207, when Marco Sanudo annexed it to the Italian Duchy of Naxos. In 1537 it was taken by the corsair Barbarossa and joined to the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Ottoman Empire</a>. The island continued to prosper, serving as a market and even as a refuge to the corsairs of the West, especially the French; it was so until the eighteenth century, when it began to decline because of a volcano which arose in the vicinity. From 20,000 inhabitants the population decreased to about 2000; united to Greece in 1827 the island now contains 5000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The chief town, called Plaka, possesses a very fine harbour; nearby are the ruins of ancient Melos, with a cemetery, two citadels, a <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Dionysius, a <a href="../cathen/03504a.htm">necropolis</a>, and a theatre. Near the theatre was found in 1820 the celebrated Venus of Melos, now at the Museum of the Louvre at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, the work of a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> of Antioch on the Meander, in the second century <font size=-2>B.C.</font> The earliest known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Melos, Eutychius, assisted at the Sixth &OElig;cumenical Council in 681. <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> (Oriens Christianus, I, 945) mentions a number of Greek titulars, especially at the beginning of the sixteenth century, after the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>. The Greek <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/13024b.htm">Rhodes</a>. A very long list of the Latin residential or <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is found in <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, op. cit., III, 1055-58, and in Eubel, "Hierarchia Catholica medii &aelig;vi", <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, I, 355; II, 211. Melos had <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> until 1700, in which year John Anthony de Camillis died. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was then joined to that of Naxos until 1830, when the island was made a part of the Diocese of Santorin. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Santorin now <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> to the few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who live there.
