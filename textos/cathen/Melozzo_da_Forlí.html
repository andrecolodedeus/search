<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Melozzo da Forl&iacute;</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of the Umbrian School, b. at Forl&igrave;, 1438; d. there 1494. <a href="../cathen/08793c.htm">Lanzi's</a> suggestion that Melozzo studied under Ansuino da Forl&igrave; appears to rest on no foundation. Little is known of this Ansuino, save the slight part he took in the frescoes of the Eremitani Chapel at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, which were finished prior to 1460. He would thus have brought to his pupil the teachings of <a href="../cathen/09610a.htm">Mantegna</a>, but it is more probable that Melozzo fell under no influence other than that of Piero della Francesca. Piero was always engaged engrossed with perspective, and has even left us a treatise on it; therefore it is to him that Melozzo owes his mastery of the subject, as well as his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for large tableaux and the heroic character of his work. Melozzo was one of the artists summoned to the Court of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a> by the magnificent Signor Federigo da Montefeltro, to whom perhaps he was introduced by Giovanni Santi, the father of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>. None of the work he did there has reached us. However, the Barberini Palace (Rome) contains a part of the <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a> series, and among them a few pictures that adorned the duke's study and which, like the incrustations, date from 1476. The "Federigo in armour, with his Son Guidobaldo" is attributed to Melozzo. A charming bust "Guidobaldo, when a child", in the Colonna Palace, is attributed by some to Giovanni Santi, but Berenson thinks it a Melozzo. The famous allegories of the "Arts" and "Sciences" (two <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> in <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> and two in London) and the busts of the "Philosophers" (in the Louvre and in the Barberini), formerly in Federigo's palace, are probably not by Melozzo but by the Fleming, Justus of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>. It was doubtless through Federigo that the artist was recommended to <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>. The importance of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> part in the history of art is well known, for he was the first of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, the herald of <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> and <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, and the founder of the Sixtine Chapel and the Vatican Library. Melozzo became more or less his official <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>. With him he opened the Academy of St. Luke.

<p>The Sixtine <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was already decorated when Melozzo arrived, but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> associated him with two other great undertakings. In 1477 he ordered him to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> a picture commemorating the inauguration of the Vatican. This fresco, now in the Pinacoteca of the Vatican, shows the jurisconsult Platina kneeling before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and receiving from him the keys of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. Grouped around are the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> four nephews, among whom are the prothonotary, Giulio Riario, in a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk's</a> robe, and Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, the future <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>. The scene is set in a hall of marvellous <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> style. The beauty of the architecture, the splendour of the decoration, the vigour of the portraits, the calm and dignity of the composition, and the importance of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> it deals with, make this magnificent work an incomparable page of history. Art has no creation of more unconstrained majesty, so realistically and nobly alive. It is a perfect picture of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> of those days, a vision of the court life of the pontiff, who was the first to make <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the capital of the arts, and the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the world, to crown it with the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and the masterpieces of art and to invent nepotism. <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> also commanded Melozzo to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> an "Ascension" for the choir of the church of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. It was a remarkable <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> speaks admiringly of it, but unfortunately it was destroyed in 1711 when <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">Clement IX</a> enlarged the choir. He was unwilling, however, that such a work of art should be completely lost, so a few detached figures from the group were saved, of which that of "Christ Triumphant" may be seen on the Quirinal staircase. It is one of the earliest known examples of perspective applied to the human figure on roof or ceiling decoration; that is to say, a figure viewed from below. This foreshortened method, a great novelty at that time, has been surpassed a hundredfold, and by third-rate <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, since the day of Correggio.

<p>Melozzo's chief merit is that he created a type of supple and nobly sensuous juvenile beauty, and gave expression to it with inspired ease and lyric swing. This quality stands out more prominently in other fragments of the same fresco, preserved in the larger <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> at St. Peter's, especially in the choral <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, whose faces are irresistible. No artist of that period, and very few since, would have been able to conceive these poetical and vigorous forms, in which womanly charm blends with virile strength, which are so full of health, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of life, movement, and passion. This wonderful work was executed in 1482. A less important one (1478), of "Christ as Judge of the World", can be seen in the Minerva. This power of giving pleasing expression to a life full of richness and harmony, this incomparable gift of plasticity, claims for Melozzo a place apart. Not so great and, especially, not so profound as <a href="../cathen/09610a.htm">Mantegna</a> or <a href="../cathen/13787a.htm">Signorelli</a>, he has nevertheless a truly Italian charm all his own, in which the other two masters are lacking. This charm he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to utilize even in depicting the everyday occurrences of life. To illustrate this, <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> cites in the fresco work of the church of the Apostles a frieze of vine-gatherers which resembles the genre <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of <a href="../cathen/06688b.htm">Benozzo Gozzoli</a> (see his fresco in the Campo Santo at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>), but which is treated with quite a new power and with all the grace and technique of a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of genius. This frieze has been lost, but we can imagine what it was like from a little picture in the College of Forl&igrave; which shows a druggist's apprentice ("Pesta, Pepe") pounding sugar in a mortar. Never was the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of living expressed in so bewitching a manner. The <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> in the Treasury Chapel at Loretto were merely outlined and begun by Melozzo; their execution is almost entirely the work of his pupil Palmezzano.
