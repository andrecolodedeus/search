<h1>Memberton</h1>  

<p>Principal chief of the <a href="../cathen/10283b.htm">Micmac Indians</a> of Nova Scotia at the time of the establishment of the French colony under de Monts and Poutrincourt in 1605, and noted in mission annals of the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> in the tribe. The French form Memberton is a dialectic corruption of the <a href="../cathen/10283b.htm">Micmac</a> name Maopeltu, which is itself a contracted form of Maoi-Napeltu, "chief of all, i.e. "principal chief" from <em>maoi</em> (all) and <em>napeltu</em> (chief, or leader). On St. John's Day, 24 June, 1610, he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with twenty others of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a> Father Messire Jesse Fl&egrave;che at Port Royal, now Annapolis, <a href="../cathen/11135a.htm">Nova Scotia</a>, Poutrincourt and his son acting as sponsors for the King and Dauphin of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He was given the name Henry, after Henry IV, he wife was named Marie after the queen regent, while his children and other relatives were called after members of the royal family. Then very old, although vigorous mentally and physically, he claimed to remember the first visit of Cartier to the <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> in 1534. For many years the acknowledged chief and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> captain, medicine man and chief of tribal ceremonies, in the midst of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> he led a temperate and moral life, even before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, limiting himself to one wife, where <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a> was the rule among great men, one chief having as many as eight. On account of their good offices in the serious illness of his son, he became strongly attached to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries <a href="../cathen/02541d.htm">Biard</a> and Mass&eacute;, who arrived in June, 1611, and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> an earnest, practical <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> frequently expressing a fervent hope for the conversion of his whole tribe. Towards the end of August, 1611, seized with his last illness, he was brought at his own request to <a href="../cathen/02541d.htm">Father Biard's</a> house, where he died a week later having received every attention, and having given consent to be buried in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> cemetery as an example to his people, whom he repeatedly exhorted to maintain a friendship with the French, he was buried with full <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, as befitted his rank and character. <a href="../cathen/02541d.htm">Father Biard</a> says of him: "This was the greatest. most renown, and most formidable savage within the memory of man; of slender physique, taller and longer-limbed than is usual among them; <a href="../cathen/02362a.htm">bearded</a> like a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a> although scarcely any of the others have hair upon their chin; grave and reserved; feeling a proper sense of dignity for his position as commander, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> impressed upon his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a greater <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> that he had been able to form from hearing about it, and he often said to me in his savage tongue, 'Learn our language quickly, for as soon as thou knowest it and has taught me well I wish to become a preacher like thee.' Even before his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> he never cared to have more than one living wife." In accordance with a universal Indian dislike to name the dead, his people referred to him after his death simply as the "Great Chief". At the <a href="../cathen/10283b.htm">Micmac</a> mission town of Sainte-Anne de Ristigouche, Quebec, a monument was unveiled on the third centenary of his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to commemorate the beginnings of the <a href="../cathen/10283b.htm">Micmac</a> mission.
