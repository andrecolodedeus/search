<h1>Mendicant Friars</h1>  

<p>Mendicant Friars are members of those <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders which, originally, by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty renounced all proprietorship not only individually but also (and in this differing from the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>) in common, relying for support on their own work and on the charity of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Hence the name of begging <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>.

<p>There remain from the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> four great mendicant orders, recognized as such by the <a href="../cathen/09476c.htm">Second Council of Lyons</a>, 1274, Sess. 23 (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XXIV, 96) &#151; the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of Preachers</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Hermits of St. Augustine</a>. Successively other congregations obtained the privilege of the mendicants. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXV, cap. iii) granted all the mendicant orders, except the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, the liberty of corporate possession (see <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">FRIAR</a>). The object of the present article is to outline (I) the origin and characteristics of the mendicants; (II) the opposition which they encountered.
<h2 id="section1">Origin</h2>

<p>Historical reasons for the origin of the mendicants are obvious. Since the struggle regarding investitures a certain animosity against <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> had remained. <a href="../cathen/01747b.htm">Arnold of Brescia</a> preached that <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who possessed <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> could not a be saved. A little later John Valdes founded the "Poor Men of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>", soon followed by similar <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. The movement thus started in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> had spread among the poorer classes at the beginning of the thirteenth century and threatened to become dangerous to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. By uniting utter poverty to entire subjection toward, St. Francis became with <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> the bulwark of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> against the new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and the two orders of <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> and Preachers <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> themselves a great help both to the inner and to the external life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Nor was absolute poverty the only characteristic of the new orders. They did not confine themselves to the sanctification of their own members; their maxim was <em>non sibi soli vivere sed et aliis proficere</em> (not to live for themselves only, but to serve others). At once contemplative and active, to the complete renunciation of all things they joined the exercise of the apostolic ministry, devoting themselves to the evangelization of the masses, and thus introducing another element into monastic life. A <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> consequence of their close contact with the people, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the mendicants, unlike those of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> generally, were situated in the towns, in which, at the beginning of the thirteenth century, communal life was rapidly developing. Now as Brewer (Monumenta Franciscana I, p. xvii) observes, and his words may be applied to all the mendicants, "it was to this class of the population, in first instance, that the attention of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> was directed; in these wretched localities (suburbs of the towns) his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and order were seated. A glance at the more important will show the general correctness of this statement. In <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, Warwick, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, <a href="../cathen/02790b.htm">Bristol</a>, Lynn and elsewhere, their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> stood in suburbs and abutted on the city walls". The work of the mendicants in the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, in the confessional, in the service of the sick and the socially weak, in the foreign missions, had no parallel in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.

<p>This same apostolical activity had two consequences, which form further characteristics of the mendicant friars, a new organization of claustral life and, the adoption of a special means of providing subsistence. The mendicants, unlike the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, were not bound by a <em>votum stabilatis</em> (<a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of permanency) to one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> but enjoyed considerable liberty. Not only might they be called upon to exercise their ministry within the limits of a province, but, with permission of the general, they could be sent all over the world. The form of government itself was rather democratic, as for the most part the superiors were not elected for life and were subject to the General Chapter. From their apostolical ministry the mendicants derived the right of support from all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people: <em>dignus est operarius mercede sua</em>. (The labourer is worthy of his hire.) It was only just that having left everything in the world in obedience to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> counsel (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs21">Matthew 19:21</a>; <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs24">16:24</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs1">Luke 9:1-6</a>) in order to devote themselves to the well-being of the people, they should look to the people for their support. And in fact those <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> were regarded as the due of their apostolic work. When later the Apostolici tried to live in the same way as the mendicants, without doing their work, <a href="../cathen/13400a.htm">Salimbene</a> rebuked them indignantly: "They wish to live", he writes, "on the charity of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people, although they do nothing for it, they hear no confessions, they do not preach, nor do they give edification, as do the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> and the Preachers" (Mon. Ger. Hist. Script. XXXII, 255-57, 259, 264). But provision for the necessities of life was not left to chance. Each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> had its limit or district (<em>limes, terminus</em>), in which brothers, generally two and two, made regular visits to solicit <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. This institution still exists in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries, as in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and some parts of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and in the Tyrol, while in others, even <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries, it is forbidden by law, as in some parts of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Opposition</h2>



<p>This new form of conventual life was not introduced without strong opposition. With what feelings the older orders occasionally regarded the rapid spread of the mendicants may be gathered from the it Chronica majora, ad an. 1243", ed. Luard, IV London., 1877, 279, 80; "ad. an. 1246", ibid. 1511-17. Still it is well known that St. Francis was indebted to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> for the "Portiuncula", the first church of his order. The chief opposition came from elsewhere; from the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> and from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. The mendicants did not confine themselves to the sacred ministry, but had almost from the beginning learned members who claimed equality with other <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> were the first <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order to introduce the higher studies as a special point in their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> and if they probably owe their mendicancy to the influence of St. Francis over St. Dominic, the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> are probably indebted for their higher studies to the influence or at least to the example of the Preachers. On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> appreciated the work of the new orders and exempted them from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, granting them extensive faculties for preaching and hearing, confessions, together with the right of burial in their own churches, <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> reserved hitherto to the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. It should be stated here that this opposition, was not inspired merely by <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> or other mean motives, but rather from economical reasons. For the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> depended in great part for their income on the offerings of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, which threatened to diminish through the great popularity enjoyed by the mendicants. On the whole it might be said that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> protected the regulars against <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> attacks, while on the other hand she found means to redress abuses, tending to endanger the legitimate interests of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. The opposition to the mendicants was particularly strong at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> generally, less violent at the <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">University of Oxford</a> and in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Isolated cases are to be found also in other countries. As early as 1231-32 <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> had to protect the mendicants against the pretensions, of some <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, who wanted the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> to be subject to their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> like the ordinary faithful. See different forms of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Nimis iniqua" (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Franc. I, 74-77) repeated by <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, 1245 (op. cit. 368). Although this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> speaks in a general way and is addressed to different countries the abuses enumerated by it were probably of local character.

<p>The first great storm broke out at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> had opened their <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (1229-30) and erected two chairs of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>; the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> followed them (1231). At first (1252) the opposition was directed against the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> wishing to grant them only one professorship [<a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, <a href="../cathen/03637a.htm">"Chartularium"</a> (see. below) I, 26]. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> sought allies and so drew the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> into the struggle (<a href="../cathen/03637a.htm">Chartularium</a> I, 252), with the result that <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, at first favourable to the mendicants (<a href="../cathen/03637a.htm">Chartularium</a> 1, 247), took. away their privileges with regard to preaching, confession, and burial <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Etsi animonim" 21 Nov., 1254 (<a href="../cathen/03637a.htm">Chartularium</a> 1, 1267). This sudden change of attitude towards the mendicants in <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> has not yet been sufficiently explained. The first step of <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> was to suspend the dispositions of his predecessor, <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Nee insolitium", 22 Dec., 1254 (<a href="../cathen/03637a.htm">Chartularium</a> I, 1276), in which he promised new dispositions and forbade meanwhile to act against the mendicants. In these critical circumstances it was doubly unfortunate that Gerard di Borgo S. Donnino should publish his book "Introductorius in Evangelium Esternum" (1254), which besides many other Joachimite <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, attributed to the mendicants a special vocation, to take the place of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> in the near future (1260). The answer was not long delayed. <a href="../cathen/15637d.htm">William of St. Amour</a>, the leader of the opposition against the mendicants, publicly attacked the treatise in his sermon "Qui amat (ed. Brown, "Fasciculus rerum expetendarum" . . London, 1690, II, 51; Guil. a S. Amore, "Opera omnia," Constance 1632, 491). It has been made evident of late that the professors extracted from Gerard's treatise and from Joachim's "Concordia" the thirty-one propositions, partly falsifying them (Matt. Parisiensis first ed., London, 1882, 335-39; "Chartularium 1; 1, 272), and denouncing them with the book to <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>. William went farther and wrote his famous treatise against the mendicants, "De periculis novissimorum temporum" ("Opera om.", op. cit., 17-72; Brown, op cit 11, 18-41, here under a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> title). The author starts from <a href="../bible/2ti003.htm">2 Timothy 3 sqq.</a>, and sees the fulfillment of those words in the rise of the mendicant friars, who however are not specified, though everybody <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the significance. The whole list of vices enumerated by the apostle is applied to the mendicants, whom William blames on all the points which formed their characteristic note. The danger, he goes on, is at our doors, and it is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to avert it. In order that those impostors and pseudo-preachers, may be the more easily detected, William draws up forty-one signs, by which they are to be recognized. This treatise made an enormous impression.

<p><a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a>, however, in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Quasi lignum vitae", 14 April 1255 ("'Bull. Franc." II; "Bull. Traed." I, 276; "Chartularium" I, 279), settled the questions at issue between the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and the mendicants, independently of the case of Gerard di Borgo S. Donnino. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> annulled the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> against the mendicants, who were authorized to continue their public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, even with the two chairs of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, as a part of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. On the other hand, the Master General of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> wrote from <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, May, 1255, to his brethren to be careful and not to provoke the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> against the order (<a href="../cathen/03637a.htm">"Chartularium"</a> I, 289; Reichert, "Monumenta Ord. Frat. Praedicatorum", V, Rome, 1900, 21). At the same time the common interests of the Preachers and <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> inspired the beautiful letter of <a href="../cathen/08475c.htm">John of Parma</a> and <a href="../cathen/07542a.htm">Humbert of Romans</a>, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, May, 1255 (Reichert, op. cit., V, 25; <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a>, "Annals Ord. Min.", III, 380). The professors and students of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> nevertheless did not accept the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Quasi lignum vitae": they wrote 2 Oct., 1255 a sharp protest against it (<a href="../cathen/03637a.htm">Chartularium</a> I, 292). <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a>, 23 Oct., 1255, condemned the "Introductorius in Evangelium aeternum" (<a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, "Archiv. f. Litt. u Knichengesch.", I, 87 sqq.). Moreover 5 Out. 1256, he condemned the treatise "De Periculis novissimorum temporum" in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Romanus Pontifex" (Chartarium I, 1531). Reluctantly the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> submitted to the orders of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. William alone resisted and having been banished from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he wrote another attack against mendicants, "Liber de antichristo et eiusdem miristris" (ed. under a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> name by Martene-Durand, "Vet. Scriptor. amplissima collectio", IX, Paris, 1733, 1271). This redoubtable attack against the mendicants, conducted by the most famous <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, was met by the ablest writers from among the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> wrote "Contra impugnantes Dei cultum"; <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, "Quiestio disputata de paupertate" (Opera omnia, ed. Quaraccehi, V, 125), "Apologia paupernum" a (VII, 233), "De tribus quaestionibus" (VIII, 331). Directly against William's "De periculis" another <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Bertrand of <a href="../cathen/02360b.htm">Bayonne</a>, or perhaps Thomas of York, wrote the treatise, "Manus contra omnipotentem" (<a href="../cathen/03637a.htm">Chartularium</a> I, 415). John of Peckham, later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, took part in the controversy with his "De perfectione evangelica", partly ed. by Little in to Fratris Johannis Pecham. . . . tractatus tres do paupertate" (British Society of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Studies, II, Aberl 1910). The seculars continued the fight, even with popular compositions, of which the best known is the "Roman de la Rose". At the second Council of Lyons new attempts were made against the mendicants, partly because of the rise of other mendicant bodies, some of which were of objectionable form, as the "Apostolici" and the "Friars of the Sack" (Saccati) (see <a href="../cathen/13400a.htm">Salimbene</a>, "Mon. Germ. Hist. Script.", XXXII, 245 sqq) All mendicants were abolished, but the four great orders were excepted on account of the manifest good they wrought. <a href="../cathen/09724a.htm">Martin IV</a>, "Ad fructus uberes", 13 Dec., 1281, and 10 Jan., 1282 (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Franc., 111, 480) extended the privilege of the mendicants with regard to preaching and hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>, a measure which caused much opposition among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, especially in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Only in late years have we come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of the existence of a great transaction on this subject, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> 1290, where Cardinal Gaetano, later on <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, skillfully defended the regulars (See Bibliography). <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> revised the legislation regarding the privileges of the mendicants in favour of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. His <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Super Cathedram", 18 Feb. 1300 (c. 2 in "Clem." III, 7; "Extravag. Com." cap. 2, III, 6; "Bull Franc.", IV, 498) is in substance even now in force.

<p>The controversies between the mendicants and the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> took an acrimonious form in the fourteenth century. We have a peculiarly interesting instance of this in the case of Richard Fitzralph, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, who preached seven or eight times in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> against the mendicants and in nine propositions attacked their poverty and their privileges interfering with <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Denounced at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, he was cited by <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> and defended himself in a treatise, which he read in a public consistory, 8 Nov., 1357, printed under the title "Defensorium Curatorum" in Goldast, "Monarchia S. Romani Imperii. . .", II, Frankfort, 1614, 1391-1410 and in Brown, "Fasciculus rerum", II, 466-487., There is a compendium of the nine propositions in Old English in Howlett, "Monumenta Franciscana" II, 276-77. This curious document might be called a negative exposition of the rule of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>. An English <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Richard Conway, defended the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> against Fitzralph; his treatise is edited by Goldast, op. cit., 11, 1410-44. <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> gave a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, 1 Oct., 1358, in which he stated that a commission had been named to examine the differences between the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a> and the mendicants and forbade meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to hinder the four mendicant orders from exercising their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Franc., VI, 316). In the following year a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> prescribing the observance of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> "Super Cathedram" of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> was directed to different <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the continent and to the Arch. <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of York, 26 Nov., 1359 (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Franc., VI, 322). Towards the end of the fourteenth century the mendicants in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> were attacked more fiercely and on a broader scale by the Wicliffites. <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wiclif</a> himself at first, was not on bad terms with the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>; his enmity was confined to the last few years of his life. While <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wiclif</a> had only repeated the worn-out arguments against the mendicants, his disciples went much farther and accused them of the lowest vices. Nor did they confine their <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> to learned treatises, but embodied them in popular poems and songs, mostly English, of which we have many examples in the two volumes published by Wright (see bibliography). The chief place of controversy was Oxford, where the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> were accused even of sedition. On 18 Feb., 1382, the heads of the four mendicant orders wrote a joint letter to John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, protesting against the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> of the Wicliffites and stating that their chief enemy was Nicholas Hereford, Professor of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, who in a sermon announced that no religious should be admitted to any degree at Oxford. This letter is inserted in <a href="../cathen/10764a.htm">Thomas Netter's</a> "Fasciduli Zizaniorum, magistri Job. Wyclif" (ed. Waddington, Rer. Brit. Script., London, 1858, 292-95). There are in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries many other instances of hostility with which the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, especially the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a>, were regarded by the <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">University of Oxford</a>. Though the Black Death and the Great Schism had <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> effects on their general discipline, the mendicants, thanks to the rise of numerous branches of stricter observance, on the whole flourished until the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Notwithstanding the heavy losses sustained during that period, the mendicants have nevertheless continued to take their part, and that a considerable one, in the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> down to the present day.
