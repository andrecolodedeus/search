<h1>Mennas</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople from 536 to 552. Early in 536 Pope St. Agapetus came to Constantinople on a political mission forced on him by the Gothic king, Theodahad. Anthimus, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15028a.htm">Trebizond</a>, had just been transferred to Constantinople through the influence of the Empress Theodora, with whose <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> leanings he was in sympathy. Agapetus promptly <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> Anthimus and he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Mennas patriarch. Anthimus was deposed partly because his transfer from one see to another was uncanonical, and partly on account of his <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. The question next arose whether he should be allowed to return to his old see. Agapetus was preparing to deal with this question when he died. Mennas proceeded with the affair at a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in Constantinople the same year, 536, presiding over it the place of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> on his right hand being assigned to five <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who represented the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. The result was that Anthimus, who failed to appear and vindicate his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> together with several of his adherents. In 543 the <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Emperor Justinian</a> acting with the approval, if not under the prompting of Mennas and the Roman representative, Pelagius, issued his celebrated edict against the teaching of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, at the same time directing Mennas to hold a local council to consider the matter. No record of this synod had been preserved, but <a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a> demonstrates it to be more than probable that the celebrated Fifteen Anathematisms of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, mistakenly ascribed to the Fifth Ecumenical Council, were there <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. We now come to the part played by Mennas the initial stage of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> controversy (see COUNCILS OF CONSTANTINOPLE). The first from whom the emperor Justinian demanded subscription to the edict <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizing</a> the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> was Mennas. He hesitated, but eventually gave way on the understanding that his subscription should be returned to him if the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> disapproved. Later on he compelled his suffragans to subscribe. Many of them complained to the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> Stephen of the constraint put upon them. Stephen broke off communion with Mennas. When <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a> arrived at Constantinople in 547, he cut Mennas off from <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">Church communion</a> for four months. Mennas retorted by striking the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> name off the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>. When Vigilius issued his "Judicatum", the two were reconciled. In 551 Mennas was again <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. When Vigilius and Justinian came to terms, Mennas once more made his peace with the former, asking pardon for having communicated with those whom the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. He died in August, 552.
