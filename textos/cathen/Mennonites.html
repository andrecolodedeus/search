<h1>Mennonites</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> denomination of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and America which arose in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> in the sixteenth century and derived its name from Menno Simons, its leader in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. Menno Simons was born in 1492 at Witmarsum in Friesland. In 1515 or 1516 he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and appointed assistant at Pingjum not far from Witmarsum. Later (1532) he was named <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of his native place, but 12 January, 1536, resigned his charge and became an <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptist</a> elder. The rest of his life was devoted to the interests of the new <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> which he had joined. Though not an imposing <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> he exercised no small influence as a speaker and more particularly as a writer among the more moderate holders of <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptist</a> views. His death occurred 13 January, 1559, at Wustenfelde in Holstein. The opinions held by Menno Simons and the Mennonites originated in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. In 1525 Grebel and Manz founded an <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptist</a> community at <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>. Persecution followed upon the very foundation of the new <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, and was exercised against its members until 1710 in various parts of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. It was powerless to effect suppression and a few communities exist even at present. About 1620 the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Mennonites split into Amish or Upland Mennonites and Lowland Mennonites. The former differ from the latter in the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> dissolves marriage, in their rejection of buttons and of the practice of shaving. During Menno's lifetime his followers in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> divided (1554) into "Flemings" and "Waterlanders", on account of their divergent views on <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. The former subsequently split up into different parties and dwindled into insignificance, not more than three congregations remaining at present in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. Division also weakened the "Waterlanders" until in 1811 they united, dropped the name of Mennonites and called themselves "Doopsgezinde" (Baptist persuasion), their present official designation in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. Menno founded congregations exclusively in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and Northwestern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Mennonite communities existed at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, however in South <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> where they were historically connected with the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> movement, and are found at present in other parts of the empire, chiefly in eastern <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. The offer of extensive land and the assurance of religious liberty <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> a few thousand German Mennonites to <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrate</a> to Southern <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> (1788). This emigration movement continued until 1824, and resulted in the foundation of comparatively important Mennonite colonies. In America the first congregation was founded in 1683 at Germantown, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. Subsequently immigration from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and since 1870 from <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, considerably increased the number of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> in North America. There are twelve different branches in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in some of which the membership does not reach 1000. Among the peculiar views of the Mennonites are the following: repudiation of infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a>, law-suits, civil office-holding and the bearing of arms. Baptism of adults and the Lord's Supper, in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">really present</a>, are retained, but not as <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> properly so-called. Non-resistance to <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> is an important tenet and an extensive use is made of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. All these views, however, are no longer universally held, some Mennonites now accepting secular offices. The polity is congregational, with <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, elders, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. The aggregate membership of the Mennonites is now usually given as about 250,000; of these there are some 60,000 in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>; 18,000 in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; 70,000 in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; 1500 in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>; 20,000 in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and according to Dr. Carroll (Christian Advocate, New York, 27 January, 1910), 55,007 in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.
