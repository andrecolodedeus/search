<h1>Mensa, Mensal Revenue</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, <em>Mensa,</em> table).

<p>The Latin word <em>mensa</em> has for its primitive signification "a table for meals"; it designates by extension the expenses, or better, the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> resources of sustenance, and generally, all the resources for personal support. He who lives at the expense of another, and at his table, is his "commensal". In <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> language, the mensa is that portion of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of a church which is appropriated to defraying the expenses either of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> or of the community which serves the church, and is administered at the will of the one or the other. Thus, in a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, to which both the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the chapter belong, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> mensa is distinct from that of the chapter, the former consisting of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> the revenues of which are enjoyed by the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, the latter by the chapter. The capitular mensa consists chiefly of individual <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, for the primitive mensa of the chapter has almost everywhere been divided among the canons, each of whom has his personal share under the designation of a "prebend". Similarly, in the case of <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> given <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em> (cf. c. Edoceri, 21, De rescriptis), the abbatial mensa, which the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> enjoys, is distinct from the conventual mensa, which is applied to the maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community. The curial mensa, which is of later origin, is of the same nature: the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> reserved for the personal maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, as distinct from that applied to the expenses of worship or to the support of other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, has been regarded as curial mensa. To constitute a mensa in the canonical sense, therefore, it is not enough that a certain portion of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> be appropriated to the maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (for in that case every <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> would be a mensa, which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>); it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that there be a partition made in the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of one particular church so as to appropriate certain <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to the maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> or <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, or of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> subject to him; it follows, therefore, that the administration of this <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> belongs to those who enjoy it.

<p>Thus the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the secular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, the chapter, the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community, administer, each within appropriate limits, the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of their respective mens&aelig;, without being liable to any accounting for the employment of its revenues; this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who has a curial mensa. The other resources of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> or <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, destined for religious worship, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> works, the maintenance of buildings, etc., are subject to the general or special rules for the administration of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, whether this be done by church committees, trustees, or other administrative organ, or by the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the church as sole administrator; in all cases an accounting is due to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and, in general, to the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>, for the administration of such <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. There are, however, some exceptions to this principle. Since mens&aelig;, particularly episcopal mens&aelig;, are legal entities, <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and foundations have in the course of centuries often been annexed to them for purposes other than the maintenance of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>; these properties or foundations may be real "opera pia" or <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> works in the canonical sense. In this way some episcopal mens&aelig; control <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and houses for the benefit of aged or infirm <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, also for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and other establishments; to some curial mens&aelig; <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> or <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> are attached, and for these various <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> administrative rules may be provided at the time of their foundation. But such cases it is easily seen are later extensions, foreign to the primary and chief aim of the mens&aelig;. Even in respect to these properties the old rule applies, in the sense that they are not common <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> possessions and are not administered as such, but after the manner of mensal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>.

<p>Although appropriated to the maintenance of certain defininte <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, mensal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> is nevertheless <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, and its administrator is bound to observe the canonical rules concerning it. As to the administration strictly speaking, he must keep the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in good condition and execute all works expedient to that end; in short, he must act like a good head of a household. But he cannot do anything that would infringe upon proprietary <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, for he is not the proprietor: any alienation, or any contract which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> regards as similar to alienation, is forbidden him, excepting under prescribed juridical formalities, under pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> (Extrav. Ambitios&aelig;, "De reb. eccl. non alienandis"; see also <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">B<font size=-2>ENEFICE</font></a>; <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">P<font size=-2>ROPERTY,</font> A<font size=-2>LIENATION OF</font> C<font size=-2>HURCH</font></a>). The chief of these prescribed formalities is the Apostolic authorization, given either directly or by Indult, and that only when the alienation or similar contract is to the advantage of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For the alienation of mensal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, or for making any similar contract, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is, in particular, bound to safeguard himself with the consent of the chapter (S. C. Concilii, 25 July, 1891).
<h2>History</h2>

<p>Like all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions, the mensa has reached its present juridical status as the result of various modifications. In the first ages, all the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> formed but one mass connected, like everything else, with the principal, or <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>. The administration of it belonged to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> alone, who administered it himself or through his <em>&aelig;conomus</em> or his <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> received a portion of the revenues of this <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, sometimes fixed (one-fourth in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, one-third in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; see the collected texts, c. 23-30, C., XII, q. ii; c. 1-3, C., X, q. iii), sometimes left to the equitable decision of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Soon the churches outside of the episcopal city had distinct administrations of their own, and the wealth appropriated to religious worship or to the support of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was regarded as their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. After the fifth century we find <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> granting to certain <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, by way of "pr&aelig;carium", i.e. <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> revocable at will, which such <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> used for their own support. So long as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the church remained faithfully in residence and discharged his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions, there was no reason for surrendering to the inferior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, a part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> wealth that they might thence draw their support. But when the early Carlovingians, especially <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a>, habitually gave <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and churches to their companions in arms, and when <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> nominated by royal favour ceased to reside habitually at their sees, there arose a kind of division and opposition between the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the community of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, who were on more than one occasion left in want by <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greedy</a> or negligent superiors. The remedy for this was the institution of mens&aelig;.

<p>To secure what was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the community, the beneficiary was compelled to reserve for its use a sufficient portion of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the church or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Thus the superior's administration was made lighter for him, while he could enjoy in peace and quiet the balance of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> reserved for his own proper use (<em>indominicatum</em>); on the other hand the community gained, besides material security, a renovation of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, since material privation was inevitably a cause of relaxation of discipline. The <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> reforms, notably those of Louis the Pious, were chiefly responsible for the establishment of mens&aelig; properly imposed and regulated in regard to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; as to <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> the mensa was more commonly a benevolent concession on the part of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who in this way fostered community life (<em>vita canonica</em>) among his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. This community life becoming more and more rare after the end of the ninth century, each canon received his own share of the mensal revenues&mdash;his "prebend". Later on, indeed, the canons often had the separate administration of their respective properties, either as the result of partition or, more particularly, in pursuance of provisions made in the foundation. The mens&aelig;, of whatever character, were legally capable of acquiring additions. It was through them that <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, intended, as before the division, not only for the support of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but for all religious and charitable works, was re-established.
