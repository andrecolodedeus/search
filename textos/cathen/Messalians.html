<h1>Messalians</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Praying</a> folk; participle <em>Pa'el</em> of the Aramaic word meaning "to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>").

<p>An <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> which originated in Mesopotamia about 360 and survived in the East until the ninth century. They are also called Euchites from the Greek translation of their Oriental name (<em>euchetai</em> from <em>euchomai</em>, to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>); Adelphians from their first leader; Lampetians from Lampetius, their first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (<a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> about 458); Enthusiasts from their peculiar tenet of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost by Whom they thought themselves inspired or possessed (<em>enthous</em>). The <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">non-Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the Euphemites were also called Messalians, and Epiphanius (Haer., lxxx), our sole informant about these, considers them the forerunners of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Messalians. The <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">non-Christian</a> Messalians are said to have admitted a plurality of gods, but to have worshipped only one, the Almighty (<em>Pantokrator</em>). They were forcibly suppressed by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> magistrates and many of them <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. Hence they became self-styled <em>Martyriani</em>. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Messalians were a kind of Eastern <a href="../cathen/01223a.htm">Circumcellions</a> or vagrant <a href="../cathen/12608c.htm">Quietists</a>. Sacraments they held to be useless, though harmless, the only spiritual power being <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, by which one drove out the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a> which <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> had not expelled, received the indwelling of the Holy Ghost, and arrived at union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, becoming so perfect that the passions ceased to trouble. They disregarded discipline in the matter of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, wandered from place to place, and in summer were accustomed to sleep in the streets. To avoid <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> they would conform to ecclesiastical usages, profess <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, and deny any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> doctrines ascribed to them. They engaged in no occupations, were solely occupied in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, as they said, or rather in sleep, as Theodoret sarcastically remarks. The intensity of their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> brought them into immediate communication with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a>. When they had reached the passionless state (<em>apatheia</em>, "apathy"), they saw the Trinity, the three Divine Persons becoming one and dwelling within them. They likewise saw the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> that go through the world for the ruin of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and trod them under foot. In fact every man had within him a demon, who could only be replaced by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was full of demons once.

<p>Flavian, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, tried to suppress them in his city about 376. By feigning sympathy he made Adelphius disclose his real doctrines; and then he banished him and his followers. They then wandered to the south-east of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. <a href="../cathen/01438a.htm">Amphilochius of Iconium</a> caused them to be again condemned at the Synod of Side (388 or 390). Letoius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10166a.htm">Melitene</a>, finding some <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> tainted with this <a href="../cathen/12608c.htm">Quietism</a>, burnt them and drove the wolves from the sheepfold, as Theodoret narrates. The "Asceticus", "that filthy book of this heresy", as it is called in the public acts of the Third General Council (431), was condemned at Ephesus, after it had already been condemned by a Council of Constantinople in 426 and by the local council at which Amphilochius of Side presided. Yet the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> continued to exist. At first it included only <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. Lampetius, one of the leaders after the middle of the fifth century was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, having been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Alypius of C&aelig;sarea. He was degraded from his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> on account of unpriestly conduct. He wrote a book called "The Testament". Salmon refers to a fragment of an answer by Severus of Antioch to this work of Lampetius (Wolf, "Anecdota Grfca", III, 182). In <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> in the middle of the fifth century strict decrees were issued against them, and they were especially accused of immorality; so that their very name in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> became the equivalent for "filthy". The <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> did their best to stamp out the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by legislation; the Messalians ceased to exist under that name, but revived under that of the Bogomili. In the West they seem hardly to have been known; when the Marcianists, who held somewhat the same tenets as the Messalians, were mentioned to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a>, he professed never to have heard of the Marcian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.
