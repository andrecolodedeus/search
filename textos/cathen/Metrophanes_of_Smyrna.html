<h1>Metrophanes of Smyrna</h1>  

<p>A leader of the faithful Ignatian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at the time of the Photian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> (867). <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> (Ann. Ecci., ad an. 843, I) says that his mother was the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was bribed to bring a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> accusation of rape against the Patriarch Methodius I (842-846) during the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast troubles</a>. If this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> he was a native of Constantinople. In 857, when Ignatius was deposed, Metrophanes was already <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>. He was strongly opposed to Photius. For a short time he wavered, as Photius promised not to attack Ignatius' <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, but, as soon as he found how little the intruder kept his word, he went back to his former attitude, from which nothing could make him waver again. Metrophanes was the leader of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Photius in 858; they declared themselves <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> if ever they recognized him. This somewhat rash pledge explains his attitude later. He was chained and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, then sent into exile by the Government. After Photius' first fall (867) Metrophanes came back to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. He was present at the eighth general council (Constantinople, IV, 869), opened the sixth session with a speech and was one of the judges who condemned Photius. When Ignatius died in 877 and Photius succeeded lawfully with the consent of <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a>, Metrophanes still refused to recognise him, for which conduct he was again banished. At the Photian Synod of 879 a certain Nicetas appears as <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>; meanwhile Metrophanes lay sick at Constantinople. In 880 as he still refused to have anything to do with Photius he was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>. After that he disappears. It is uncertain whether he returned to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at Photius' second fall or whether he died in exile. A letter of his to a patrician, Manuel, is extant, written in 870, in which he gives his reasons for his opposition to Photius (in <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XIV, 414). Other works attributed to him but strongly Photian in tone ("Against the New Manicheans", i.e., the Latins, and "On the Procession of the Holy Ghost from the Father alone") are certainly spurious. See Fabricius-Harles, Bibliotheca Gr&aelig;ca (Hamburg, 1790-1809), XI, 700.
