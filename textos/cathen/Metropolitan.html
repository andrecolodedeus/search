<h1>Metropolitan</h1>  

<p><em>Metropolitan</em>, in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> language, refers to whatever relates to the metropolis, the principal city, or see, of an <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>; thus we speak of a metropolitan church, a metropolitan chapter, a metropolitan official, etc. The word <em>metropolitan</em>, used without any qualificative, means the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the metropolitan see, now usually styled <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm"><em>archbishop</em></a>. The term metropolite (<em>Metropolites</em>, Metropolita) is also employed, especially in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a> (see <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">ARCHBISHOP</a>). The entire body of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> which canon law attributes to the metropolitan, or <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> as such, i.e., not for his own diocese, but for those suffragan to him and forming his <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>, is called the <em>metropoliticum</em>.

<p>The effective authority of metropolitans over their provinces has gradually diminished in the course of centuries, and they do not now exercise even so much as was accorded them by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>; every <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> being more strongly and more directly bound to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is so much the less bound to his province and its metropolitan. The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the latter over his suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> is in a sense ordinary, being established by law; but it is mediate and restricted to the objects provided for by the canons. Since the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the metropolitan have been reduced to the following:

<ul> <li>He convokes and presides at the provincial council, at which all his suffragans must appear, saving legitimate excuse, and which must be held every three years (Conc. Trid., Sess. XXIV, c. ii, De ref.). The same holds for other provincial meetings of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. <li>He retains, in theory, the right of <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">canonical visitation</a> of his suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, but on two conditions which make the right practically inoperative: he must first finish the visitation of his own diocese, and the visitation must be authorized by the provincial council. In the course of this visitation, the metropolitan, like the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, has the right of "procuration", i.e., he and his retinue must be received and entertained at the expense of the churches visited. Moreover, he can absolve "in foro conscientiae" (ibid., iii). <li>He is charged with special vigilance over his suffragans in the matter of residence; he must denounce to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> those who have been twice absent for six months each time, without due cause or permission (Conc. Trid. Sess., vi, c. i). And similarly for the prescriptions relating to <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> (Sess. XXIII, c. xviii). <li>The metropolitan has no judicial authority over his suffragans, major criminal causes of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> being reserved to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and minor ones to the provincial council (Sess. XXIV, c. v.); but he is still the judge of second instance for causes, civil or criminal, adjudicated in the first instance by the officials of his suffragans and appealed to his tribunal. Hence results a certain inequality for matters adjudicated in the first instance in the archdiocese, and to remedy this various concessions have now been provided. But the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of two officials by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, one <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>, the other metropolitan, with appeal from the one to the other, is not admissible. This practice was used in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> under the old regime, but was not general, and even the Gallicans held it to be at variance with canon law (H&eacute;ricourt, Les Lois eccl&eacute;siastiquesde France", E.V, 13). On this principle the nullity of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> marriage was decided by the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> and the metropolitan officials of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1810 (Schnitzer, "Kathol. Eherecht", Freiburg, 1898, 660). The metropolitan tribunal may also try as at first instance causes not terminated within two years by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> tribunal (Sess. XXIV, c. xx). <li>In regard to <a href="../cathen/04768a.htm">devolution</a>, the metropolitan may nominate the <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a> of a vacant diocese, if the chapter has failed to nominate within eight days (Sess. xxiv, c. xvi). In like manner he has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to fill open <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> (i.e., those of free collation) which his suffragans have left unfilled after six months; also to canonically institute candidates presented by patrons if the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> allows two months to pass without instituting. <li>Lastly, in the matter of honorific <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges the metropolitan has the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> as the ensign of his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; he takes precedence of all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; he may have the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> cross (crux gestatoria) borne before him anywhere within his province, except in the presence of a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>; he may celebrate pontifically (saving such acts as constitute an exercise of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, e.g., <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>), may wear his <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a> and <a href="../cathen/10624b.htm">mozetta</a> uncovered (not hidden under the <a href="../cathen/09611a.htm">mantelletta</a>, like a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of another diocese); may <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> publicly, and may grant an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of 100 days (S.C. Indulg., 8. Aug., 1903). He ensigns his arms with the double <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> cross and the hat with ten tassels on either side. </ul>
