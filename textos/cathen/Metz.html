<h1>Metz</h1>  

<p>A town and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>.
<h2 id="section1">The town of Metz</h2>

<p>In ancient times Metz, then known as Divodurum, was the capital of the Celtic Mediomatrici, and at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era was already occupied by the Romans. As the junction of several military roads, and as a well-fortified town, it soon became of great importance. One of the last strongholds to surrender to the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, it survived the attacks of the Huns, and finally passed, about the end of the fifth century, through peaceful negotiations into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. Theodorick of Austrasia chose it in 511 as his residence; the reign of Queen Brunhild reflected great splendour on the town. Though the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> churches were to be found outside the city, the existence in the fifth century of the oratory of St. Stephen within the city walls has been fully <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. In the beginning of the seventh century the oldest monastic establishments were those of St. Glossinde and St. Peter. Under the Carlovingians the town preserved the good-will of the rulers, whose <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> seat was near by; Charles the Bald was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> in the Basilica, and here Louis the Pious and his son Drogo are buried. In 843 Metz became the capital of the Kingdom of Lorraine, and several diets and councils were held there. Numerous books of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, the product of the Metz <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of writing and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, such as the famous "Trier Ada" <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> and the Sacramentary of Drogo (now at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>), are evidence of the active <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> lives that were led.

<p>In 870 the town became part of the East Frank kingdom, and belonged (911-25) as part of <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The increasing influence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the city became greater when Adalbert I (928-62) obtained a share of the privileges of the counts; until the twelfth century, therefore, the history of the town is practically identical with that of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (see below). In 1039 a splendid edifice was built to take the place of the old <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Stephen.

<p>In the twelfth century began the efforts of the burgesses to free themselves from the domination of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In 1180 the burgesses for the first time formed themselves into a close corporation, and in 1207 the <em>Tredecem jurati</em> were appointed as municipal representatives, but they were still nominated directly by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who had also a controlling influence in the selection of the presiding officer of the board of aldermen, which first appears in the eleventh century. The twenty-five representatives sent by the various <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> held an independent position; in judicial matters they helped the <em>Tredecem jurati</em> and formed the democratic element of the system of government. The other municipal authorities were chosen by the town aristocracy, the so-called Paraiges, 1. e. the five associations whose members were selected from distinguished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> to protect the interests of their relatives. The other body of burgesses, called a Commune, also appears as a Paraige from the year 1297; in the individual offices it was represented by double the number of members that each of the older five Paraiges had. Making common cause, the older <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> unions and the Commune found it advantageous to gradually increase the powers of the city as opposed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and also to keep the control of the municipal government fully in their hands and out of that of the powerful growing guilds, so that until the sixteenth century Metz remained a purely aristocratic organization. In 1300 the Paraiges gained the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to fill the office of head-alderman, during the fourteenth century the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to elect the <em>Tredecem jurati</em>, and in 1383 the right of coining. The guilds, which during the fourteenth century had attained great independence, were completely suppressed (1383), and the last revolutionary attempt of the artisans to seize control of the city government (1405) was put down with much bloodshed.

<p>The city had often to fight for its freedom; from 1324-27 against the Dukes of Luxemburg and Lorraine, as well as against the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>; in 1363 and 1365 against the band of English mercenaries under Arnold of Cervola, in the fifteenth century against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the Dukes of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, who sought to annex Metz to their lands or at least wanted to exercise a protectorate. Nevertheless it maintained its independence, even though at great cost, and remained, outwardly at least, part of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, whose ruler, however, concerned himself very little with this important frontier stronghold. Charles IV in 1354 and 1356 held brilliant diets here, at the latter of which was <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> the famous statute known as the "Golden <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>". The town therefore felt that it occupied an almost independent position between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and wanted most of all to evade the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of imperial taxes and attendance at the diet. The estrangement between it and the German States daily became wider, and finally affairs came to such a pass that in the religious and political troubles of 1552 the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> party in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> betrayed Metz to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. By an agreement of the German princes, Moritz of Saxony, William of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, John Albrecht of Mecklenburg, and George Frederick of Brandenburg, with Henry II of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, ratified by the French king at Chambord (15 January), Metz was formally transferred to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the gates of the city were opened (10 April), and Henry took possession as vicari<em>us sacri imperii et urbis protector</em> (18 April). The <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm#iii">Duke of Guise</a>, commander of the garrison, restored the old fortifications and added new ones, and successfully resisted the attacks of the emperor from October to December, 1552; Metz remained French. The recognition by the empire of the illegal surrender came at the conclusion of the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>. By the construction of the citadel (1555-62) the new government secured itself against the citizens, who were discontented with the turn of events. Important internal changes soon took place. In place of the Paraiges stood the authority of the French king, whose representative was the governor. The head-alderman, now appointed by the governor, was replaced (1640) by a Royalist Mayor. The aldermen were also appointed by the governor and henceforth drawn from the whole body of burgesses; in 1633 the judgeship passed to the Parliament. The powers of the <em>Tredecem jurati</em> were also restricted, in 1634 totally abolished, and replaced by the <em>Bailliage royal</em>.



<p>Among the cities of <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, Metz held a prominent position during the French occupation for two reasons: In the first place it became one of the most important fortresses through the work of Vauban (1674) and Cormontaigne (1730); secondly, it became the capital of the temporal province of the three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, which <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had seized (1552) and, by the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, retained. In 1633 there was created for this "Province des trois &eacute;v&ecirc;ch&eacute;s" (also called "G&eacute;n&eacute;ralit&eacute; des trois &eacute;v&ecirc;ch&eacute;s" or "Intendance de Metz") a supreme court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and court of administration, the Metz Parliament. In 1681 the Chambre Royale, the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> Assembly chamber, whose business it was to decide what fiefs belonged to the three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> which <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> claimed for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, was made a part of this Parliament, which lasted, after a temporary dissolution (1771-75), until the final settlement by the National Assembly in 1789, whereupon the division of the land into departments and districts followed. Metz became the capital of the Department of Moselle, created in 1790. The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolution</a> brought great calamities upon the city. In the campaigns of 1814 and 1815 the allied armies twice besieged the city, but were unable to take it. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 Metz was the headquarters and rendezvous of the third French Army Corps under Bazaine. Through the operations of the German army, Bazaine, after the battles of Colombey, Mars-la-Tour, and Gravelotte (14-18 August) was besieged in Metz. The German army of investment was commanded by Prince Frederick Charles of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>; as the few sorties of the garrison were unable to break the German lines, Metz was forced to surrender (27 October), with the result that 6000 French officers and 170,000 men were taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>. By the Treaty of Frankfort, Metz became once more a German city, and since then has been made a most important garrison and a first-class fortress. The city, after the levelling of the fortifications on the south and east (1898), secured space for growth and development. In 1905 the city had 60,419 inhabitants, of whom 43,082 were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 15,556 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and 1691 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; by 1910 the number of inhabitants, through the absorption of several villages, has increased to 68,100.
<h2 id="section2">The See of Metz</h2>

<p>The first fully authenticated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Sperus or Hesperus, who took part in the Synod of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> (535). The most important of the early <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is the holy Arnulf (611-27), founder of the race of the Carlovingians. His remains were transferred in 643 by his successor Abbo (627-42) to the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John outside the city and henceforth known as St. Arnulf's church. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were usually <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Arnulf. The boundaries of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> stretched originally to the Rhine, but after the <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">See of Strasburg</a> was founded, only to the Vosges mountains; from the top of the northern Vosges mountains the diocese embraced the upper Saar and adjoining districts, and extended to the Moselle and a little beyond Diedenhofen; the southern boundary followed the left tributary of the Moselle, Rupt de Mad, then up the Moselle to the mouth of the Meurthe, and in a slight curve to the upper Meurthe. This district, which is not to be confounded with the temporal province, comprised practically the diocese up to the nineteenth century. Prominent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the eighth century included Chrodegang (742-46), who founded the Abbey of Gorze and gave to his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> a special rule for a canonical life, modelled after the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Benedictine rule</a>, the basis of the <em>vita communis</em> of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Then followed Angilram (768-91), the friend of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charles the Great</a>, who, like his predecessor, received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>. Yet the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> dignity was not transferred to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> itself; Metz was always regarded as being a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. Bishop Drogo (823-55), son of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Emperor Charles</a>, remained loyal to his brother Louis the Pious, and exerted considerable influence. In the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, the suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Amalarius and Lantfried supported him. In the important position Metz assumed after the division of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> dominions into West and East Franconia, the German rulers took care that only men who would be loyal to them were appointed to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. After the unworthy Wigerich or Witger of Lorraine (917-27), Henry I appointed the Swabian Bruno, who, in the second year of his administration, blinded by the inhabitants of Metz, returned to his hermitage. Adalbert (928-62), although at first an opponent of <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a>, received on the death of the Duke of Metz (945) a portion of the privileges of count, a fact which went far to increase the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; in 959, through the division of the Duchy of Lorraine into Upper and Lower Lorraine, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was withdrawn from the ducal authority and placed immediately under the imperial. After the death of Adalbert, Otto's brother, Bruno of Cologne, governed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>; then Dietrich II (964-84), a cousin of Otto; Adalbert II (984-1005); Adalbert III (1006); Dietrich III (1006-47), brother of the Empress Kunigunde; Adalbert IV (1047-72), all closely related to the reigning house. In spite of this, however, the choice of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was generally an excellent one. The first church reform movement of which the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of St. Clement, St. Arnulf, and St. Glossinde were the focus, originated with Adalbert I and Bruno; under Dietrich I the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Symphorus was again restored, and the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Stephen built by Dietrich III in 1039.

<p>This friendly relation received a serious set-back through the investiture controversy, which many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> carried on with the assistance of the emperor's adversaries. The Saxon Herman (1073-90) appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and was in consequence deposed by the emperor, and two other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> appointed in his stead. Until the conclusion of the Concordat of Worms a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> and an imperial <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> were continually opposed to each other. Even Stephen of Bar (1120-63), appointed by <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Calixtus II</a>, only obtained possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> after this Concordat. In an endeavour to free themselves from the episcopal power, the inhabitants of Metz sought to make use of these quarrels between the emperor and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but Stephen once more restored the sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Bishop Bertrand (1179-1212) gave the city the system of government described above. Under his successor Conrad I of Scharfenberg (1212-24) the first settlements of the new orders of Mendicant Friars, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Augustinians, and <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, were made in the diocese. With John of Aspremont (1224-38), the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to be elected solely by <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, and Jacob of Lorraine (1239-60), who once more upheld the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> against the city, the development of the temporal possessions of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> came to a halt. These temporal possessions were obtained through the gifts of the Carlovingians, always friendly to Metz. In 770 it received full <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the Senones Abbey under Drogo, over the Maursm&uuml;nster Abbey, in 923 over Zabern, in 931 over Saarburg, and many others. On the dissolution of the old countships in the tenth century, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, subject only to the imperial government, enlarged its possessions and acquired sovereignty in the old District of Moselle, in the Saar District, and in the Blies District. The most important acquisitions at that time and later were r&eacute;milly (984), Saarbr&uuml;cken (998), the lordship of P&uuml;ttlingen (1135), and l&uuml;tzelburg (1143), the fiefs of the countship of Dagsburg (1225), the lordship of Briey (1225), Rixingen and M&ouml;rsberg (1255). Throughout the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries began the decline of these possessions, principally on account of the quarrels of almost all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; namely, Rainald of Bar (1302-16), Adhemer of Monteil (1327-61), under whom the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was begun, Dietrich IV Bayer of Boppard (1365-84) with the Dukes of Lorraine and the Counts of Bar and Luxemburg. During the thirteenth century sovereignty over the city of Metz and its environs (the <em>pays</em> Messin) was lost; the continual need of money by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter forced them to pledge the title deeds of their domains, fiefs, and taxes to the Dukes of Lorraine, the Counts of Bar, the city of Metz, and even to the burgesses.

<p>Another element was the fact that during the great <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>, for a long time two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had made the diocese a scene of strife, until Rudolf of Coucy received general recognition (1387-1415). His successors Conrad II Bayer of Boppard (1415-59), and George I of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1459-84) were the last German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the old see to once more work for the maintenance of a loyal sentiment in the city and see. With Henry II of Lorraine (1484-1505) began and continued during the next one hundred and twenty years, the long line of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the ducal house of <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a> which had incessantly aimed to increase its domains at the expense of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> and was well supported therein by the kindred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> through the transfer of numerous enfeoffments and mortgages. One benefit, derived through the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, was that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was preserved in their diocese and in this they had the powerful support of their house. In this way, Cardinal John IV of Lorraine (1518-43 and 1548-50), who exercised authority over no less than twelve <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> withstood the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Charles I of <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm">Guise</a>, appointed by the <a href="../cathen/07074a.htm#iv">Cardinal of Lorraine</a>, retained only the temporal administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, and appointed in succession as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for the spiritual government, Cardinal Robert of Lenoncourt (1551-55) who after the reversion of the city of Metz to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> tried to enforce the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> claim to sovereignty over the city and declared himself <em>Prince et Seigneur de la ville</em>, Francis de Beauquerre de P&eacute;guillon (1555-68), and Cardinal Louis of Lorraine (1568-78). Others who also worked conscientiously, by furthering the internal reforms in conformity with the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, were Charles II of Lorraine (1578-1607); Cardinal Annas von Givry (1608-12), and Henry of Bourbon, Marquis of Verneull (1612-52). Under the last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was transferred to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in accordance with the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>. Through sales, mortgages, and loans, the temporal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> had become very much dismembered; but <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> wanted as far as possible, to re-establish a complete district out of the transferred <em>districtus Metensis</em>. The Assembly Chamber decided what enfeoffment and dependencies had belonged to the newly acquired district, and confiscated a considerable number owing to the frivolous Assembly quarrel. The <em>Province des Trois &eacute;v&ecirc;ches</em> (see above) was formed out of the temporal provinces of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, also out of lands relinquished by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>.

<p>Under French rule the conflict over the right of filling the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> at once broke out, which right <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> claimed and in 1664 obtained from <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>. As a general rule the crown nominated worthy <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>: George II of Aubusson (1668-97), Henri Charles du Cambout (1697-1732) and Claude de Rouvray Saint-Simon (1733-60) who in 1736 assumed the title of prince <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The last prince <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Cardinal Louis de Montmorency-Laval (1761-1802) fled to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> on the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French revolution</a> (died 1808 at Altona). The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> and the Constitution civile du clerg&eacute; broke up the old organization of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and installed a constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who, however, in 1793, was thrown into jail. The <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat</a> between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> (1801) restored the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> with a different diocese, the three Departments of Moselle, Ardennes, and For&ecirc;ts were allotted to it, and it was placed under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>. Peter Francis Bienaim&eacute; (1802-06), the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the new diocese, divided the territory into 90 proper and 1251 auxiliary <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. In 1817 that portion of the Departments of Ardennes and For&ecirc;ts which became <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> territory was separated (the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Joseph Jauffret, 1806-23) and in 1821 the remainder of Ardennes and For&ecirc;ts, so that Metz had only 30 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 418 subordinate <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. After Jauffret, who instituted the yearly <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod, followed Jacob Francis Besson (1824-42), then Paul George Maria Dupont des Loges (1843-86), founder of the boys' training <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in Montigny near Metz. In 1871 the diocese became part of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, and the new boundaries of <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a> became also the boundaries of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. In 1874 it was separated from the Metropolitanate of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a> and placed immediately under the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a> destroyed many institutions in Metz founded by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of that city. On the death of Dupont des Loges, who on account of his outspoken French opinions, was always at loggerheads with the German Government, succeeded in 1886 Ludwig Fleck, coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from 1881, and after him the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Willibord Benzler, former <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/09658a.htm">Maria-Laach</a> (born 16 October, 1853).

<p>The present Diocese of Metz comprising the District of Lorraine covers an area of 2400 square miles and on 1 December, 1905, numbered 533,389 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 74,167 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, 1060 Dissenters, and 7165 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is divided into 4 archdiaconates, and 36 archpresbyterates; in 1910 it contained 641 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> besides 73 missions; 893 secular, and 36 regular, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.
