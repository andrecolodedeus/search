<h1>Michael Augustine Corrigan</h1>  

<p>Third <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of New York, b. 13 August, 1839, at <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a>, <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>, d. at New York, 5 May, 1900. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were natives of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. After graduating at Mt. St. Mary's College, Emmittsburg, Md, in 1859, he entered the College of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was one of the twelve students with whom the North American College was opened there, 8 December, 1859. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 19 September, 1863, and received there the degree of Doctor of Divinity in 1864. Returning to his native diocese in September, 1864, he was successively professor of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> and of Scripture, vice-president and president of Seton Hall College and Seminary, and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> until 1873, when on 4 May he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a>. His administration, during the seven years of its continuance, was characterized by unceasing and successful efforts to bring the regulation of the spiritual and temporal affairs of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> into strict accordance with the prescriptions and recommendations of the plenary council of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> that had been held previous to his accession to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>.

<p>The declining health of Cardinal McCloskey, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of New York, requiring the appointment of a coadjutor, the young <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a> was named, 1 October, 1880, titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11777b.htm">Petra</a>, with the right of succession for New York, and on the death of Cardinal McCloskey in October, 1885, he assumed charge. Having taken an active part in the proceedings of the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1884) as the representative of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, his first important act as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was to convoke a synod of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, in November, 1886, to carry into effect the decrees of the council. The considerable changes made by the council in the status of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and its provisions for the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> as to their subordinate officials, were adopted. A new <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, to replace that of St. Joseph's, Troy, was built at Dunwoodie, and opened September, 1896. The unfinished towers of St. Patrick's Cathedral were completed. The <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">Orphan Asylums</a> on Fifth and Madison Avenues were transferred to a new suburban location at Kingsbridge. The construction of the Lady Chapel of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, through funds donated by a generous <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, was begun.

<p>During the municipal election of 1886 Archbishop Corrigan deemed it his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to disapprove the socialistic character of the writings and addresses of one of the candidates for the mayoralty. This brought about the most disturbing incident, perhaps, of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> administration, the difference between himself and a prominent member of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the Rev. Dr. Edward McGlynn, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Stephen's Church, New York city, occasioned by the latter's advocacy of opinions which the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> believed were not in accord with <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> on the subject of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The controversy began in 1886 with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman's</a> appearance on the public platform, in behalf of one of the candidates for mayor, who stood for certain novel <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> theories, and led to the privation of his pastoral office. Not complying afterwards with the order of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, to proceed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he incurred the sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>.

<p>There resulted some commotion in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and other circles, accentuated later (1892) by a new phase which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> School question assumed in its relation to the State. A period of much public discussion and excitement followed which, however, began to subside rapidly when Dr. McGlynn was relieved of the censure by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a>, then <a href="../cathen/13486a.htm">Archbishop Satolli</a>, and obeyed the summons of the Holy Father. In 1894 Archbishop Corrigan appointed Dr. McGlynn <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Mary's Church, Newburgh, where he remained until his death in 1901.

<p>On May 4th, 1898, Archbishop Corrigan celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of his episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Laymen, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and many prominent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> assembled to testify to his virtues as an ecclesiastic and as a citizen. He made his last <em>ad limina Apostolorum</em> in 1900. Two years afterwards, returning from a confirmation visit to the <a href="../cathen/02204a.htm">Bahamas</a>, he contracted a cold, which, aggravated by an accident, caused his death on May 5th of the same year. The manifestation of sentiments of respect and affection on that event was not only local but national. From the beginning of his episcopate in New York, he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to face the problem of the great influx of foreign, especially Italian, immigration and its religious requirements. He had to guide and direct the charitable and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> interests of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> which rapidly and widely expanded during his administration. Through the seventeen years of his rule he was instrumental in the increase of the churches, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and stations of the archdiocese by one hundred and eighty-eight, of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> by two hundred and eighty-four, of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> by seventy-five. His scholarship was deep and wide extending to every branch of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> learning; his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> marked but unobtrusive; his methods gentle but firm. His devotion, his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and his unceasing labours in behalf of religion make him a conspicuous figure in the history of the American Church of the nineteenth century. The only literary production that his busy life as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> permitted him to publish was a "Register of the Clergy laboring in the Archdiocese of New York from early missions to 1885", which he compiled for the "Historical Records and studies" of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> History Society (Jan., 1889, sqq.).
