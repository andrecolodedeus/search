<h1>Michael Egan</h1>  

<p>First <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Philadelphia, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> b. in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, most probably in <a href="../cathen/06373a.htm">Galway</a>, in 1761; d. at Philadelphia, 22 July, 1814. Entering the Order of St. Francis he was rapidly advanced to important offices. In his twenty-sixth year he was appointed guardian of St. Isidore's, the house of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and held this position for three years, when he was transferred to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. After labouring for several years as a missionary in his native land, he responded to an earnest appeal of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Lancaster, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, and went to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Though lacking the constitution demanded by the pastoral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of that pioneer age, and suffering often from sickness, Father Egan's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and his eloquence in the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> gained universal recognition, and, in April, 1803, he was appointed by Bishop Carroll one of the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> of St. Mary's church in Philadelphia. On 8 April, 1808, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pope Pius VII</a> erected this city into an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, with Michael Egan as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Archbishop Carroll describes him to the Roman authorities as "a man of about fifty who seems endowed with all the qualities to discharge with perfection all the functions of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>, except that he lacks robust health, greater experience and a greater degree of firmness in his disposition. He is a learned, modest, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who maintains the spirit of his Order in his whole conduct." Owing to the <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> troubles, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a> did not reach America until the year 1810. On 28 Oct. Bishop Egan was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Archbishop Carroll in St. Peter's church, Baltimore. His brief episcopate was embittered and his health shattered by the contumacious behaviour of the lay trustees of St. Mary's church, which he had chosen for his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. These trustees, who were tainted with the irreligious notions of the times, without any legal right, and contrary to the canons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, claimed the privilege of electing and deposing their <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and of adjusting their salaries. This un-Catholic contention that "the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> own the churches and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are their hired servants" disturbed the peace, retarded the progress, and threatened the existence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion in <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> during two episcopates. Bishop Egan's troubles were aggravated by the insubordination of two <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> whom he had admitted to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, James Harold and his better-known nephew, William Vincent Harold. Bishop Egan died worn out by his struggles to maintain his episcopal authority.
