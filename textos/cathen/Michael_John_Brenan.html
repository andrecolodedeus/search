<h1>Michael John Brenan</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical historian</a>, born in Kilkenny, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in 1780; died at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, February, 1847. He was the son of a stonemason and after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, speedily obtained reputation as a preacher, but, owing to his vanity and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, came into collision with his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and was suspended. He then left the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, became a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, and was taken up by the Priests' Protection Society under whose auspices he was announced to preach in St. George's Church, Dublin. In the meantime he reconsidered his position and repented of his folly. He resolved to make public reparation for his fault, and on the Sunday in 1809, when he was announced to commence his campaign against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he ascended the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of St. George's, began by blessing himself most reverently, and then to the relief of his audience took up the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, and said "This is the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". After a brief pause, he added deliberately and earnestly, "And I swear by its contents that every word I have uttered against the Catholic <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is a lie", and at once left the building. He went to a neighbouring <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> friary, explained what had happened, and begged to be admitted into the order. After some time, his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were granted, and he became a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> at Wexford where in later years he wrote (as a penance, it is said) his valuable "Ecclesiastical History of Ireland" (2 vols., Dublin, 1840, revised ed., 1864).
