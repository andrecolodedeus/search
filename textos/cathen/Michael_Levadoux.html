<h1>Michael Levadoux</h1>  

<p>One of the first band of <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> who, owing to the distressed state of religion in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, went to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and founded St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore; born at <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont-Ferrand</a>, in Auvergne, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 1 April, 1746; died at Le-Puy-en-Velay, 13 Jan., 1815. He entered the Sulpician Seminary at <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>, 30 Oct., 1769, where he studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, then went to the "Solitude", or Sulpician <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, for one year. He was appointed, in 1774, director of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, where he remained till 1791. In consequence of the threatening aspect of affairs in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Rev. J. A. Emery, Superior-General of the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, deemed it prudent to found a house of their institute in some foreign country, and at the suggestion of Cardinal Dugnani, <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was chosen. Negotiations were opened with Bishop Carroll, but lately <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, and after some delay Rev. Francis C. Nagot, S.S., was named first director of the projected <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. With him were associated MM. Levadoux, Tessier, Gamier, and Montd&eacute;sir, together with several seminarians. Rev. M. Delavau, Canon of <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03640a.htm">Chateaubriand</a> joined the party, which sailed from St. Malo, 8 April, 1791, and after a tempestuous and roundabout voyage reached Baltimore 10 July. For one year M. Levadoux, as treasurer, assisted M. Nagot in organizing the Seminary of St. Mary's, and was then sent by the latter to the Illinois mission, for which M. Emery had at first destined M. Chicosneau, deeming M. Levadoux a better administrator of temporal affairs. Empowered as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> by Bishop Carroll, he took his departure for the West on 15 Jan., 1792.

<p>His missionary labours centred around Cahokia and Kaskaskia. The registers of the latter place bear his signature from Dec., 1792, and he seems to have spent most of his time from 1793 to 1796 at Cahokia, though after M. Flaget left Vincennes in 1795 he visited that post also. Meanwhile as the health of M. Nagot, superior of the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was failing fast, he was desirous of having M. Levadoux near him at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, that he might be ready to succeed him in office; but Bishop Carroll was no less anxious to secure the services of the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> missionary for Detroit. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> wishes prevailed, and M. Levadoux became <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of St. Anne's in 1796. It was he who performed the obsequies of Rev. F. X.  Dufaux, S.S., missionary to the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a> at the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of the Assumption opposite Detroit, who died at his post 10 September, 1796. After the demise of the latter, M. Levadoux had frequent occasion to minister to the spiritual wants of the Indians and of other scattered <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from Sandusky and Mackinaw to Fort Wayne. In 1801 M. Nagot recalled M. Levadoux to <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and in 1803 he received orders from M. Emery to return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he was soon appointed superior of the Seminary of St. Flour in Auvergne, and remained there until the dispersion of the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a>, in 1811. When their institute was revived, in 1814, the Rev. M. Duclaux, successor of M. Emery, placed M. Levadoux at the head of the Seminary of Le-Puy-en-Velay. For years he had been suffering from the stone, which disease was the cause of his death in the following year. He bore the intense pains of his last illness with exemplary <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and resignation.
