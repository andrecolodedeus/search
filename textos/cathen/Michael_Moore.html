<h1>Michael Moore</h1>  

<p>(Or MOOR)

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priest</a>, preacher, and professor, b. at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1640; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 22 Aug., 1726. <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and rhetoric at the Coll&egrave;ge des Grassins. Returning to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1684, and appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Diocese of Dublin</a> by Archbishop Russell. When the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">Revolution of 1688</a> drove James II from his British dominions, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was held for him by Richard Talbot, Earl (afterwards Duke) of Tyrconnell. The <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of Trinity College, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, Dr. Huntingdon, fled to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> when James landed in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The college was seized by the <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was made a powder magazine, one portion of the building was turned into a barrack, and another into a gaol for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> suspected of disaffection to the royal cause. Moore was <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and confessor to Tyrconnell through whose influence and on the recommendation of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, he was appointed (1689) by James, <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of Trinity College &mdash; the only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> who ever held that position. He upheld the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the college, secured it from further pillage, and endeavoured to mitigate the treatment of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>. With the librarian, Father McCarthy, he prevented the soldiery from burning the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, and by preserving its precious collections rendered an incalculable service to letters. A sermon which he preached in Christ Church <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> offended the king so deeply that he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to resign (1690), and retired to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. When James, after the battle of the Boyne (1690), fled to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Moore removed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, became Censor of Books, and won the favour of <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> and <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>. When <a href="../cathen/02285a.htm">Cardinal Barbarigo</a> established his college at <a href="../cathen/10529a.htm">Montefiascone</a>, he appointed Moore <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, and professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and Greek. The college attracted men of learning, and received from <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> an annual grant of two thousand crowns. After the death of James II (1701), Moore returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where through <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Cardinal de Noailles</a>, he was appointed Rector of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> (10 Oct., 1701 to 9 Oct., 1702). He was also made principal of the Coll&egrave;ge de Navarre, and professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, Greek, and Hebrew in the Coll&egrave;ge de France. In 1702 he was selected to deliver the annual panegyric on <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, founded by the City of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Moore joined Dr. Farrelly (Fealy) in purchasing a house near the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a> for poor <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> students. Blind for some years he had to employ an amanuensis, who took advantage of his master's affliction to steal and sell many hundred volumes of his choice <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. What remained Moore bequeathed to the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a>. He died in the Coll&egrave;ge de Navarre, and was buried in the vault under the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a>. His published works include: "De Existentia Dei, et Humanae Mentis Immortalitate, secundum Cartesii et Aristotelis Doctrinam" (Paris. 1692); "Hortatio ad Studium Linguae Graecae et Hebraicae" (Montefiascone 1700); "Vera Sciendi Methodus" (Paris, 1716).
