<h1>Michael Scotus</h1>  

<p>(SCOTT or SCOT)

<p>A thirteenth century mathematician, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and scholar. He was born in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, about the year 1175. The contention that he was an Irishman seems to be disposed of by the fact that when, in 1223, he was offered the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, he declined on the ground that he was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> language. It is not clear whether "Scotus" indicates merely a native of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, or one of the clan Scott, or Scot, which was very numerous in the Scottish lowlands. There is a tradition to the effect that he studied first at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, and afterwards at the Universities of Oxford and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. At the last mentioned place he was known as "the mathematician", which implies that he studied in the <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">Faculty of Arts</a>. it is probable that he studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> also. At any rate, he was beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>. It seems likely that, on leaving <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he visited the <a href="../cathen/02641b.htm">University of Bologna</a>, before repairing to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, to the Court of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>. This occurred about 1200. At Palermo, he joined the circle of learned men who surrounded the emperor; by some, indeed, he is said to have been elevated to the rank of imperial tutor, although the Manuscripts, as a rule, entitled him "<em><a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrologer</a></em> to the Lord Emperor Frederick". In 1209 he went to Toledo, made the acquaintance of several distinguished Arabian scholars and wrote his "Abbreviatio Avicenn&aelig;", the Manuscript, of which bears the date 1210. He also took up the study of <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a> and <a href="../cathen/01272b.htm">alchemy</a>, and translated from the Arabic several works on those subjects. That he was interested in the philosophy of the Arabians is evident from the fact that he translated several <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> commentaries of <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a>.

<p>After his return to <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, about 1220, Michael devoted special attention to the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and practice of medicine. He received several signs of pontifical as well as imperial favour. By Pope <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> he was offered several <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>, among them being the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. He was also offered the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> both by Honorius in 1223, and by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> in 1227. In this case, however, it was the unwillingness of the local <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and not that of the candidate himself that stood in the way of Michael's preferment. His disappointment is, according to his latest biographer, reflected in the gloomy "prophecies" which he composed about this time, and which were so well known during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. According to <a href="../cathen/13111b.htm">Roger Bacon</a>, Michael visited Oxford "about the year 1230", bearing with him "certain books of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and commentaries of learned men concerning physics, and mathematics". The <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death is uncertain; it is generally given as 1234. The legend which grew up around the name of Michael Scot was due to his extraordinary reputation as a scholar and an adept in the secret arts. He figures as a magician in <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante's</a> "Inferno" in <a href="../cathen/02607a.htm">Boccaccio's</a> "Decamerone", in local Italian and Scottish folk-lore, and in Sir Walter Scott's "Lay of the Last Minstrel". The most important of his original works are; <ul><li>(1) "Liber Physiognomi&aelig;", first printed in 1477, and since then reprinted eighteen times in various languages; <li>(2) "Astronomia", still in Manuscript in the Bodleian Library; <li>(3) "Liber Introductorius", also in Manuscript, ibid.; <li>(4) "Liber Luminis Luminum", in a Manuscript of the Riciardi coll., Florence; <li>(5) "De Alchimia", in Manuscript in Corpus Christi College, <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">Oxford</a>.</ul>

<p>Besides the translations mentioned above, a Latin version of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> "Ethics" made from the Greek text is sometimes attributed to Michael Scot.
