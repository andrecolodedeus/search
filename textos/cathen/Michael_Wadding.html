<h1>Michael Wadding</h1>  

<p>(GODINEZ).

<p>Mystical <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, born at Waterford, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in 1591; died in Mexico, Dec. 1644. At an early age he lost his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, Thomas Wadding, and his mother, Marie Valois. For two years he studied at the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Salamanca, entering the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, 15 April, 1609. After years at the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of Villagarcia he obtained permission to go to the missions of Mexico, where he took the name of Godinez, by which he is best known. He made his profession, 26 Aug., 1626. He devoted several years to the rough mission of <a href="../cathen/14012a.htm">Sinaloa</a>, and in 1620 he was among the Mayos and the Tephanes; he also took charge of the Comicaris, and, at the cost of much labour, won over the Basiroas, whom he joined to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> tribes. He relates in his "Teologia mistica" (I, 3, VIII), as one who endured them himself, the privations and sufferings undergone by the missionaries. He taught for several years in various colleges in Mexico. Father Alegre remarks that according to the archives of his province he died on 18 Dec., and not 12, as is generally stated in agreement with Father La Reguera. Michael Wadding was distinguished by his profound <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> states and by rare <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in the direction of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. His "Practica de la teologia mistica", the fruit of long personal experience rather than of study, was published nearly 40 years after his death (1681), and has gone through 10 editions; but outside of Spanish it is chiefly known by the voluminous commentary of Father Manuel La Reguera (2 vols. in fol., Rome, 1740-45). In his notice of the author La Reguera also ascribes to him a "Life of Sister Mary of Jesus". Godinez certainly left notes on this Servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> whom he had directed, but it does not seem that they were ever published.
