<h1>Michael of Cesena</h1>  

<p>(MICHELE FUSCHI)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friar Minor</a>, Minister General of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/03546b.htm">Cesena</a>, a small town in Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, near Forl&igrave;, about 1270; died at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 29 Nov., 1342. Of his early life little is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Having entered the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, he studied at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and took the doctor's degree in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. He taught <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at Bologna and wrote several commentaries on <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and the "Sentences" of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>. At the general chapter of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> (31 May, 1316) he was elected minister general and went at once to <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, where he convoked a chapter to consider the revision of the Constitutions of the order. Returning to Bologna, he issued the document, "Gravi qua premor" (21 Aug., 1316), which, together with several other ordinances regarding the matter of poverty, induced <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> to publish the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Quorumdam exigit" (7 Oct., 1317) whose purpose was to explain the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> of <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a>, "Exiit qui seminat" (13 Aug., 1279), and of <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, "Exivi de paradiso" (6 May, 1312). As it concerned the principal chapter of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Rule, this action caused no little disturbance within the order. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was warmly opposed by Michael and his party, who claimed that in adopting the strict poverty upon which Michael had insisted in his letters, they were following the example and teaching of Christ and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Thus the controversy finally shifted to a speculative <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> question: whether or not it was consonant with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> to hold that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the Apostles had no <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> individually or in common; and while in the famous dispute at Narbonne in 1321 the inquisitor, John of Belna, claimed that it was <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> of Perpignan declared it a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> in perfect accordance with the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> of <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> and <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>. The matter having been brought before <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, a further attempt to settle the controversy was made by distinguishing between dominion and simple use, so that both propositions, Christ and the Apostles had no <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, i.e., dominion of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and Christ and the Apostles possessed <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, i.e., the use of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Quia nonnunquam" (26 March, 1322) the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> declared that he intended merely to explain the decrees of his predecessors, and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> anyone who attempted to misconstrue the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Constitution "Quorumdam exigit". In June of the same year a general chapter of the order was convoked at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> and decided that to assert that Christ and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> possessed no earthly goods was not only not <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, but sound and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>. At the same time <a href="../cathen/02646a.htm">Bonagratia of Bergamo</a> was commissioned to represent the chapter before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. The controversy continued unabated until, in 1327, Michael was summoned to appear before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He feigned illness and delayed; but obeyed a subsequent summons and was forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under pain of grave censure to leave <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. He was thus unable to attend the chapter held at Bologna in May of the following year (1328); yet despite his absence and the protest of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, he was reelected minister general, the chapter deeming the charges against him insufficient to deprive him of office. Several <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and princes wrote to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in Michael's behalf; but before these letters or the result of the chapter could reach <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, Michael, with <a href="../cathen/15636a.htm">William of Occam</a> and <a href="../cathen/02646a.htm">Bonagratia of Bergamo</a>, who were also retained by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, fled by night (25 May) to a galley sent them by Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>.

<p>At <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, where they were triumphantly received by the party of Louis and were joined by a number of other schismatics, the deposed minister general published a solemn appeal from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to a council (12 Dec., 1328), posted it on the door of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and the next day read to the assembled multitude a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Emperor Louis deposing <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> issued the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Quia vir reprobus", warning the faithful against Michael; and the latter answered in his "Ad perpetuam rei memoriam innotescat quod ego, Fr. Michael" (25 Nov., 1330) and in "Christian&aelig; fidei fundamentum", in which he accused the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in the three <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, "Ad Conditorem Canonum", "Cum inter nonnullos", and "Quia quorumdam". These and "Litteras plurium magistrorum", and "Teste Solomone" which Michael wrote in his own defence, are contained in Occam's Dialogue. The general chapter of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (11 June, 1329), at which Cardinal Bertrand presided, condemned the conduct and writings of Michael and all who took part with him against <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>; and elected <a href="../cathen/06468b.htm">Gerard Odon</a> minister general of the order. The next year (1330) Michael and other schismatics followed Louis to <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. The chapter of Perpignan (25 April, 1331) expelled Michael from the order and sentenced him to perpetual <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. During the latter years of his life he was abandoned by nearly all his sympathizers, but it is probable that he died repentant. His remains, with those of his accomplices, William Occam and <a href="../cathen/02646a.htm">Bonagratia of Bergamo</a>, lie buried in the Barf&uuml;sserkirche at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>.
