<h1>Michaelangelo Morigi (Caravaggio)</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, b. at Caravaggio in 1569, d. at Porto d' Ercole in 1609. His family name was Morigi, but he assumed that of his birthplace, and was known by that almost exclusively. He was the son of a mason, and as a boy worked at preparing the plaster for the fresco <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, acquiring from them a great desire to become an artist. He received no instruction as a youth, but trained himself by copying natural objects, doing the work with such rigid accuracy that in later life he was seldom able to rid himself of a habit of slavish and almost mechanical imitation. After five years of strenuous work he found his way to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, where he carefully studied the works of <a href="../cathen/06564c.htm">Giorgione</a>, and received instruction from an unknown <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>. Thence he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and on account of his poverty engaged himself to Cesare d'Arpino, who employed him to execute the floral and ornamental parts of his pictures. He soon, however, acquired a reputation for his own work, and his accurate imitations of natural objects were attractive. The artist's hot temper, however, led him to trouble, and in a fit of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> he <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">killed</a> one of his friends and had to leave <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in haste. For a while he was at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and then in <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a>, where twice he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the portrait of the Grand Master of the <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">Knights of Malta</a>, but he quarrelled with one of the <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">Order</a>, who threw him into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and it was with difficulty that he escaped, fled to <a href="../cathen/14395b.htm">Syracuse</a> and returned to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. There he obtained a pardon for the manslaughter of his companion, set out again for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> on the way by some <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> who mistook him for another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and when set at liberty found that he had lost his boat and all that it contained. At Porto d' Ercole he fell ill and died of a violent fever.

<p>His <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> are to be found at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>, Paris, St. Petersburg, <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a>, Copenhagen, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and in the national Gallery, London. His colouring is vigorous, extraordinary, and daring; in design he is often careless, in drawing frequently inaccurate, but his flesh tints are exceedingly good, and his skill in lighting, although inaccurate and full of tricks is very attractive. His pictures are distinguished by startling contrasts in light and shadow and by extraordinary effects of light on half-length figures, giving the desired appearance of high relief, the general effect of the remainder of the picture being over sombre.
