<h1>Michel-Eyquen de Montaigne</h1>  

<p>Writer, b. at the ch&#226;teau of Montaigne, in P&eacute;rigord, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, on 28 Feb., 1533; d. there, 13 Sept., 1592. His great-grandfather had been a <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> merchant of wines, salt fish, etc., and it was he who purchased the estate of Montaigne. His father entered the army and married Antoinette de Louppes or Lopes, of Jewish origin, and for two years was mayor of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>. At an early age Michel had a German tutor, who was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to speak to him in Latin only. At the age of six and a half he was sent to the College of Guyenne at <a href="../cathen/02684a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, where he remained seven years. It is believed that he studied <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> and dialectics for two years at the <a href="../cathen/02684a.htm">Bordeaux</a> <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">Faculty of Arts</a>, with Marc-Antoine de Muret as tutor. He afterwards studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, possibly at <a href="../cathen/02684a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, more probably at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. Having become counsellor at the Cour des Aides of P&eacute;rigord, he was soon incorporated like his colleagues in the Parlement of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>. But the new counsellor had no liking for his profession, and he was often absent from the Parlement. From 1561 to 1563 he attended the court. From 1559 he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> La Bo&eacute;tie, his chosen friend, and like himself a counsellor in the Parlement of P&eacute;rigord and his elder by six years; but death soon separated them (1563).

<p>Two years later Montaigne married Fran&#231;oise de la Chassaigne, the daughter of a parliamentary advocate. They had five daughters, only one of whom survived him. In 1570 at the age of thirty-seven he sold his post of counsellor, and in the following year retired to the ch&#226;teau de Montaigne. There, from 1571 to 1580, he wrote his "Essays". The first edition of this work contained only two books. He then set out on a journey which lasted a year and a half, of which he has written in his "Journal." He went to Lorraine and Alsace, started for <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, crossed <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and came down to the Tyrol, saw <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the end of his journey, where he received letters of citizenship. During his absence he had been made mayor of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, which office he held for four years (1581-85), his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> coming to an end when the pest broke out. Montaigne being absent from the town did not feel <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to return to it. In 1588 he published a new edition of his "Essays", corrected and augmented by a third book. He continued to revise his work until his death. In 1595 Mlle de Gournay, the young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who at the age of twenty-two became his enthusiastic admirer, and whom he called his daughter, issued a new edition, in which she inserted the revisions and additions when he had indicated in a copy in 1588.

<p>It is impossible to analyse the "Essays". They are a long conversation in which the author sets forth in haphazard fashion his memories and his reflections. His memories are the result of his personal experience and especially of his very extensive reading. According to his own expression he himself is "the subject of his book". But what excuses him is doubtless the fact that in depicting himself he often depicts <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in general. He is a charming conversationalist, a writer full of pith and colour, artlessness, grace, and life. His literary merits add to the dangers of his book, which is deliberately lascivious and as a whole openly favourable to the <a href="../cathen/12587a.htm">Pyrrhonians</a>. He has even written that it is "a slack ear for a shapely head". However, on the other hand, he thanked "our sovereign Creator for having stayed our trust on the everlasting foundation of His holy word". He also said that outside of the path pointed out by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> reason "is lost, embarrassed, shackled". In a letter he relates in a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> manner the <a href="../cathen/04660c.htm">Christian death</a> of his friend La Bo&eacute;tie. He himself, as soon as he became ill, would not send for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and in his last illness did not depart from this custom. Pasquier relates that he "caused Mass to be said in his chamber and when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> came to the elevation the poor gentleman raised himself as well as he could in bed with hands joined and thus yielded his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". He died therefore in a supreme act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.
