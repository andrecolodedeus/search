<h1>Michel Baius</h1>  

<p>(Or M<font size=-2>ICHEL</font> <font size=-2>DE</font> B<font size=-2>AY</font>)

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a> and author of a system known as Baianism, was b. at Melun in Hainaut, 1513, and d. at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> 16 September, 1589. Though poor, he succeeded in procuring, in the various colleges of the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> University, a complete course of studies, including humanities, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. His first appointment, immediately after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, was as principal of the Standonk College, 1541. Three years later he was given the chair of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which he retained till 1550. In that year he took the degree of Doctor of Theology, was made President of the College Adrien and also substitute to the professor of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, then absent at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, the full professorship following two years later at the titular's death. Baius had very early formed a close friendship with <a href="../cathen/07300a.htm">John Hessels</a>. While the three leaders of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>: Tapper, Chancellor; <a href="../cathen/12667a.htm">Ravestein</a>, Professor of Theology; and Hasselius, Professor of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, were at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, Baius and <a href="../cathen/07300a.htm">Hessels</a> profited by their absence to give vent to long cherished <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and introduce new methods and new doctrines. On his return from <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, in 1552, Chancellor Tapper found that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> influences had been at work and asked <a href="../cathen/06727a.htm">Cardinal de Granvelle</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, to interfere. <a href="../cathen/06727a.htm">Granvelle</a> succeeded in quieting the innovators for awhile, but Tapper's death, in 1559, became the signal of fresh disturbances. At the request of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, the Sorbonne of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> had censured eighteen propositions embodying the main innovations of Baius and <a href="../cathen/07300a.htm">Hessels</a>. Baius answered the censure in a memoir now lost, and the controversy only increased in acridity. <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pope Pius IV</a>, through <a href="../cathen/06727a.htm">Cardinal Granvelle</a>, imposed silence upon both Baius and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, without, however, rendering any <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> decision. When the sessions of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> were resumed, in 1561, Baius and <a href="../cathen/07300a.htm">Hessels</a> were selected to represent the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, <a href="../cathen/03223a.htm">Commendone</a>, objected to the choice of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06727a.htm">Cardinal de Granvelle</a> thought that the two innovators' presence at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a> would be good both for them and for the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In 1563 he sent them to <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, not, however, as delegates of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, but as <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Just before leaving for <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> Baius had published his first tracts. Unfortunately, the contents of those tracts were not within the programme of the last three sessions of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and no public discussion of the disputed points took place. It is known, however, that Baius' and <a href="../cathen/07300a.htm">Hessels'</a> views were distasteful to the Fathers, and that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> king's prestige alone saved them from formal condemnation.

<p>Baius returned to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in 1564 and the same year published new tracts which, with the addition of another series, were collected in "Opuscula omnia", in 1566, the year of <a href="../cathen/07300a.htm">Hessels'</a> death. It is likely that <a href="../cathen/07300a.htm">Hessels</a> collaborated with Baius in these "Opuscula". Their defence rested now on Baius alone, and it was no small task. <a href="../cathen/12667a.htm">Ravestein</a>, who had succeeded Tapper as chancellor, thought it was high time to call a halt, and informed <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, requesting decisive action; 1 October, 1567, <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pope Pius V</a> signed the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Ex omnibus afflictionibus", in which were to be found a number of condemned propositions, but without mention of Baius' name. According to the usage of the Roman Chancery, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> document was without punctuation, divisions, or numbers. Again, as had been done before in several instances, the objectionable propositions were not censured severally, but to the whole series were applied various "notes", from "heretical" down to "offensive". Moreover, not only was Baius' name not mentioned, but for obvious reasons of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in those days, so near the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, the text itself was not to be made public. Those facts gave occasion to many quibbles on the part of the Baianists: What was the exact number of propositions?&mdash;76, 79, or 80?&mdash;Were they, or were they not, Baius' propositions?&mdash;Why had not a copy of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> been given to those on whose <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> it was supposed to reflect? In the famous sentence, "quas quidem sententias stricto coram nobis examine ponderatas quamquam nonnull&aelig; aliquo pacto sustineri possent in rigore et proprio verborum sensu ab assertoribus intento h&aelig;reticas, erroneas . . . damnamus", was the <em>comma Pianum</em> to be placed after <em>intento</em> or after <em>possent,</em> the meaning being reversed according as the comma came after the one or the other word? Nevertheless Baius did not stoop to these evasions at first, but when the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> (1567) was brought to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and read to the faculty, he subscribed with the other professors. Meanwhile, the text of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> having been divulged by some indiscreet <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, Baius began to find fault with it and wrote to, or for, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> two lengthy apologies, in vindication, he said, not so much of himself as of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. The tone of the apologies was respectful in appearance rather than in reality. By a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1579, <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> answered that the case had been maturely examined and finally adjudged, and demanded submission. After much tergiversation, wherein he stooped to the ridiculous evasion of the <em>comma Pianum</em> and the practical stultification of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> act, Baius <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> to Morillon, <a href="../cathen/06727a.htm">de Granvelle's</a> vicar-general, all the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> condemned in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, but was not then and there required to sign his recantation. The absence of that formality contributed later to revive the discussions. In 1570, at <a href="../cathen/12667a.htm">Ravestein's</a> death, Baius became dean of the faculty. Then rumors went abroad that the new dean was by no means in accord with <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> teaching. Followers and adversaries suggested a clear pronouncement. It came under the title of the "Explicatio articulorum", in which Baius averred that, of the many condemned propositions, some were <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and justly censured, some only ill expressed, while still others, if at variance with the terminology of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>, were yet the genuine sayings of the Fathers; at any rate, with more than forty of the seventy-nine articles he claimed to have nothing whatever to do. Baius, after two recantations, was simply reverting to his original position. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was then solemnly published at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and subscribed by the whole faculty. Baius accepted it again. His apparent magnanimity even won him sympathy and preferments; he was in quick succession made Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, Dean of St. Peter's Collegiate Church, and "conservator" of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university's</a> privileges. Thus was peace restored, but only for a while.



<p>Certain inconsiderate views of the master regarding the authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and even of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and, on the part of his disciples, the ill disguised hope that <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> might declare void all that had been done by his predecessor, bade fair to reopen the whole question. <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a> would not permit this. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Provisionis nostr&aelig;" (1579), confirmed the preceding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> acts and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Toletus* was commissioned to receive and bring to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the final <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a> of Baius. We have it under the name of "Confessio Michaelis Baii". It reads, in part: "I am convinced that the condemnation of all those propositions is just and lawful. I confess that very many (<em>plurimas</em>) of these propositions are in my books, and in the sense in which they are condemned. I renounce them all and resolve never more to teach or defend any of them." Despite this recantation, Baius' <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> had sunk too deep into his mind not to occasionally crop up in rash tenets. Up to the last few years of his life sad contests were raised by, or around, him, and nothing short of the official admission by the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> of a compact body of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> could quell those contests. Baius died in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to which his studiousness, attainments, and rashness came near to infringing. The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> seed he had sown bore fruits of bitterness later on in the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>.
<h2>His system</h2>

<p>Baius' system has been conveniently called Baianism, as a more objective name for it would be difficult to find. It is contained in a series of <em>opuscula</em>, or pamphlets: "On Free Will"; "Justice and Justification"; "Sacrifice"; "Meritorious Works"; "Man's Original Integrity and the Merits of the Wicked"; "The Sacraments"; "The Form of Baptism"; "Original Sin"; "Charity"; "Indulgences"; "Prayers for the Dead". Baius himself collected all those pamphlets in "M. Baii opuscula theologica" (Louvain, 1566). The Marurist Gerberon gave a more complete edition: "M. Baii opera cum bullis pontificum et aliis ad ipsius causum spectantibus" (Cologne, 1696). This edition was put on the Index in 1697 on account of its second part, or "Baiana", in which the editor gives useful information about, but shows too much sympathy for, Baius. The gist of Baianism is also found in the 79 propositions censured by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, Enchiridion, 881-959). All cavil apart, the first 60 are easily identified in Baius' printed works, and the remaining 19&mdash;"tales quae vulgo circumferrentur", says an old <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> copy of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ex omnibus"&mdash;represent the oral teaching of the Baianist wing. In the preface to "Man's Original Integrity" Baius says: "What was in the beginning the integrity natural to man? Without that question one can understand neither the first corruption of nature (by <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>) nor its reparation by the grace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." Those words give us the sequence of Baianism: (1) the state of innocent nature; (2) the state of fallen nature; (3) the state of redeemed nature.
<h3 id="A">State of innocent nature</h3>

<p>From the fact, so strongly asserted by the Fathers, of the actual conjunction of nature and grace in the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first man</a>, Baius infers their <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> connection or even practical identity. In his view, primitive innocence was not <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, at least in the ordinary acceptation of that word, but due to, and demanded by, the normal condition of humanity (which cannot, without it, remain in the state of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>). And that primitive state, natural to man, included among its <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> requirements destination to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, immunity from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, suffering, and death, and the inherent power of meriting. None of these was, nor could rightly be called, a gratuitous gift of grace.
<h3 id="B">State of fallen nature</h3>

<p>The downfall of man is not, and cannot be, according to Baius, the mere forfeiting of <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gratuitous or supernatural gifts</a>, but some positive <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> reaching deep into our very nature. That <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. By <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> Baius understands, instead of a simple privation of grace, habitual <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> itself, transmitted according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of heredity and developed according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of physical and psychical growth. It is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by itself, even in irresponsible children, and that outside of all relation to a will, be it original or personal. What, then, becomes of human liberty as a source of moral responsibility? Baius does not think it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that, in order to be moral agents, we should be free from internal determinism, but only from external compulsion. From so tainted a source, Redemption apart, only tainted actions can flow. They may sometimes appear virtuous, but it is only an appearance (<em>vitia virtutes imitantia</em>). In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> all human actions, not purified by Redemption, are vices pure and simple and damning vices at that (<em>vitia sunt et damnant</em>).
<h3 id="C">State of redeemed nature</h3>

<p>The gifts of primitive innocence, forfeited by <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, are restored by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Then and then only do they become <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, not, indeed, on account of their <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character, but because of fallen man's positive unworthiness. Aided by grace, the redeemed can perform virtuous actions and acquire merits for <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Does that entail a higher status, an inner renovation or <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>?&mdash;Baius does not consider it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Moral action, whether called <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, or charity, or obedience to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, is the sole instrument of justification and virtue and merit. The r&ocirc;le of grace consists exclusively in keeping <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> under control, and in thus enabling us to perform moral actions and fulfil the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. True, Baius speaks of the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for justification, but this is only a <em>fictio iuris</em>; in fact, a <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or a penitent before <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> may, by simply keeping the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>, have more charity than certain so-called just men. If the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a> and penitent are not styled just, it is only in deference to <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, which requires for complete <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> both newness of life (i.e. moral action) and pardon of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (i.e. of the <em>reatus</em>, or liability to punishment). To grant that kind of pardon is the only object and efficacy of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the dead, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and penance. With regard to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the living, the Eucharist&mdash;the only one on which Baius expressed his views&mdash;has no other sacrificial value than that of being a good moral action drawing us close to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>A mere glance at the above sketch cannot fail to reveal a strange mixture of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>, <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>, and even <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinianism</a>. Baius is a <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> in his concept of the primitive state of man. He is a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> in his presentation of the downfall. He is more than a <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> and little short of the <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinian</a> in his theory of Redemption. Critics <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that all these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> were in a manner harmonized in Baius' mind, but they are not agreed as to what may have been the genetic principle of that <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> formation. Some find it in the 38th proposition: "Omnis amor creatur&aelig; rationalis aut vitiosa est cupiditas, qu&#226; mundus diligitur, qu&aelig; a Joanne prohibetur, aut laudabilis illa charitas, qu&#226; per spiritum sanctum in corde diffus&#226; Deus amatur" (The <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">rational</a> creature's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is either vicious desire, with its attachment to the world, which St. John forbids, or that praiseworthy charity which is poured forth in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and through which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a>). Others see it in a wrong analysis of man, the higher faculties, appertaining to the moral and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, being <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> torn apart from the lower powers, and so magnified as to become identical with grace and the indwelling of the Holy Ghost. Others, again, think it is optimism in appraising man's native condition, or pessimism in gauging his condition after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the result being the same with regard to the value of Redemption. Taking the question from an historical standpoint, we find that Baius was from the beginning a <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> with a perfect enthusiasm for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity in general, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> in particular, and a dislike almost amounting to abhorrence for the thoughts and methods of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">schoolmen</a>. The self-assumed task of interpreting the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle of the Gentiles</a> and the great <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">African Doctor</a> apart from the traditional current of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> thought was perhaps an impossibility in itself, but certainly one for Baius' limited erudition and paradoxical mind. To this all-absorbing mania, much more than to a lack of sincere loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, must we trace Baius' blindness to the already defined <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> and his half-revolts against the living <em>magisterium</em>. A partial explanation of, if not excuse for, that monomania is, however, found in the fact that at the very outset of his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> career Baius came under the influence of men who, like the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Peter <a href="../cathen/14152a.htm">de Soto</a>, believed the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reaction against the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> had gone somewhat too far, and suggested that more stress be laid on Scripture and Patrology and less on <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomism</a>. That, in his intention at least, Baius only wanted to take the most advantageous position in order the better to defend the Faith against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from a letter he wrote (1569) to Cardinal Simonetta: "After reading <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter the Lombard</a> and some other <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> Doctor, I endeavoured to bring <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> back to <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and the writings of the Fathers, those at least who still enjoy some credit with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>: <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, Augustine, Leo, Prosper, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, and the like." Such are the various causes which may in a measure account for the position taken by Baius. The <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> of his writings teaches us little more. It fails to give us a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> insight into the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> development of his thought. It may be, after all, that each of the above-mentioned genetic principles held priority in his mind at different times and in different needs.
<h2>Doctrine of the Church</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a>, already outlined against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> by various councils and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> from the fifth century, is fully presented against the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, especially Session V, <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> on <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">Original Sin</a>, and Session VI, <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> on Justification. In those two sessions, both anterior to Baius' writings, we find three statements which are obviously irreconcilable with Baius' three main positions described above: (1) Man's original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is represented as a <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">supernatural gift</a>; (2) <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">Original Sin</a> is described not as a deep deterioration of our nature, but as the forfeiture of purely gratuitous privileges; (3) Justification is depicted as an interior renovation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by inherent grace. The condemnation by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> of the 79 Baianist tenets is an act of the supreme <em>magisterium</em> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, an <em>ex cathedr&#226;</em> pronouncement. To say, with the Baianists, that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> act condemns not the real and concrete tenets of the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> professor, but only certain hypothetical or imaginary propositions; to pretend that the censure is aimed not at the underlying teaching, but only at the vehemence or harshness of the outward expressions, is to practically stultify the pontifical document. From the tenor of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Ex Omnibus", we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that to each of the 79 propositions one or several or all of the following censures will apply: <em>h&aelig;retica, erronea, suspecta, temeraria, scandalosa, in pias aures offendens</em>. For a more precise determination of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, we have to consult, besides the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, the <em>consensus Catholicorum theologorum</em>. That consensus was voiced with no uncertainty by such <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> as <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Salamanca, Alcal&aacute;, and <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> itself, and by such <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> as Cunerus Petri (d. 1580&mdash;"De grati&#226;", Cologne, 1583); Francisco Su&aacute;rez (d. 1617&mdash;"De grati&#226; Dei" in Op. Omn., VII, Paris, 1857); <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> (d. 1623&mdash;"De grati&#226; et libero arbitrio", in Controversi&aelig;, IV, Milan, 1621); <a href="../cathen/13062b.htm">Ripalda</a> (d. 1648&mdash;"Adversus Baium et Baianos", Paris, 1872); Stayaert (d. 1701&mdash;"In propositiones damnatas assertiones", Louvain, 1753); Tourn&eacute;ly (d. 1729&mdash;"De Grati&#226; Christi", Paris, 1726); Casini (d. 1755&mdash;"Quid est homo?" ed. <a href="../cathen/13525b.htm">Scheeben</a>, Mainz, 1862). It should not, however, be omitted here that, even apart from <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, which is a direct offshoot of Baianism, some traces of Baius' confused <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> about the natural and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> are to be found here and there in the history of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The Augustinian School, represented by such able men as <a href="../cathen/11103a.htm">Noris</a>, Bellelli, and Berti, adopted, though with qualifications, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of man's natural aspiration to the possession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. The standard work of that <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, "Vindici&aelig; Augustinian&aelig;", was even once denounced to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, but no censure ensued. More recently Stattler, <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">Hermes</a>, G&uuml;nther, Hirscher, and <a href="../cathen/08703a.htm">Kuhn</a> evolved a notion of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> which is akin to that of Baius. While admitting relatively <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">supernatural gifts</a>, they denied that the partaking of Divine nature and the adoption to eternal life differ essentially from our natural moral life. That theory was successfully opposed by <a href="../cathen/08667a.htm">Kleutgen</a> and seems now to have died out. The new French theory of "immanence", according to which man postulates the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, may also have some kinship with Baianism, but it can only be mentioned here as it is yet the centre of rather fervid discussions. Matulewicz, "Doctrina Russorum de Statu iustiti&aelig; originalis" (Cracow, 1903), says that modern Russian <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> embodies in great measure the condemned views of Baius.
