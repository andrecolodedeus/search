<h1>Michel Beno&icirc;t</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a> (or Dijon), <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 8 October, 1715; died at Peking, 23 October, 1774, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> scientist, for thirty years in the service of Kien Lung, Emperor of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. He studied at <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, and at St. Sulpice, Paris, and entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Novitiate at <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>, 18 March, 1737. After three years of renewed entreaties, he was granted his desire of the Chinese mission, but before his departure completed his <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> studies at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> under de l'Isle, de la Caille, and Le Monnierr, who attached much importance to his later correspondence. On his arrival at Peking in 1744 (or 1745), a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was raging against the missionaries in the provinces; still, as their scientific ability made them indispensable to the government, Father Beno&icirc;t was retained at court and entrusted with the task of designing and carrying out a great system of decorative fountains in the royal gardens. He spent many years in this work, for which he evinced rare talent. He built <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> houses within the enclosures of these gardens and in front of one, in the Italian style of architecture, he constructed a curious water clock. The Manchu characterize the twelve hours of their day (twenty-four hours, <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> time) by twelve animals of different species. On two sides of a large triangular basin of water Father Beno&icirc;t placed figures of these animals, through the mouths of each of which, successively, for two hours, was forced a jet of water by some ingenuous mechanical device. While applying himself to his <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> studies, he taught the emperor the use of the reflecting telescope. Among his numerous works were <ul> <li>a large map of the world (twelve and a half by six and a half feet) to which he added valuable <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> and geographical details. <li>A general chart of the empire and surrounding country, engraved on copper, though at the outset he was little versed in this art as were his Chinese collaborators, whom he had chosen from the best wood-engravers in the country. The work was done on 104 plates (two feet two inches by one foot two inches, Chinese measure). </ul> Sixteen designs of the emperor's battles had been engraved on copper in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, at the expense of Louis XV, and when these were sent to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, with numerous prints made from them, the emperor immediately desired Father Beno&icirc;t to print further copies. This required new presses for these delicately wrought French plates. new methods of wetting the paper, distributing ink, etc. The result was successful, even rivaling the work done in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but it was Father Beno&icirc;t's last service. He died of apoplexy, ripe in religious and apostolic virtues. The emperor said of him, "That was a good man, and generous in his service"; a missionary remarked, on hearing this, that, had the words been said of a Tartar or Chinese, they would have rendered illustrious a long line of descendants. Father Beno&icirc;t was the author of many letters, preserved in the "Lettres edifiantes"; he translated into Chinese "the Imitation of Christ," while in the "M&eacute;moires sur les Chinois" are many memoirs, descriptions, and sketches ascribed to him, but unsigned.
