<h1>Michel Corneille (the Younger)</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, etcher and engraver, b. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1642; d. at the Gobelins manufactory at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 16 August, 1708. He was the son of an artist, <a href="../cathen/04374a.htm">Michel Corneille</a> of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, and on this account is sometimes called the "younger Michel". He is also and more commonly known as the "elder Corneille" (<em>Corneille l'A&icirc;n&eacute;</em>), to distinguish him from a younger brother, <a href="../cathen/04373c.htm">Jean-Baptiste Corneille</a>, also a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>. His father was the first and the most indefatigable of his teachers; his other masters were <a href="../cathen/10289a.htm">Mignard</a> and the celebrated <a href="../cathen/09106a.htm">Lebrun</a>. Devoting himself wholly to historical <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, Michel won the Academy Prize and went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the king's pension; but feeling his genius hampered by the restrictions of the prize, he gave up the money so that he might study the antique in his own way. Coming under the then powerful influence of the Eclectics, he studied with the <a href="../cathen/03374c.htm">Carracci</a> and modelled his style on theirs. In 1663 he returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and was elected a member of the Royal Academy, his picture on entering being "Our Lord's Appearance to St. Peter after His Resurrection". In 1673 he became an adjunct, and, in 1690, a full, professor in the Academy.

<p>Corneille <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> for the king at <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a>, Meudon, and Fontainebleau, and decorated in fresco many of the great <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> churches, notably Notre-Dame, the church of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Saint-Gr&eacute;goire in the Invalides. His style, reminiscent of the old masters, is the conventional style of the Eclectics; his drawing is remarkably careful and exact, the expression on the faces of his religious subjects is dignified and noble, the management of chiaroscuro excellent, and the composition harmonious, but suggestive of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> School. From his insufficient <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the composition of pigments, the colour in many of his pictures has suffered such a change that it is today disagreeable; but the artist possessed a good colour-sense, and contemporary records go to prove that his colour was refined and pleasing. He etched and engraved over a hundred plates in a bold and free style, for he was a master of the line; but he subsequently spoiled the effect by too much and too precise work with the graver. A dishonest dealer put <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> name on some of Michel Corneille's plates, and for a long time no one disputed their attribution to the great master. For many years Corneille resided at the Gobelins manufactory, and was sometimes called "Corneille des Gobelins". Among his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> are a "Repose in Egypt", now in the Louvre, and a "Baptism of Constantine", in the museum at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>. Among his more important etched and engraved works are: "The Nativity"; "Flight into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>"; "Abraham journeying with Lot" (wrongly ascribed to <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>), and "Jacob wrestling with the Angel", a plate after <a href="../cathen/03374c.htm">Annibale Carracci</a>.
