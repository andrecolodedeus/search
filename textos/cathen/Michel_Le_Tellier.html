<h1>Michel Le Tellier</h1>  

<p>Born 16 October, 1643, of a peasant <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, not at Vire as has so often been said, but at Vast near Cherbourg; died at La Fl&egrave;che, 2 September, 1719. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> in Caen, and at 18 entered the order, and became professor, then <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the College of Louis le Grand. He was one of the founders of the "Journal de Tr&eacute;voux", and opposed <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> in three works: "Observations sur la nouvelle &eacute;dition de la version fran&ccedil;oise du Nouveau Testament" (1672); "Histoire des cinq Propositions de Jansenius" (1699); "Le p&egrave;re Quesnel s&eacute;ditieux et h&eacute;r&eacute;tique" (1705). In 1687 he took part in the discussion then going on about Chinese ceremonies, publishing a book entitled: "D&eacute;fense des nouveaux chr&eacute;tiens et des missionaires de la Chine, du Japon, et des Indes". The tone of this work was displeasing to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> defended it before the Congregation of the Holy Office. Greatly esteemed by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, no matter what Saint-Simon may say about him, Le Tellier, after the death of <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Father P&eacute;tau</a>, was entrusted with the task of finishing his work, "De theologicis dogmatibus". From August 1709 he belonged to the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres. Le Tellier was <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of his order in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> when Father La Chaise, the confessor of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, died, 20 January, 1709. <a href="../cathen/06624a.htm">Godet des Marais</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, and La Ch&eacute;tardie, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of Saint-Sulpice, had a determining part in <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis's</a> choice of Le Tellier as his new confessor. Saint-Simon, giving credence to a story told by a surgeon, Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal, attributed this choice to the king's fear of displeasing the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. For two centuries the greater number of historians have followed Saint-Simon's estimate of Le Tellier and denounced that "dark, false, and dread-inspiring countenance, which would have struck terror if met in a lonely forest", that "coarse, insolent, impudent confessor, knowing neither the world nor moderation, neither rank nor considerations, making no allowance for anything, covering up his purposes by a thousand windings". Scientific history is revising this judgment. Saint-Simon makes Le Tellier responsible for the destruction of Port-Royal. Father Bliard points out that since 1695 Harlay de Champvallon, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> had contemplated its destruction; that the seizure in 1703 of <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel's</a> papers had drawn the king's attention to the political dangers of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>; that as early as 25 March, 1708, <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> at the request of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">King Louis</a> had united Port-Royal des Champs with Port-Royal de Paris and suppressed the title of the "Abbaye des Champs"; and that <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Cardinal de Noailles</a>, who for a year past had <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdicted</a> the members of Port-Royal des Champs from receiving the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, was preparing to use the power given him by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to send the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> to other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>.

<p>Saint-Simon claims that Le Tellier in advising episcopal nominations, relentlessly pursued all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> suspected of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, recommending only "barefooted <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> and men ready for anything". Such slurs indicate the attitude of the great nobleman against <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who lacked birth; but a letter from <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> to which Father Bliard draws attention proves that in reality it was <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> who, at the beginning of Le Tellier's influence, found him too lenient towards certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> tendencies, and pointed out to him the danger he would incur by allowing the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> faction to predominate in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopacy</a>. Saint-Simon, following Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal's stories, accuses Le Tellier of having brought to <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> an opinion of the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the Sorbonne in order to prove that he could levy <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> upon his subjects with a clear <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Even admitting the accuracy of Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal's assertions, it must be borne in mind that the necessity of defending the kingdom was so urgent that <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> wrote on 4 August, 1710, "Money must be taken wherever it can be found", and Duclos in his "M&eacute;moires secrets", declares that "the imposition of the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> was perhaps the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the State."

<p>Le Tellier is accused by Saint-Simon of having in 1713 laboured jointly with <a href="../cathen/09548b.htm">Madame de Maintenon</a> and Bissy, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Meaux, against <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Cardinal de Noailles</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and used his influence with <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, through the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Daubenton and Cardinal Fabroni, to obtain the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>. And again after the publication of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a> he wished to have <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Cardinal de Noailles</a> <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, and he increased the number of "lettres de cachet", in order to fill the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> with <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>. Father Bliard shows the capricious and exaggerated nature of these stories, and establishes from <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> sources that during the six years of Le Tellier's influence, only twenty-eight <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> were punished more or less severely. By the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> Roslet and Daubenton's report to <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a>, he shows that the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a> was the outcome of three long years of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> study, and that the alleged letters from Le Tellier to Chauvelin proving a plot for <a href="../cathen/01032b.htm">abducting</a> <a href="../cathen/11085b.htm">Cardinal de Noailles</a> were admitted to be <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> by Duclos, though he was hostile to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Finally, certain investigations made by Father Brucker lead to the conclusion, that a certain letter recommending the destruction of the Oratory is certainly not the work of Le Tellier, who has been frequently blamed for it, and that such an accusation may have originated in an intrigue of Abb&eacute; de Margon against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> in a codicil to his will had selected Le Tellier as the confessor of the little Louis XV, then seven years of age; but a few days after the king's death the regent, under the influence of Saint-Simon and the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, informed the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> that Le Tellier must leave <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He was sent by his superiors to <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, and then to La Fl&egrave;che, where he died. The <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">menology</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> under the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 2 September, repeats the following remarks addressed by <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> to the Duc d'Harcourt about Le Tellier: "Do you see that man? His greatest <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> would be to shed his blood for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and I do not believe there is a single <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in my entire kingdom who is more fearless and more saintly."
