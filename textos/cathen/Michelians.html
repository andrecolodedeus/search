<h1>Michelians</h1>  

<p>A German <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> which derives its name from "Michel", the popular designation of its founder Johann Michael Hahn, b. of peasant parentage, 2 February, 1758, at Altorf near Stuttgart; d. at Sindlingen near Herrenberg in <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>, 20 January, 1819. Naturally of a deeply religious disposition, he claimed to have been favoured at the age of seventeen with a vision lasting for the space of three hours. From that time on he led a strictly retired life and was a regular attendant at the meetings of the <a href="../cathen/12080c.htm">Pietists</a>. His peculiarities drew forth the energetic disapproval of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, who even resorted to physical <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> against him. But as <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parental</a> opposition resulted in driving the son from home without changing his manner of life, it was soon abandoned as useless. After a seven weeks' vision, alleged to have occurred in 1780, Hahn began to proclaim his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> through speech and writing. Large audiences flocked to his preaching and both the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> instituted proceedings against him. He sought quiet in foreign lands, notably in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, where he met Lavater. From 1794 until his death, he devoted his time, undisturbed, to religious propaganda, living on the estate of Duchess Frances at Sindlingen. While he entertained for some time the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of establishing a distinct community, a plan which was realized at Kornthal near Stuttgart, after his death, neither he nor his followers ever separated completely and permanently from the state Church. The Bible, interpreted not in a literal but a mystical, allegorical sense, occupies, in his religious system, the position of supreme guide in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity of Persons in God</a> is replaced by a threefold manifestation of one and the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">deity</a>. A double fall of man is admitted, for Adam fell first in seeking a consort for the multiplication of the human species, and again in yielding to her suggestion of disobedience. Hence the necessity of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> which is understood mainly in a physical sense, in as much as the Redeemer exudes, in his bloody-sweat, the coarse, sensual elements in man to whom he restores a spiritualized body. A second and proximate advent of Christ is taught; also the ultimate universal <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all beings, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">fallen angels</a> included. Among the sources of his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> Hahn mentions only the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and special personal illumination; his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, however, are undoubtedly related to the views of the <a href="../cathen/14626a.htm">theosophists</a> B&ouml;hme and &Ouml;tinger. His followers, found chiefly among the rural population, are scattered over <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtemberg</a>, <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, and the Palatinate. Their approximate number is 15,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> divided into 26 districts, each of which holds semi-annual conferences. The works of Hahn, comprising 15 volumes, were published posthumously at <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a>, 1819 sqq.
