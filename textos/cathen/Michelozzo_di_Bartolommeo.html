<h1>Michelozzo di Bartolommeo</h1>  

<p>An architect and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, born at Florence circa 1391; died 1472. He exercised a quiet, but far-reaching, influence during the early <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, and for more than a decade worked with <a href="../cathen/05115d.htm">Donatello</a>, to whom several of Michelozzo's works have been <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> attributed. The Aragazzi monument in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/10531a.htm">Montepulciano</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02737a.htm">Brancacci</a> <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> are the work of Michelozzo alone, whilst he assisted <a href="../cathen/05115d.htm">Donatello</a> in the execution of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>. He also modelled several pieces in brass for <a href="../cathen/05115d.htm">Donatello</a>, with whom he collaborated on a <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/12117a.htm">Prato</a>. <a href="../cathen/06544a.htm">Ghiberti</a> received important assistance from him on his "Matthew" and on the bronze <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> door of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Florence. Later on, he made bronze casts of some of <a href="../cathen/13095b.htm">Luca della Robbia's</a> designs. Among other works at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, a silver figure of St. John, a larger replica of which was afterwards made in clay, is certainly the work of Michelozzo alone, while others again are ascribed to him with more or less probability. In San Giorgio Maggiore, at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, there is still preserved a wooden crucifix by him. That Michelozzo was influenced by <a href="../cathen/05115d.htm">Donatello</a> in his plastic work, cannot be denied; but hs own style was not devoid of originality.

<p>As an architect, it is sufficient to say of him that he was certainly worthy to be compared with <a href="../cathen/03008c.htm">Brunelleschi</a>. Being court architect at Florence after 1435, he built the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in the church of Santa Croce and undertook the rebuilding of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of San Marco, in which the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> and the ball of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> are his work. He also built the fa&ccedil;ade of the church of Sant' Agostino in <a href="../cathen/10531a.htm">Montepulciano</a>. In these buildings he manifested a certain preference for antique forms, though there are also traces of the Gothic influence which was then passing away. Probably his greatest work was the palace of the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a> (afterwards in the possession of the Riccardi), which lost much of its fine balance of mass when it was enlarged. Between this edifice and <a href="../cathen/03008c.htm">Brunelleschi's</a> Pitti Palace there is a great resemblance, though the Pitti may be a work of later date. Still <a href="../cathen/03008c.htm">Brunelleschi</a> retains the superiority by virtue of his Palazzo di Parte Guelfa. A peculiarity of the Riccardi (<a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a>) Palace is the gradation of bossage from the base upwards through two stories, after which come smooth stone blocks. The plan, moreover, was afterwards generally imitated. Not very large, but imposing in effect, it presents, below, a <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">colonnade</a>, above, between bold <a href="../cathen/04379b.htm">cornices</a>, a wall decorated with antique reliefs, and then an upper story with semicircular, double-light, windows similar to those of the fa&ccedil;ade. The composite capital used here was afterwards generally adopted as a decorative element. To Michelozzo are also due a court in the Palazzo Vecchio and another in the Corsi Palace, as well as a palace built for the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a> in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, of which only a small part has been preserved. In this, as also in a palace at <a href="../cathen/12633c.htm">Ragusa</a> by the same master, the upper floor had windows with the pointed arches of an earlier style. At <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> his Portinari <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> is still to be seen in Sant' Eustorgio. As compared with <a href="../cathen/05115d.htm">Donatello</a> and <a href="../cathen/03008c.htm">Brunelleschi</a>, Michelozzo is given the higher place by some critics, though others rank him lower.
