<h1>Michiel Coxcie</h1>  

<p>Flemish <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, imitator of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, known as the <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>; b. at <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, 1499; d. there 1592. There are several spellings for his name: <em>Cocxie, Coxcie, Coxis, Coxcien, Coxcyen.</em> He was a pupil of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, and afterwards studied under <a href="../cathen/11320a.htm">Van Orley</a>, with whom he visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1532, where he made the acquaintance of <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a>. There he married his first wife, Ida van Hasselt, with whom he returned to <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, in 1539, and the same year became a member of the Academy of that place. In 1561 he was in <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, and after that back in <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, where, at the age of seventy, in 1569, he married his second wife, Jeanne van Schelle. By his first wife he had three children, Anne, a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, William, and Raphael, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>; by his second, two sons, Michiel, a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, and Conrad. Coxcie <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> several large works for the <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> and for Philip II, King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, to whom he was court <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>. He designed thirty-two subjects from the fable of Cupid and Psyche, which were engraved, and, in conjunction with <a href="../cathen/11320a.htm">Van Orley</a>, he directed the execution of some tapestry made from the designs of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>. He copied part of the great <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">Van Eyck</a> <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-piece</a> for <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a>, and portions of his copy are in <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> and <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> and the remainder in <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>. Several of his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> are to be seen at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, St. Petersburg, and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. In his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> he bestowed special care on the figures of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and they are well modelled and invariably graceful. In male figures he too often exaggerated the <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a> and selected awkward and unreasonable attitudes. His composition is very Italian in character, sometimes too academic in line and grouping, but agreeable in effect. His best works are signed and dated and are remarkable for their splendid colouring and harmonious result.
