<h1>Miecislas Halka Ledochowski</h1>  

<p>Count, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen-Posen</a>, b. at Gorki near Sandomir in Russian <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, 29 October, 1822; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 22 July, 1902. After studying at Radom and Warsaw, he entered the <em>Accademia dei Nobili Ecclesiastici</em> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1842, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 13 July, 1845. He became domestic <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1846, auditor of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> nunciature at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> in 1847, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a> to Colombia and <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a> in 1856, <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> and titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14562b.htm">Thebes</a> in 1861, and finally <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen-Posen</a> in December, 1865. He was <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a> on 8 January, 1866, and <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> on 22 April of the same year. Being on friendly terms with the King of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, he was sent to Versailles by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in November, 1870, to ask the services of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> for the re-establishment of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>, and to offer the services of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as mediator between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, but his mission <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> fruitless.

<p>Shortly after the outbreak of the German <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>,</em> the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government, without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or co-operation of Ledochowski, passed an ordinance that, after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1873, all religious instruction in Posen should be imparted in the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German language</a> only. It was but natural that the Polish people should object to such an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> ordinance, especially since most of the children were either entirely <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German language</a> or understood it only with difficulty. When the Government ignored the urgent request of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> to revoke the ordinance, he issued a circular on 22 February, 1873, to the teachers of religion at the higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> institutes, ordering them to use the vernacular in their religious instructions in the lower classes, but permitting the use of the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German language</a> in the higher classes, beginning with the <em>secunda.</em> <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> approved this act of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 24 March, 1873. All the teachers of religion were obedient to their <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and, in consequence, the Government deprived them of their positions. Religion being thus no longer taught at many institutions, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> erected private religious <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, but in an ordinance of 17 September, 1873, the Government forbade all pupils of the higher institutions to obtain religious instruction at those private <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. As all protests of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> useless, he disregarded the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> ordinances of the Government, and, after being fined repeatedly, he was finally ordered on 24 November, 1873, to present his resignation. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> answer was that no temporal court had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to deprive him of an office which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had imposed upon him through His visible representative on earth. Before he was formally deposed, he was arrested between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning of 3 February, 1874, and carried off to the dungeon of Ostrowo, because he refused to pay the repeated fines imposed upon him. While in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, he was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> on 13 March, 1874. The <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government declared him deposed on 15 April, 1874. On 3 February, 1876, he was released from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, but was ordered to leave <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. He continued to rule his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was sentenced to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for "arrogating episcopal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>" on three occasions, viz., 9 Feb. and 26 May, 1877, and 7 Nov., 1878. After being appointed secretary of <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Briefs</a> in 1885 he <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> resigned his archdiocese in the interests of peace. In 1892 he became Prefect of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, an office which he held until his death. An official reconciliation between the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government took place when Emperor William II visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1893.
