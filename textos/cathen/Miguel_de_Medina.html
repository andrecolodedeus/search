<h1>Miguel de Medina</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a>, born at Belalcazar, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 1489; died at Toledo, May, 1578. He entered the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> order in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of S. Maria de Angelis at Hornachuelos, in the Sierra Morena. After his profession he went to the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of SS. Peter and Paul at <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a>. He received the doctor's degree from the city of Toledo; and in 1550 he was unanimously elected to the chair of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">University of Alcal&aacute;</a>. In 1560 Philip II sent him to the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>; on his return he became superior of St. John's of the Kings at Toledo. In 1553 the "Commentaries" of <a href="../cathen/15621b.htm">John Ferus</a> were published in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> after a strict examination. Dominicus a Soto published at Salamanca a work censuring <a href="../cathen/15621b.htm">Ferus's</a> commentaries, selecting sixty-seven passages as deserving censure, and dedicated them to Vald&eacute;s, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>. Medina took up the defence of <a href="../cathen/15621b.htm">Ferus</a>, which was published at <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">Alcal&aacute;</a> (1567, 1578), and <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (1572). This literary controversy &#151; for no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> were entertained of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of Medina --agitated the Spanish people. A process was instituted against Medina in the tribunal of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> at Toledo. He was cast in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, where for more than five years he was subjected to great suffering and privations. His temporal afflictions and the rigour of his life brought on a severe illness and the inquisitor-general gave orders that Modina was to be conveyed to the Convent of St.John's of the Kings, where everything possible was to be done to preserve his life. Before the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, he made his profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, calling <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to witness that he never believed anything or taught anything opposed to the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> "the pillar and the ground of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>". His last words were: "In te Domine speravi non confundar in aeternum"

<p>Soon after his death, the supreme tribunal of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> declaring that the accusations brought against Medina were without foundation. His principal works are: "Christianae paraenesis sive de recta in Deum fide libri septem" (Venice, 1564); "Disputationes de indulgentiis adversus nostri temporis haereticos ad PP. s. Concilii Trident." (Venice, 1564); "De sacrorum hominum continentia libri V" (Venice, 1569j, written against those who advocated the necessity of permitting the German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to follow the example of the Greeks in this matter; "De igne purgatorio" (Venice, 1569), "De la verdadera y cristiana humilidad" (Toledo, 1559).
