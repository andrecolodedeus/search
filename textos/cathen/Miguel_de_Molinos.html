<h1>Miguel de Molinos</h1>  

<p>Founder of <a href="../cathen/12608c.htm">Quietism</a>, born at Muniesa, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 21 December, 1640; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 28 December, 1696. In his youth he went to <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, where, having been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and received the degree of doctor, he held a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> in the church of Santo Tomas and was confessor to a community of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. He pretended to be a disciple of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and quoted them as his authority in his differences with the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In 1662 he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> in the cause of the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> of Venerable Jer&oacute;nimo Sim&oacute;n. Here, after residing in various other places, he finally took up his abode at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of Sant' Alfonso which belonged to the Spanish Discalced Augustinians. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> having accused him of pernicious teachings, the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> ordered his books to be examined. He defended himself well and was acquitted; but again Cardinal d'Estr&eacute;es, French ambassador at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, acting on instructions from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, denounced him to the authorities In May, 1685, the Holy Office formulated charges against him and ordered his arrest. The report of the process was read on 3 September, 1687, in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, in the presence of an immense concourse of people gathered for the occasion by means of grants of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>; he was declared a dogmatic <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, sentenced to life <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, to be perpetually clothed in the penitential garb, to recite the Credo and one-third of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>, and to make confession four times every year. He received the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> on his death bed. He taught interior annihilation, asserting that this is the means of attaining purity of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, perfect contemplation, and the rich treasure of interior peace: hence follows the licitness of impure carnal acts, inasmuch as only the lower, sensual man, instigated by the demon, is concerned in them. In the cases of seventeen penitents he excused their lascivious acts, and claimed that those committed by himself were not blameworthy, as <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> had no part in them.

<p><a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Coelestis Pastor" (2 November, 1687), condemned as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, suspect, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>, <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a>, etc., sixty-eight propositions which Molinos admitted to be his, being convicted of having asserted them in speech and in writing, communicated them to others, and believed them--propositions which are not those of the "Gu&iacute;a Espiritual" alone. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> prohibited and condemned all his works, printed or in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>. Molinos had followers in abundance; when he was arrested, it is said that twelve thousand letters from <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who consulted him were found in his possession. More than two hundred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> found themselves implicated in the affair; several communities of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> practised the <a href="../cathen/12608b.htm">"prayer of quiet"</a>, while the inquisitorial proceedings in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> lasted until the eighteenth century. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11363a.htm">Oviedo</a>, taken to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the Castle of Sant' Angelo, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Juan de Causadas, and the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> Juan de Longas, who corrupted a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, were all punished as disciples of <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinism</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the semiquietism of <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a> and <a href="../cathen/07092b.htm">Jeanne Guyon</a> took from Molinos only the teaching of "pure <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>".

<p>Among the writings of Molinos may be mentioned the following: <ul><li>"La devoci&oacute;n de la buena muerte" (published at <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, 1662, under the name of Juan Bautista Catal&aacute;); <li>"La Gu&iacute;a espiritual" (published first in Italian, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1675, then, in Spanish at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 1676), approved by various <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, so much so that twenty editions appeared in twelve years, in Latin (1687), French, English (1685), German (1699), etc.; <li>"Tratado de la Comuni&oacute;n cuotidiana" (1687).</ul>
