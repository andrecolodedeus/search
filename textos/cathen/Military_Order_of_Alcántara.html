<h1>Military Order of Alc&aacute;ntara</h1>  

<p>Alc&aacute;ntara, a town on the Tagus (here crossed by a bridge--<em>cantara</em>, whence the name), is situated in the plain of Estremadura, a great field of conflict for the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in the twelfth century. First taken in 1167 by the King of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, Fernando II, Alc&aacute;ntara fell again (1172) into the hands of the fierce Jussuf, the third of the African Almohades; nor was it recovered until 1214, when it was taken by Alonzo of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, the son of Fernando. In order to defend this conquest, on a border exposed to many assaults, the king resorted to <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> neither standing armies nor garrisons, a deficiency that the <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a> supplied, combining as they did military training with monastic stability. Alc&aacute;ntara was first committed (1214) to the care of the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> Knights of Calatrava, who had lately given many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of their gallantry in the famous battle of Las Navas de Tolosas against the Almohades (1212). Alonzo of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a> wished to found at Al cantara a special branch of this celebrated order for his realm. But four years later these Knights felt that the post was too far from their <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> quarters. They give up the scheme and transferred the castle, with the permission of the king, to a peculiar Leonese order still in a formative stage, known as "Knights of St. Julian de Pereiro". Their genesis is obscure, but according to a somewhat questionable tradition, St. Julian de Pereiro was a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> of the country of Salamanca, where by his counsel, some <a href="../cathen/01695a.htm">knights</a> built a castle on the river Tagus to oppose the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>. They are mentioned in 1176, in a grant of King Fernando of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, but without allusion to their military character. They are first acknowledged as a <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military order</a> by a privilege of <a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Pope Celestine III</a> in 1197. Through their compact with the Knights of Calatrava, they accepted the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> rule and costume, a white mantle with the scarlet overcross, and they submitted to the right of introspection and correction from the Master of Calatrava. This union did not list long. The Knights of Alc&aacute;ntara, under their new name, acquired many castles and estates, for the most part at the expense of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>. They amassed great wealth from booty during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and from <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> donations. It was a turning point in their career. However, ambitions and dissensions increased among them. The post of grand master became the aim of rival aspirants. They employed against one another swords which had been vowed only to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">infidels</a>. In 1318, the castle of Alc&aacute;ntara presented the lamentable spectacle of the Grand Master, Ruy Vaz, besieged by his own Knights, sustained in this by the Grand Master of Calatrava. This rent in their body showed no less than three grand masters in contention, supported severally by the Knights, by the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, and by the king. Such instances show sufficiently to what a pass the monastic spirit had come. All that can be said in extenuation of such a <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> is that <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a> lost the chief object of their vocation when the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> were driven from their last foothold in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Some authors assign as causes of their disintegration the decimation of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> by the Black Death in the fourteenth century, and the laxity which recruited them from the most poorly qualified subjects. Lastly, there was the revolution in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a>, when the growth of modern artillery and infantry overpowered the armed cavalry of <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> times, the orders still holding to their obsolete mode of fighting. The orders, nevertheless, by their wealth and numerous vassals, remained a tremendous power in the kingdom, and before long were involved deeply in political agitations. During the fatal <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> between Peter the Cruel and his brother, Henry the Bastard, which divided half <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, the Knights of Alc&aacute;ntara were also split into two factions which warred upon each other.

<p>The kings, on their side, did not fail to take an active part in the election of the grand master, who could bring such valuable support to the royal authority. In 1409, the regent of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a> succeeded in having his son, Sancho, a boy of eight years, made Grand Master of Alcantara. These intrigues went on till 1492, when <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Pope Alexander VI</a> invested the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> King, Ferdinand of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, with the grand mastership of Alc&aacute;ntara for life. <a href="../cathen/01159b.htm">Adrian VI</a> went farther, in favour of his pupil, <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, for in 1522 he bestowed the three masterships of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> upon the Crown, even permitting their inheritance through the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> line. The Knights of Alc&aacute;ntara were released from the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in 1540, and the ties of common life were sundered. The order was reduced to a system of endowments at the disposal of the king, of which he availed to himself to reward his nobles. There were no less than thirty-seven "Commanderies", with fifty-three castles or villages. Under the French domination the revenues of Alc&aacute;ntara were confiscated, in 1808, and they were only partly given back in 1814, after the restoration of Ferdinand VII. They disappeared finally during the subsequent Spanish revolutions, and since 1875 the Order of Alc&aacute;ntara is only a personal decoration, conferred by the king for military services. See <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">MILITARY ORDERS</a>.
