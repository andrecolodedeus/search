<h1>Military Orders of St. Hubert</h1>  

<p>I. The highest order of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, founded in 1444 or 1445 by Gerhard V, Duke of J&uuml;lich, in commemoration of a victory gained on <a href="../cathen/07507a.htm">St. Hubert's</a> day (3 Nov.); some, however, date the establishment as late as 1473 and 1475. After being held by collateral branches of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and passing through many political changes, the Duchy of J&uuml;lich, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, was under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Electoral Prince Johann Wilhelm, Duke of Neuberg. In 1708 he restored the Order of <a href="../cathen/07507a.htm">St. Hubert</a>, which has fallen into desuetude, vesting the grandmastership in his own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and conferred the cross of the order on a number of his courtiers, together with generous pensions, on condition that the tenth part of these monies be set aside for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and a goodly sum be distributed on the day of their reception into the order. The order was confirmed (30 March, 1800), by Maximilian, King of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, who stipulated that each capitular should have filled for at least six years the post of commander in the Order of the Crown of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, which he himself had instituted. The chapter was assigned for 12 October, and the number of capitulars fixed at twelve. According to Schoonebeck the original collar of the order was composed of small horns obtained in the chase; later it was of gold, the forty-two links bearing alternately the representation of the conversion of <a href="../cathen/07507a.htm">St. Hubert</a> and I. T. V., the initials of the device of the order. The cross is of gold enamelled in white and surmounted by a crown; on one side is represented the conversion of <a href="../cathen/07507a.htm">St. Hubert</a>, with the Gothic legend <em>In traw vast</em> (firm in fidelity); on the other the imperial orb and the inscription <em>In memoriam recuperat&aelig; dignitatis avit&aelig; 1708</em>.

<p>II. An order instituted in 1416 under the name of the Order of Fidelity by the principal lords of the Duchy of Bar, for the purpose of putting an end to the perpetual conflicts between the Duchies of Bar and Lorraine, and uniting them under Ren&eacute; of Anjou. The order, which was to last for five years, was made perpetual in 1422 and placed under the patronage of <a href="../cathen/07507a.htm">St. Hubert</a>. On the cession of the Duchies of Bar and Lorraine to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Louis XV confirmed the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> in their ancient privileges. During the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> the order was maintained at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, but was reorganized in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1815, and formally recognized by Louis XVIII the following year. It did not survive the Revolution of 1830. The cross of the order bore on one side the image of <a href="../cathen/07507a.htm">St. Hubert</a> kneeling before a cross visible between the horns of a stag; and on the other the insignia of the Duchy of Bar, with the inscription: Ordo nobilis s. Huberti Barensis, institutus anno 1416.
