<h1>Millennium and Millenarianism</h1>  

<p>The fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of millenarianism, as understood by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers, may be set forth as follows: At the end of time Christ will return in all His splendour to gather together the just, to annihilate hostile powers, and to found a glorious kingdom on earth for the enjoyment of the highest spiritual and material <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>; He Himself will reign as its king, and all the just, including the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> recalled to life, will participate in it. At the close of this kingdom the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> will enter <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> with Christ, while the wicked, who have also been resuscitated, will be condemned to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a>. The duration of this glorious reign of Christ and His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> on earth, is frequently given as one thousand years. Hence it is commonly known as the "millennium", while the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the future realization of the kingdom is called "millenarianism" (or "chiliasm", from the Greek <em>chilia</em>, scil. <em>ete</em>).

<p>This term of one thousand years, however, is by no means an essential element of the millennium as conceived by its adherents. The extent, details of the realization, conditions, the place, of the millennium were variously described. Essential are the following points: <ul><li>the early return of Christ in all His power and glory, <li>the establishment of an earthly kingdom with the just, <li>the resuscitation of the deceased <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and their participation in the glorious reign, <li>the destruction of the powers hostile to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, <li>at the end of the kingdom, the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">universal resurrection</a> with the final judgment, after which the just will enter <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, while the wicked will be consigned to the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire of hell</a>.</ul>

<p>The roots of the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in a glorious kingdom, partly natural, partly <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, are found in the hopes of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for a temporal <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a> and in the Jewish apocalyptic. Under the galling pressure of their political circumstances the expectation of a <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a> who would free the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had in the Jewish mind, assumed a character that was to a great extent earthly; the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> longed above all for a saviour who would free them from their oppressors and restore the former splendour of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. These expectations generally included the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jehovah</a> would conquer all powers hostile to Himself and to His chosen people, and that He would set up a final, glorious kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. The apocalyptic books, principally the book of Henoch and the fourth book of Esdras, indicate various details of the arrival of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a>, the defeat of the nations hostile to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and the union of all the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Messianic kingdom</a> followed by the renovation of the world and the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">universal resurrection</a>.

<p>The natural and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> are mingled in this conception of a <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Messianic kingdom</a> as the closing act of the world's history. The Jewish hopes of a <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a>, and the descriptions of apocalyptic writers were blended; it was between the close of the present world-order and the commencement of the new that this sublime kingdom of the chosen people was to find its place. That many details of these conceptions should remain indistinct and confused was but natural, but the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Messianic kingdom</a> is always pictured as something <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>, though the colours are at times earthly and sensuous. The evangelical accounts clearly prove how fervently the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at the time of Christ expected an earthly <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Messianic kingdom</a>, but the Saviour came to proclaim the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">spiritual kingdom of God</a> for the deliverance of man from his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and for his sanctification, a kingdom which actually began with His birth. There is no trace of chiliasm to be found in the Gospels or in the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>; everything moves in the spiritual and religious sphere; even the descriptions of the end of the world and of the last judgment bear this stamp. The victory over the symbolical beast (the enemy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>) and over <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, as well as the triumph of Christ and His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, are described in the Apocalypse of St. John (<a href="../bible/rev020.htm">Revelation 20</a>-<a href="../bible/rev021.htm">21</a>), in pictures that resemble those of the Jewish apocalyptic writers, especially of Daniel and Henoch. <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> is chained in the abyss for a thousand years, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and the just rise from the dead and share in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and kingship of Christ. Though it is difficult to focus sharply the pictures used in the Apocalypse and the things expressed by them, yet there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the whole description refers to the spiritual combat between <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on the one hand and the malignant powers of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and the world on the other. Nevertheless, a large number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the post-Apostolic era, particularly in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, yielded so far to Jewish apocalyptic as to put a literal meaning into these descriptions of St. John's Apocalypse; the result was that millenarianism spread and gained staunch advocates not only among the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> but among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> as well.

<p>One of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>, who flourished towards the end of the first century, proclaimed a splendid <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of Christ</a> on earth which He would establish with the risen <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> upon His second advent, and pictured the pleasures of this one thousand years in gross, sensual colours (Caius in Eusebius, <a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.28</a>; Dionysius Alex. in Eusebius, ibid., VII, 25). Later among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, Bishop Papias of Hierapolis, a disciple of St. John, appeared as an advocate of millenarianism. He claimed to have received his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> from contemporaries of the Apostles, and <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> narrates that other "Presbyteri", who had seen and heard the disciple John, learned from him the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in millenarianism as part of the Lord's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. According to <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.39</a>) Papias in his book asserted that the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a> would be followed by one thousand years of a visible glorious earthly <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of Christ</a>, and according to <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (Adv. Haereses, V, 33), he taught that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> too would enjoy a superabundance of earthly pleasures. There will be days in which vines will grow, each with 10,000 branches, and on each branch 10,000 twigs, and on each twig 10,000 shoots, and in each shoot 10,000 clusters, and on each cluster 10,000 grapes, and each grape will produce 216 gallons of wine etc.



<p>Millenarian <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are found by most commentators in the Epistle of St. Barnabas, in the passage treating of the Jewish <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>; for the resting of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on the seventh day after the creation is explained in the following manner. After the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> has come and put an end to the era of the wicked and judged them, and after the sun, the moon, and the stars have been changed, then He will rest in glory on the seventh day. The author had premised, if it is said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> created all things in six days, this means that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will complete all things in six millenniums, for one day represents one thousand years. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the writer advocates the tenet of a re-formation of the world through the second advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but it is not clear from the indications whether the author of the letter was a millenarian in the strict sense of the word. St. Iren&aelig;us of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, a native of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, influenced by the companions of <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a>, adopted millenarian <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, discussing and defending them in his works against the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> (Adv. Haereses, V, 32). He developed this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> mainly in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, who rejected all hopes of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> future life, and discerned in the glorious <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of Christ</a> on earth principally the prelude to the final, spiritual <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, the realm of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal bliss</a>. <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin of Rome</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, opposes to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in his Dialogue with Tryphon (ch. 80-1) the tenet of a millennium and asserts that he and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> whose <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is correct in every point <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there will be a <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a> and that the newly built and enlarged <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> will last for the space of a thousand years, but he adds that there are many who, though adhering to the pure and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> teachings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in it. A witness for the continued <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in millenarianism in the province of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> is <a href="../cathen/10166b.htm">St. Melito</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13472a.htm">Sardes</a> in the second century. He develops the same train of thought as did St. Iren&aelig;us.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanistic movement</a> had its origin in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. The expectation of an early advent of the celestial <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> upon earth, which, it was thought, would appear in Phrygia, was intimately joined in the minds of the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the millennium. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, the protagonist of <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanism</a>, expounds the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> (in his work now lost, "De Spe Fidelium" and in "Adv. Marcionem", IV) that at the end of time the great Kingdom of promise, the new <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, would be established and last for the space of one thousand years. All these millenarian authors appeal to various passages in the prophetic books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, to a few passages in the Letters of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and to the Apocalypse of St. John. Though millenarianism had found numerous adherents among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and had been upheld by several <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, neither in the post-Apostolic period nor in the course of the second century, does it appear as a universal <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or as a part of the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Apostolic tradition</a>. The primitive Apostolic symbol mentions indeed the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a> and the return of Christ to judge the living and the dead, but it says not a word of the millennium. It was the second century that produced not only defenders of the millennium but pronounced adversaries of the chiliastic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnosticism</a> rejected millenarianism. In <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, the principal seat of millenarian teachings, the so-called <a href="../cathen/01331b.htm">Alogi</a> rose up against millenarianism as well as against <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanism</a>, but they went too far in their opposition, rejecting not only the Apocalypse of St. John, alleging <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a> as its author, but his Gospel also. The opposition to millenarianism became more general towards the end of the second century, going hand in hand with the struggle against <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanism</a>. The Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Caius (end of the second and beginning of the third century) attacked the millenarians. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus of Rome</a> defended them and attempted a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, basing his arguments on the allegorical explanation of the six days of creation as six thousand years, as he had been taught by tradition.

<p>The most powerful adversary of millenarianism was <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen of Alexandria</a>. In view of the <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">Neo-Platonism</a> on which his doctrines were founded and of his spiritual-allegorical method of explaining the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, he could not side with the millenarians. He combatted them expressly, and, owing to the great influence which his writings exerted on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> especially in Oriental countries, millenarianism gradually disappeared from the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Christians</a>. Only a few later advocates are known to us, principally <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> adversaries of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. About the middle of the third century, Nepos, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, who entered the lists against the allegorism of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, also propounded millenarian <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and gained some adherents in the vicinity of Arsino . A <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> threatened; but the prudent and moderate policy of Dionysius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, preserved unity; the chiliasts abandoned their views (Eusebius, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.14</a>). <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> seems to have harboured adherents of millenarianism in still later times Methodius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11249a.htm">Olympus</a>, one of the principal opponents of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> at the beginning of the fourth century, upheld chiliasm in his Symposion (IX, 1, 5). In the second half of the fourth century, these doctrines found their last defender in Apollinaris, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> and founder of Apollinarism (q.v.). His writings on this subject, have been lost; but <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil of Caesarea</a> (Epist. CCLXIII, 4), Epiphanius (Haeres. LXX, 36) and Jerome (In Isai. XVIII) testify to his having been a chiliast. Jerome also adds that many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of that time shared the same <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>; but after that millenarianism found no outspoken champion among the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>.

<p>In the West, the millenarian expectations of a glorious <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of Christ</a> and His just, found adherents for a long time. The poet Commodian (Instructiones, 41, 42, 44) as well as Lactantius (Institutiones, VII) proclaim the millennial realm and describe its splendour, partly drawing on the earlier chiliasts and the Sybilline prophecies, partly borrowing their colours from the "golden age" of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> poets; but the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the six thousand years for the duration of the world is ever conspicuous. <a href="../cathen/15414a.htm">Victorinus of Pettau</a> also was a millenarian though in the extant copy of his commentary on the Apocalypse no allusions to it can be detected. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, himself a decided opponent of the millennial <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, brands Sulpicius Severus as adhering to them, but in the writings of this author in their present form nothing can be found to support this charge. <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> indeed teaches a twofold <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, but millenarian doctrines do not stand out clearly. On the other hand; St. Augustine was for a time, as he himself testifies (<a href="../fathers/120120.htm"><em>City of God</em> XX.7</a>), a pronounced champion of millenarianism; but he places the millennium after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">universal resurrection</a> and regards it in a more spiritual light (Sermo, CCLIX). When, however, he accepted the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of only one <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">universal resurrection</a> and a final judgment immediately following, he could no longer cling to the principal tenet of early chiliasm. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> finally held to the conviction that there will be no millennium. The struggle between Christ and His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> on the one hand and the wicked world and <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> on the other, is waged in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on earth; so the great Doctor describes it in his work <a href="../fathers/1201.htm"><em>De Civitate Dei</em></a>. In the same book he gives us an allegorical explanation of Chapter 20 of the Apocalypse. The first resurrection, of which this chapter treats, he tells us, refers to the spiritual rebirth in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> of one thousand years after the six thousand years of history is the whole of eternal life &#151; or in other words, the number one thousand is intended to express perfection, and the last space of one thousand years must be understood as referring to the end of the world; at all events, the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of Christ</a>, of which the Apocalypse speaks, can only be applied to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (<a href="../fathers/120120.htm"><em>City of God</em> XX.5-7</a>). This explanation of the illustrious Doctor was adopted by succeeding Western <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, and millenarianism in its earlier shape no longer received support. <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a> are mentioned in later writings against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> as defenders of the millennium, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but as cut-off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Moreover, the attitude of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> towards the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> had undergone a change with closer connection between her and the Roman empire. There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that this turn of events did much towards weaning the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from the old millenarianism, which during the time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> had been the expression of their hopes that Christ would soon reappear and overthrow the foes of His elect. Chiliastic views disappeared all the more rapidly, because, as was remarked above, in spite of their wide diffusion even among sincere <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and in spite of their defence by prominent Fathers of the early Church, millenarianism was never held in the universal Church as an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a> based on Apostolic traditions.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> were never tainted with millenarianism; it was foreign both to the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of that period and to the religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the people. The fantastic views of the apocalyptic writers (<a href="../cathen/08406c.htm">Joachim of Floris</a>, the Franciscan-Spirituals, the Apostolici), referred only to a particular form of spiritual renovation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but did not include a second advent of Christ. The "emperor myths," which prophesied the establishment of a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, universal kingdom by the great emperor of the future, contain indeed descriptions that remind one of the ancient Sybilline and millenarian writings, but an essential trait is again missing, the return of Christ and the connection of the blissful reign with the resurrection of the just. Hence the millennium proper is unknown to them. The <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> of the sixteenth century ushered in a new epoch of millenarian doctrines. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> fanatics of the earlier years, particularly the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a>, believed in a new, golden age under the sceptre of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, after the overthrow of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and secular empires. In 1534 the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> set up in M&uuml;nster (Westphalia) the new Kingdom of Zion, which advocated sharing <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in common, as a prelude to the new <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of Christ</a>. Their excesses were opposed and their millenarianism disowned by both the Augsberg (art. 17) and the Helvetian Confession (ch. 11), so that it found no admission into the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> and Reformed theologies. Nevertheless, the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries produced new apocalyptic fanatics and mystics who expected the millennium in one form or another: in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> and Moravian Brethren (Comenius); in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Pierre Jurien (L'Accomplissement des Propheties, 1686); in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> at the time of Cromwell, the Independents and Jane Leade. A new phase in the development of millenarian views among the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> commenced with <a href="../cathen/12080c.htm">Pietism</a>. One of the chief champions of the millennium in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> was I.A. Bengel and his disciple Crusius, who were afterwards joined by <a href="../cathen/13207a.htm">Rothe</a>, Volch, Thiersch, Lange and others. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> from Wurtemberg <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to Palestine (Temple Communities) in order to be closer to Christ at His second advent. Certain fantastical <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and North America, such as the <a href="../cathen/08174a.htm">Irvingites</a>, <a href="../cathen/10570c.htm">Mormons</a>, <a href="../cathen/01166a.htm">Adventists</a>, adopted both apocalyptic and millenarian views, expecting the return of Christ and the establishment of His kingdom at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. Some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the nineteenth century championed a moderate, modified millenarianism, especially in connection with their explanations of the Apocalypse; as Pagani (The End of the World, 1856), Schneider (Die chiliastische Doktrin, 1859), Rohling (Erkl&auml;rung der Apokalypse des hl. Iohannes, 1895; Auf nach Sion, 1901), Rougeyron Chabauty (Avenir de l'&Eacute;glise catholique selon le Plan Divin, 1890).
