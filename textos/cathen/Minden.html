<h1>Minden</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of Minden (former <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>).

<p>Minden on the Weser is first heard of in 798, and in 803 in the Treaty of Salz, made with the Saxons, it is spoken of as a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Erkambert (Herumbert), probably a Saxon, who was appointed in 780 and died in 813. The third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Dietrich I (853-80) fell in battle against the <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Northmen</a>: the fifth, Drogo (887-902), founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at M&ouml;llenbeck. The diocese gradually developed until it extended on the east across the Aller to Celle, on the west to Hunte, embracing the districts of Lidbekegowe, Enterigowe, Loingo, Merstem, Buki, and Tilithi. From the beginning the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Minden were suffragans of Cologne. The later estates of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> comprised about a fourth of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; it extended from Porta Westfalica, on both sides of the river, to Schl&uuml;sselburg, and on the north-west across to Hunte. The most important places were Minden, L&uuml;bbecke, Petershagen, Schl&uuml;sselburg, Reineberg, and Rahden. The see suffered in the tenth century from the Hungarians, but began to flourish under the Saxon dynasty.

<p>Bishop Landward (956-69) obtained from <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> immunity from all foreign <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and also obtained the revenues derived from the administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; Milo (969-96) on account of his loyalty to <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> received important privileges, among others the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to elect the bailiff who represented the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the imperial court, in 977 penal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, the Weser toll, the right of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a> and of conducting a cattle market. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> became so important that he was almost an independent prince. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canons obtained in 961 the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to choose the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, provided a worthy man was chosen. Bishops Dietrich II (1002-22), Sigebert (1022-36), and Bruno (1037-55) were in the emperor's favour and consequently added to their <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. During the reign of Henry IV the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were caught in the Investitures conflict, and more than once <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> and imperial sympathizers contended for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. After the Concordat of Worms the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> under Sigward (1120-40) and Heinrich I (1140-53) made great strides. Werner (1153-70) and Anno (1170-85) guided the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> safely through the struggle between <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a> and the Saxon Duke Henry the Lion. The episcopal dependence on the ducal power, and the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of Minden were henceforth subject to the emperor.

<p>Continuous conflict with encroaching nobles brought a load of <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> and forced many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to pledge or sell the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> estates. The town of Minden profited by the financial embarrassment of its episcopal lords, gradually acquired more <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, and partially freed itself from the overlordship of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; on the other hand, the authority of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was restricted by the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter which, in Minden as in other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, acquired the right of choosing the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and dean and made all important matters of administration subject to its consent. Bishop Gottfried von Waldeck (1304-24), to evade the oppression of the burgesses, moved his residence to the castle of Petershagen. With the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of Louis of Brunswick (1324-46) began the unedifying and detrimental series of conflicts between <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and chapter as to the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Louis involved the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in the feuds of neighbouring nobles. The town acquired the administration of Justice, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to levy customs <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, and the right of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a>. Some energetic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> followed: Gerhard I (1346-53); Gerhard II von Schauenburg (1361-66); Wedekind vom Berge (1369-83); <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> (1384-97.

<p>In the fifteenth century more than one double election took place. Wulbrand, Count of Hallermund (1406-36), endeavoured to bring order out of confusion; his successor, Albert II von Hoya, as coadjutor and as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1436-73), was involved in a long dispute with Osnabr&uuml;ck and the Duke of Brunswick. His successor, Heinrich III von Schauenburg (1473-1508), sought better relations with his neighbours, but episcopal authority was so weakened that a return to former conditions was impossible. The power of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was now so restricted by the chapter and the town, that he was unable to take any important step; without their consent; indeed a complete co-regency of the chapter was set up. Almost all the castles were in the hands of the aristocratic canons, and the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> were extremely limited. The lives of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> did not in many cases conform to the canonical rules; <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a> was quite general, monastic discipline had relaxed, and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> had grown cold. For these reasons the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> spread rapidly in the town and the diocese under Bishop Franz I of Brunswick-Wolfenb&uuml;ttel (1508-29), who involved the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in the Hildersheim chapter feuds, and died as the result of his excesses. His successor, Franz II von Waldeck, also <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a> and Osnabr&uuml;ck from 1532, led a dissolute life, and was an adherent of the new religious teachings, which he privately furthered with all his power. In 1553 he was forced to resign in favour of Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenb&uuml;ttel (1553-54), who soon resigned in favour of his uncle, Georg (1554-66).

<p>Under his successor Hermann von Schauenberg (1567-82), <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> spread rapidly; Hermann accepted the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but governed as a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> prince. Heinrich Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel (1582-85) declared the Confession of Augsburg the only authorized creed in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Otto von Schaunberg (1587-99) was a devoted <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, but, owing to disputes with the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter and the estates, accomplished little for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. The last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> but one, Christian of Brunswick (1599-1633, a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>), troubled himself little about his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and ruled it from his paternal estates. By the terms of his election he had to allow the free exercise of both creeds. The attempt of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter to turn over the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John at Minden to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (1604) was frustrated by the opposition of the citizens. By the Edict of Restitution (1629) the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Minden obtained the churches of St. Martin and St. Simeon; the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> in 1630 established themselves in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> until 1651, and even the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, though for only a short time, were welcomed to the city. Franz von Wartenberg (1633-48), last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Minden, endeavoured to restore the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in his Sees of Minden, <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, and Verden; but in 1633 he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee before the Swedes, and after the Treaty of Prague (1635) was unable to return.

<p>By the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was suppressed, Franz Wilhelm retained the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Minden, but its temporal possessions, embracing more than twenty-two square miles, were awarded to the Electorate of Brandenburg. It was only in 1649 that <a href="../cathen/02738c.htm">Brandenburg</a> was able to obtain possession; in 1650 the Elector Frederick William received the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance from the town and the nobility at the episcopal castle of Petershagen. The "principality" of Minden remained at first a special <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, until in 1729 it was united to the Countship of Ravensberg. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> retained only the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> with eleven <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonries</a>, all of which were suppressed early in the nineteenth century; but the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is still in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> hands. After the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, its territory was administered for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> purposes by the Northern Mission. In 1821 most of it fell to <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, and a small remnant to Hildesheim.
