<h1>Minor</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>minor</em>), that which is less, or inferior in comparison with another, the term being employed as well of things as of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. To glance rapidly at its application to things, we may mention <em>causae minors</em>, matters of lesser importance, as opposed to <em>causae majores</em>, those more important; minor <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> as opposed to the major <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, which imply <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and are confirmed in <a href="../cathen/04285a.htm">papal consistory</a>; minor churches or those of inferior rank; the minor <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> (now out of use), as opposed to the major <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. In reference to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, certain uses of the word minor may also be mentioned which depend upon usage rather than upon law: the younger of two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the same name is sometimes called minor (or "the less") as St. James the Less. Through <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a> gave his religious the name of "Friars Minor", that is, less than other <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>.

<p>But in its most frequent and most strictly judicial acceptation, the word designates a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who, having passed his infancy, has not yet reached the age required by law for the performance of certain acts of the exercise of certain <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>; in practice the utmost limit is considered, and beyond it there exists no restriction; those are called minors who have not yet reached the age at which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> makes them capable of performing all civil acts whatever, especially the administration of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. This age being fixed by most modern <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> at twenty-one years, everyone is a minor until the age of majority. As the matter is primarily one of civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> leaves distinctions to the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. In what concerns canon law and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> acts, no uniform limit of minority has ever been established; for given acts and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> the canon law and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> usage have established the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and sufficient age. In the first place children are not considered as minors; it is presumed that until the age of reason, legally fixed at seven years, a child possesses neither the intelligence nor the experience to commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or to exercise any <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> whatsoever. When no longer a child a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> becomes a minor. Minors are either under or over the age of puberty, which is fixed by the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> at fourteen full years for boys and twelve full years for girls; between the age of seven years and that of puberty they are said to be nearer, or less near to infancy or puberty, as the case may be. For those under puberty, there begins with the age of reason the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of observing the moral law and those <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from which they are not exempt by their age, notably the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to receive the Sacraments; such minors therefore are capable of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> although their responsibility is less in proportion as they are nearer childhood; for this reason they are not liable to the penalties of the <em>forum externum</em>, except where this is specially provided. It is presumed that with puberty the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> begins to enjoy the plentitude of his intelligence and liberty in spiritual matters and purely personal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>: the minor of the age of puberty can contract marriage, he can receive <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> and be nominated to and administrate a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> (Conc. Trid., Sess. XXII, c. vi, "De ref."; c. iii, "De judic." in 6). There are, however, acts binding his future which he cannot perform until at a more advanced age; he cannot make a <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> until the age of sixteen is completed (Conc. Trid., Sess. XXV. "De regular", c. xv); he cannot receive the sub-diaconate before his twenty-first year (Sess. XXIII. c. vii). At the age of twenty-one, too, he begins to be subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. (For more ample developments see Age, Canonical.)

<p>A leading characteristic in all legislation on minors is the protection afforded them in regard to the administration of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> which they can assume in reference to third parties. As a general rule the liberty of minors is unrestrained as to contracts which are to their advantage, but they cannot make any contracts which are burdensome to themselves except under certain determined formalities, and with the required authorization. Still more, if they consider themselves as suffering by such contracts they may, by the terms of the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman Law</a> ("De minorib., xxv, ann." ff., IV, iv), for four years after their majority of twenty-five years, obtain the "restitutio in integrum", i.e. a judicial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> restored the condition of things which existed before the contract by which the minor suffered. These provisions have been more or less completely embodied in the modern <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of various countries, the discussion of which would be out of place here. It is enough to say that the canon law has accepted them (Decret., lib. I, tit. xli, "De in integrum restitutione"), and applied them to churches and other juridical entities which it was expedient to protect against maladministration. When it is said that churches are assimilated to minors (c. vii, 3, 8, "De in integrum restit.") the meaning is that, in respect to burdensome contracts, churches and other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> establishments are subject to the same protective measures, and enjoy the same privileges, as minors.
