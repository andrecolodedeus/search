<h1>Minor Orders</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>Ordines Minores</em>).

<p>The lower degrees of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> are designated by the name of minor orders, in opposition to the "major" or "sacred" orders. At the present time the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are entered by the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>, after which all the orders without omission are received in succession. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, as a general rule, no longer remain in the lower orders, the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> functions of which are discharged either by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the higher orders, as in <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcism</a>, or by the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, as in singing and serving at the altar. Formerly one entered the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> by being appointed to discharge any of the functions reserved to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. Such functions were of two kinds. The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> ones constituted orders, though of a lower rank; by <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> the recipients of the minor orders received official authority to perform these functions. The other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions were rather offices, entrusted to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> or not. Thus in the first centuries there figured in the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> notaries, <em>defensores ecclesiae, oeconomi</em>, catechists, cantors, <em>fossores</em> (for the cemeteries), etc., to say nothing of <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>. But these various offices did not constitute orders, and those who filled them formed part of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> without having been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, like <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsured</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and lay-brothers of today. As to the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> functions attached to the various minor orders, they are really but a participation, originally rather indefinite, in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> ministry formerly confided entirely to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. This explains why minor orders differ in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> and in the various <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a>.

<p>In the East, though at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> we hear of porters and <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcists</a> (never of <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>), after the Trullan Synod in 692, in accordance with its sixth canon, only <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a> and cantors are known, and often even these orders coalesce, or are conferred at the same time; the three other minor orders of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> (porter, <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcist</a>, <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a>) are held to be included in the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a>. In the East, moreover, the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> has remained a minor order; in the West it was gradually detached from the minor orders, on account of its higher <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> functions and also because of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> it called for. Finally, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> definitively included it in the major orders, and made the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, as well as the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, eligible for the episcopate (c. 9, "De aetate et qualit., " I, tit. 14, an. 1207). There are, then, in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> four minor orders: porter, <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a>, <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcist</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a>; the cantors merely exercise an office and are not an order. These four orders are all mentioned about the year 252 in the famous letter of <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Pope Cornelius</a> to Fabius of Antioch (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250101.htm"><em>Church History</em> I.6.43</a>): "He (Novatian) <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that there were in this Church (of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>) 46 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 7 <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, 7 <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, 42 <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>, and 52 <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcists</a>, <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a>, and porters." This quotation shows that besides the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>, who were enumerated separately and were at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> almost assimilated with the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, there was a kind of indefinite class formed by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of the three latter orders. This seems to indicate that all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> did not necessarily pass through the four lower orders; as a matter of fact the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> (can. xiii) mentions only the lectorate as <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> before receiving the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a>. <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">Pope Siricius</a> (Ad Himerium, nn. 9-10) and <a href="../cathen/15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a> (Ad Hesychium, nn. 1 and 3) describe for us the ordinary career of Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>: from boyhood or youth they are <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a>; about the age of twenty, <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> or <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>; those who enter the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> when already grown up are first <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcists</a> or <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a>, after a certain time <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> or <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>. Briefly, it appears that the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of receiving all the minor orders without exception is a law <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the time when the minor orders ceased to be exercised in the original way. Moreover, there is no longer any fixed age at which the minor orders may be received. Canon law is silent on the subject. Canonists, including <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (Constitution, "Eo quamvis," 4 May, 1745), admit that minor orders may be conferred not only on those who have reached the age of puberty, but on boys over seven years. In fact, minor orders are usually conferred on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students during their <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> studies. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> requires merely that the candidates understand Latin (Sess. XXIII, e. xii).

<p>Although several <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> regarded minor orders as sacramental, this view is no longer held, for the fundamental reason that minor orders, also the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a>, are not of Divine or Apostolic origin. The rites by which they are conferred are quite different from <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to holy orders. Minor orders are conferred by the presentation to the candidate of the appropriate instruments, in accordance with the ritual given in the "Statuta Ecclesiae antiqua," a document which originated in Gaul about the year 500. We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how even in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the porters and <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcists</a> were <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in former times. Lectors received a simple benediction; <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> were created by handing them the linen bag in which they carried the Eucharist; <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> by the reception of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>. Moreover, while <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> could be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> only on the four Ember Saturdays and on two Saturdays in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, minor orders could be conferred on any day. Even at the present time the latter may be conferred, apart from general ordinations, on all <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and on Holy Days of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, not necessarily at Mass. The usual minister of these orders as of the others, is a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; but regular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> who have received episcopal benediction may give the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> and minor orders to their subjects in religion. By <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> privilege several <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> <em>Nullius</em> (i.e., exempt) can confer these orders. It is an almost universal custom now to confer the four minor orders at, one time, and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (loc. cit.) leaves the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> quite free to dispense with the interstices (q.v.).

<p>Clerics in minor orders enjoy all <a href="../cathen/12437a.htm">ecclesiastical privileges</a>. They may be nominated to all <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> not major, but must receive within a year the major orders <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for certain <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. On the other hand, they are not bound to <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a>, and may lawfully marry. Marriage, however, causes them at once to forfeit every <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. Formerly it did not exclude them from the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and they retained all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> privileges, provided they contracted only one marriage and that with a virgin, and wore <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> costume and the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> (c.unic., "de cler. conjug." in VI); they might even be appointed to the service of a church by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Conc. Trid., Sess. XXIII, c. vi). This earlier discipline, however, is no longer in accordance with modern custom and law. A minor cleric who marries is regarded as having forfeited his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> privileges. (See ORDERS; <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">ACOLYTE</a>; <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">EXORCIST</a>; <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">LECTOR</a>; <a href="../cathen/12284b.htm">PORTER</a>; <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">SUBDEACON</a>; <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">ABBOT</a>; <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">TONSURE</a>.)
