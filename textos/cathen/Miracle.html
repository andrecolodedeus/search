<h1>Miracle</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>miraculum</em>, from <em>mirari</em>, "to wonder").

<p>In general, a wonderful thing, the word being so used in classical Latin; in a specific sense, the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Latin Vulgate</a> designates by <em>miracula</em> wonders of a peculiar kind, expressed more clearly in the Greek text by the terms <em>terata</em>, <em>dynameis</em>, <em>semeia</em>, i.e., wonders performed by <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> power as signs of some special mission or gift and explicitly ascribed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>These terms are used habitually in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and express the meaning of <em>miraculum</em> of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. Thus St. Peter in his first sermon speaks of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as approved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>dynamesin, kai terasin kai semeiois</em> (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs22">Acts 2:22</a>) and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> says that the signs of his <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostleship</a> were wrought, <em>semeiois te kai terasin kai dynamesin</em> (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#vrs12">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>). Their united meaning is found in the term <em>erga</em> i.e., works, the word constantly employed in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> to designate the miracles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01450a.htm">analysis</a> of these terms therefore gives the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and scope of the miracle.
<h2 id="section1">Nature</h2>

<p>(1) The word <em>terata</em> literally means "wonders", in reference to feelings of amazement excited by their occurrence, hence effects produced in the material creation appealing to, and grasped by, the senses, usually by the sense of sight, at times by hearing, e.g., the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. Thus, though the works of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>, such as the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Sacramental Presence</a>, are above the power of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone, they may be called miraculous only in the wide meaning of the term, i.e., as <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> effects, but they are not miracles in the sense here understood, for miracles in the strict sense are apparent. The miracle falls under the grasp of the senses, either in the work itself (e.g. raising the dead to <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>) or in its effects (e.g., the gifts of infused <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>). In like manner the <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in itself is miraculous, but is not a miracle properly so called, unless it takes place in a sensible manner, as, e.g., in the case of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>.

<p>The wonder of the miracle is due to the fact that its cause is hidden, and an effect is expected other than what actually takes place. Hence, by comparison with the ordinary course of things, the miracle is called extraordinary. In analyzing the difference between the extraordinary character of the miracle and the ordinary course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> employ the terms <em>above, contrary to</em>, and <em>outside</em> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. These terms express the manner in which the miracle is extraordinary.

<p>A miracle is said to be above <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> when the effect produced is above the native powers and forces in creatures of which the known <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are the expression, as raising a dead man to <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, e.g., <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> (<a href="../bible/joh011.htm">John 11</a>), the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> son (<a href="../bible/1ki017.htm">1 Kings 17</a>). A miracle is said to be outside, or beside, <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> when natural forces may have the power to produce the effect, at least in part, but could not of themselves alone have produced it in the way it was actually brought about. Thus the effect in abundance far exceeds the power of natural forces, or it takes place instantaneously without the means or processes which <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> employs. In illustration we have the multiplication of loaves by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm">John 6</a>), the changing of water into wine at <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> (<a href="../bible/joh002.htm">John 2</a>) &#151; for the moisture of the air by natural and artificial processes is changed into wine &#151; or the sudden healing of a large extent of diseased tissue by a draught of water. A miracle is said to be contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> when the effect produced is contrary to the natural course of things.

<p>The term <em>miracle</em> here implies the direct opposition of the effect actually produced to the natural causes at work, and its imperfect understanding has given rise to much confusion in modern thought. Thus <a href="../cathen/14217a.htm">Spinoza</a> calls a miracle a violation of the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> (<em>proeverti</em>, "Tract. Theol. Polit.", vi). Hume says it is a "violation" or an "infraction", and many writers &#151; e.g., Martensen, Hodge, Baden-Powell, Theodore Parker &#151; use the term for miracles as a whole. But every miracle is not of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> contrary to <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, for there are miracles above or outside <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Again, the term <em>contrary to nature</em> does not mean "unnatural" in the sense of producing discord and confusion. The forces of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> differ in power and are in constant interaction. This produces interferences and counteractions of forces. This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of mechanical, chemical, and <a href="../cathen/02572a.htm">biological</a> forces. So, also, at every moment of the day I interfere with and counteract natural forces about me. I study the properties of natural forces with a view to obtain <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">conscious</a> control by intelligent counteractions of one force against another. Intelligent counteraction marks progress in chemistry, in <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physics</a> &#151; e.g., steam locomotion, aviation &#151; and in the prescriptions of the physician. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> controls <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, nay, can live only by the counteraction of natural forces. Though all this goes on around us, we never speak of natural forces violated. These forces are still working after their kind, and no force is destroyed, nor is any <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> broken, nor does confusion result. The introduction of human will may bring about a displacement of the physical forces, but no infraction of physical processes.

<p>Now in a miracle <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> action relative to its bearing on natural forces is analogous to the action of human <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>. Thus, e.g., it is against the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of iron to float, but the action of <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> in raising the axe-head to the surface of the water (<a href="../bible/2ki006.htm">2 Kings 6</a>) is no more a violation, or a transgression, or an infraction of natural <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> than if he raised it with his hand. Again, it is of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of fire to burn, but when, e.g., the Three Children were preserved untouched in the fiery furnace (<a href="../bible/dan003.htm">Daniel 3</a>) there was nothing unnatural in the act, as these writers use the word, any more than there would be in erecting a dwelling absolutely fireproof. In the one case, as in the other, there was no paralysis of natural forces and no consequent disorder.

<p>The extraordinary element in the miracle &#151; i.e. an event apart from the ordinary course of things; enables us to understand the teaching of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> that events which ordinarily take place in the natural or <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> course of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> are not miracles, although they are beyond the efficiency of natural forces. Thus, e.g., the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not a miracle, for it takes place in the ordinary course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Again, the <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> of the sinner, the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Eucharistic Presence</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacramental</a> effects, are not miracles for two reasons: they are beyond the grasp of the senses and they have place in the ordinary course of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">God's supernatural Providence</a>.

<p>(2) The word <em>dynamis</em>, "power" is used in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> to signify: <ul><li>the power of working miracles, (<em>en dymamei semeion</em> &#151; <a href="../bible/rom015.htm#vrs19">Romans 15:19</a>); <li>mighty works as the effects of this power, i.e., miracles themselves (<em>al pleistai dynameis autou</em> &#151; <a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs20">Matthew 11:20</a>) and expresses the efficient cause of the miracle, i.e., Divine power.</ul> Hence the miracle is called <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, because the effect is beyond the productive power of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and implies <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> agency. Thus <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> teaches: "Those effects are rightly to be termed miracles which are wrought by Divine power apart from the order usually observed in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" (Contra Gent., III, cii), and they are apart from the natural order because they are "beyond the order or <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>" (<a href="../summa/1102.htm#article4">ST I:102:4</a>). Hence dynamis adds to the meaning of terata by pointing out the efficient cause. For this reason miracles in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> are called "the finger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/exo008.htm#vrs19">Exodus 8:19</a>, <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#vrs20">Luke 11:20</a>), "the hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>" (<a href="../bible/1sa005.htm#vrs6">1 Samuel 5:6</a>), "the hand of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/ezr008.htm#vrs31">Ezra 8:31</a>). In referring the miracle to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as its efficient cause the answer is given to the objection that the miracle is unnatural, i.e., an uncaused event without meaning or place in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. With <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the cause, the miracle has a place in the designs of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">God's Providence</a> (Contra Gent. III, xcviii). In this sense &#151; i.e., relatively to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> &#151; St. Augustine speaks of the miracle as natural (<a href="../fathers/120121.htm"><em>City of God</em> XXI.8</a>).



<p>An event is above the course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and beyond its productive powers: <ul><li>with regard to its <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, i.e., when the effect is of such a kind that no natural power could bring it to pass in any manner or form whatsoever, as e.g., the raising to <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> son (<a href="../bible/luk007.htm">Luke 7</a>), or the cure of the man born blind (<a href="../bible/joh009.htm">John 9</a>). These miracles are called miracles as to <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> (<em>quoad substantiam</em>). <li>With regard to the manner in which the effect is produced i.e., where there may be forces in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> fitted and capable of producing the effect considered in itself, yet the effect is produced in a manner wholly different from the manner in which it should naturally be performed, i.e., instantaneously, by a word, e.g., the cure of the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> (<a href="../bible/luk005.htm">Luke 5</a>). These are called miracles as to the manner of their production (quoad modum).</ul>

<p><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power is shown in the miracle:

<ul><li>directly through His own immediate action or <li>mediately through creatures as means or instruments.</ul>

<p>In the latter case the effects must be ascribed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for He works in and through the instruments; "Ipso Deo in illis operante" (Augustine, <a href="../fathers/120110.htm"><em>City of God</em> X.12</a>). Hence <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> works miracles through the instrumentality <ul><li>of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, e.g., the Three Children in the fiery furnace (<a href="../bible/dan003.htm">Daniel 3</a>), the deliverance of St. Peter from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> (<a href="../bible/act012.htm">Acts 12</a>); <li>of men, e.g., <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> (<a href="../bible/exo007.htm">Exodus 7</a>), <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> (<a href="../bible/1ki017.htm">1 Kings 17</a>), <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki005.htm">2 Kings 5</a>), the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs43">Acts 2:43</a>), St. Peter (<a href="../bible/act003.htm#vrs9">Acts 3:9</a>), <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/act019.htm">Acts 19</a>), the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs5">Galatians 3:5</a>). <li>In the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> also, as in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, we learn that animate things are instruments of Divine power, not because they have any excellence in themselves, but through a special relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus we distinguish <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">holy relics</a>, e.g., the mantle of <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki002.htm">2 Kings 2</a>), the body of <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki013.htm">2 Kings 13</a>), the hem of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> garment (<a href="../bible/mat009.htm">Matthew 9</a>), the handkerchiefs of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/act019.htm#vrs12">Acts 19:12</a>); <a href="../cathen/07625a.htm">holy images</a>, e.g., the brazen serpent (<a href="../bible/num021.htm">Numbers 21</a>) <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things, e.g., the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a> (<a href="../bible/dan005.htm">Daniel 5</a>); <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, e.g., the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple of Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/2ch006.htm#vrs7">2 Chronicles 6:7</a>), the waters of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki005.htm">2 Kings 5</a>), the <a href="../cathen/02536a.htm">Pool of Bethsaida</a> (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm">John 5</a>).</ul>

<p>Hence the contention of some modern writers, that a miracle requires an immediate action of Divine power, is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. It is sufficient that the miracle be due to the intervention of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is revealed by the utter lack of proportion between the effect and what are called means or instruments.

<p>The word <em>semeion</em> means "sign", an appeal to intelligence, and expresses the purpose or final cause of the miracle. A miracle is a factor in the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Providence of God</a> over men. Hence the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of men are the primary or supreme ends of every miracle. This is clearly expressed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in the raising of <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> (<a href="../bible/joh011.htm">John 11</a>), and the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> says that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, in working His first miracle at <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a>, "manifested his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh002.htm#vrs11">John 2:11</a>). Therefore the miracle must be worthy the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and conducive to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of men. Hence they are not performed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to repair physical defects in His <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a>, nor are they intended to produce, nor do they produce, disorder or discord; do they contain any element which is wicked, ridiculous, useless, or unmeaning. Hence they are not on the same plane with mere wonders, tricks works of ingenuity, or magic. The efficacy, usefulness, purpose of the work and the manner of performing it clearly show that it must be ascribed to Divine power. This high standing and dignity of the miracle is shown, e.g., in the miracles of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> (<a href="../bible/exo007.htm">Exodus 7</a>-<a href="../bible/exo010.htm">10</a>), of <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> (<a href="../bible/1ki018.htm#vrs21">1 Kings 18:21-38</a>), of <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki005.htm">2 Kings 5</a>). The multitudes glorified <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at the cure of the paralytic (<a href="../bible/mat009.htm#vrs8">Matthew 9:8</a>), of the blind man (<a href="../bible/luk018.htm#vrs43">Luke 18:43</a>), at the miracles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in general (<a href="../bible/mat015.htm#vrs31">Matthew 15:31</a>, <a href="../bible/luk019.htm#vrs37">Luke 19:37</a>), as at the cure of the lame man by St. Peter (<a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs21">Acts 4:21</a>). Hence miracles are signs of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> world and our connection with it.

<p>In miracles we can always distinguish secondary ends, subordinate, however, to the primary ends. Thus <ul><li>they are evidences attesting and confirming the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of a Divine mission, or of a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, e.g., <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> (<a href="../bible/exo004.htm">Exodus 4</a>), <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> (<a href="../bible/1ki017.htm#vrs24">1 Kings 17:24</a>). For this reason the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> see in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> "the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm#vrs14">John 6:14</a>), in whom "God hath visited his people" (<a href="../bible/luk007.htm#vrs16">Luke 7:16</a>). Hence the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him (<a href="../bible/joh002.htm#vrs11">John 2:11</a>) and <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs2">John 3:2</a>) and the man born blind (<a href="../bible/joh009.htm#vrs38">John 9:38</a>), and the many who had seen the raising of <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> (<a href="../bible/joh011.htm#vrs45">John 11:45</a>). <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> constantly appealed to His "works" to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that He was sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, e.g., to the Disciples of John (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs4">Matthew 11:4</a>), to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#vrs37">John 10:37</a>). He claims that His miracles are a greater testimony than the testimony of John (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#vrs36">John 5:36</a>), condemns those who will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#vrs24">John 15:24</a>), as He praises those who do (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm#vrs8">John 17:8</a>), and exhibits miracles as the signs of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">True</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs17">Mark 16:17</a>). The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> appeal to miracles as the confirmation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Divinity and mission (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs31">John 20:31</a>; <a href="../bible/act010.htm#vrs38">Acts 10:38</a>), and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> counts them as the signs of his <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostleship</a> (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#vrs12">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>). <li>Miracles are wrought to attest <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. Thus, e.g., <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> defends <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> (<a href="../bible/num012.htm">Numbers 12</a>), <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki001.htm">2 Kings 1</a>), <a href="../cathen/05386c.htm">Eliseus</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki013.htm">2 Kings 13</a>). Hence the testimony of the man born blind (<a href="../bible/joh009.htm#vrs30">John 9:30 sqq.</a>) and the official processes in the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. <li>As benefits either spiritual or temporal. The temporal favours are always subordinate to spiritual ends, for they are a reward or a pledge of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Sarephta (<a href="../bible/1ki017.htm">1 Kings 17</a>), the Three Children in the fiery furnace (<a href="../bible/dan003.htm">Daniel 3</a>), the preservation of <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> (<a href="../bible/dan005.htm">Daniel 5</a>), the deliverance of St. Peter from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> (<a href="../bible/act012.htm">Acts 12</a>), of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> from shipwreck (<a href="../bible/act027.htm">Acts 27</a>). Thus <em>semeion</em>, i.e., "sign", completes the meaning of <em>dynamis</em>, i.e., "[Divine] power". It reveals the miracle as an act of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">God's supernatural Providence</a> over men. It gives a positive content to <em>teras</em>, i.e., "wonder", for, whereas the wonder shows the miracle as a deviation from the ordinary course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the sign gives the purpose of the deviation.</ul>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/01450a.htm">analysis</a> shows that <ul><li>the miracle is essentially an appeal to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore miracles can be distinguished from purely natural occurrences. A miracle is a fact in material <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a>, and falls under the observation of the senses or comes to us through testimony, like any natural fact. Its miraculous character is known: <ul><li>from positive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of natural forces, e.g., the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of gravity, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> that fire burns. To say that we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and therefore cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a miracle (Rousseau, "Lett. de la Mont.", let. iii), is beside the question, for it would make the miracle an appeal to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. I may not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the penal code, but I can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that in a particular instance a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> violates one definite <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. <li>From our positive <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the limits of natural forces. Thus, e.g., we may not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the strength of a man, but we do <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he cannot by himself move a mountain. In enlarging our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of natural forces, the progress of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> has curtailed their sphere and defined their limits, as in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/02571a.htm">abiogenesis</a>. Hence, as soon as we have reason to suspect that any event, however uncommon or rare it appear, may arise from natural causes or be conformable to the usual course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, we immediately lose the conviction of its being a miracle. A miracle is a manifestation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power; so long as this is not clear, we hould reject it as such.</ul> <li>Miracles are signs of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">God's Providence</a> over men, hence they are of high <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> character, simple and obvious in the forces at work, in the circumstances of their working, and in their aim and purpose. Now <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> indicates the possibility, and <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Revelation</a> teaches the fact, that spiritual beings, both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and bad, exist, and possess greater power than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> possesses. Apart from the speculative question as to the native power of these beings, we are <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> <ul><li>that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone can perform those effects which are called <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substantial</a> miracles, e.g., raising the dead to <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, <li>that miracles performed by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as recorded in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, are always ascribed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> gives Divine authority to no miracles less than Divine; <li>that <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> shows the power of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> as strictly conditioned, e.g., testimony of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> magicians (<a href="../bible/exo008.htm#vrs19">Exodus 8:19</a>), the story of Job, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> acknowledging the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#vrs31">Matthew 8:31</a>), the express testimony of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> himself (<a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs24">Matthew 24:24</a>) and of the <a href="../cathen/01594b.htm">Apocalypse</a> (<a href="../bible/rev009.htm#vrs14">Revelation 9:14</a>). Granting that these <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirits</a> may perform prodigies &#151; i.e., works of skill and ingenuity which, relatively to our powers, may seem to be miraculous &#151; yet these works lack the meaning and purpose which would stamp them as the language of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to men.</ul></ul>
<h2 id="section2">Errors</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deists</a> reject miracles, for they deny the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Providence of God</a>. <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnostics</a> also, and <a href="../cathen/12312c.htm">Positivists</a> reject them: Comte regarded miracles as the fruit of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. Modern <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> has no place for miracles. Thus <a href="../cathen/14217a.htm">Spinoza</a> held <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a> to be the aspect of the one <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a>, i.e., <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, as he taught that miracles were a violation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, they would therefore be a violation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The answer is, first that <a href="../cathen/14217a.htm">Spinoza's</a> conception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and, secondly, that in fact miracles are not a violation of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. To <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a> is the evolutive manifestation of the one Absolute Idea, i.e., <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to the neo-Hegelians (e.g., Thos. Green) <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">consciousness</a> is identified with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; therefore to both a miracle has no meaning.

<p><a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">Erroneous</a> definitions of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> lead to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> definitions of the miracle. Thus <ul><li>Bushnell defines the natural to be what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> to be what is free; therefore the material world is what we call <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the world of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> is <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. So also Dr. Strong ("Baptist Rev.", vol. I, 1879), Rev. C.A. Row ("Supernat. in the New Test.", London, 1875). In this sense every <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">free volition of man</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> act and a miracle. <li>The natural supernaturalism proposed by Carlyle, Theodore Parker, Prof. Pfleiderer, and, more recently, Prof. Everett ("The Psychologic Elem. of Relig. Faith", London and New York, 1902), Prof. Bowne ("Immanence of God", Boston and New York, 1905), Hastings ("Diction. of Christ and the Gospels", s.v. "Miracles"). Thus the natural and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> are in reality one: the natural is its aspect to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> is its aspect to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <li>The "Immediate theory", that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> acts immediately without second causes, or that second causes, or <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, must be defined as the regular methods of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> acting. This teaching is combined with the doctrine of evolution. <li>The "relative" theory of miracles is by far the most popular with non-Catholic writers. This view was originally proposed to hold <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> miracles and at the same <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> hold <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the uniformity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Its main forms are three.</ul>
<h3 id="A">The mechanical view of Babbage (Bridgewater Treatises)</h3>

<p>In Babbage's view, which was later advanced by the Duke of Argyll (Reign of Law), <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is presented as a vast <a href="../cathen/10100a.htm">mechanism</a> wound up in the beginning and containing in itself the capacity to deviate at stated times from its ordinary course. The theory is ingenious, but it makes the miracle a natural event. It admits the assumption of opponents of miracles, viz., that physical effects must have physical causes, but this assumption is contradicted by common facts of experience, e.g., will acts on <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a>.
<h3 id="B">The "unknown" law of Spinoza</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/14217a.htm">Spinoza</a> taught that the term <em>miracle</em> should be understood with reference to the opinions of men, and that it means simply an event which we are unable to explain by other events familiar to our experience. Locke, <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, Eichhorn, Paulus Renan hold the same view. Thus Prof. Cooper writes "The miracle of one age becomes the ordinary working of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the next" ("Ref. Ch. R.", July, 1900). Hence a miracle never happened in fact, and is only a name to cover our <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Thus Matthew Arnold could claim that all <a href="../bible/index.html">Biblical</a> miracles will disappear with the progress of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> (Lit. and Bible) and M. Muller that "the miraculous is reduced to mere seeming" (in Rel., pref., p. 10). The advocates of this theory assume that miracles are an appeal to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.
<h3 id="C">The "higher law" theory of Argyll of "Unseen Universe"</h3>

<p>Trench, Lange (on Matt., p. 153), Gore (Bampton Lect, p. 36) proposed to refute <a href="../cathen/14217a.htm">Spinoza's</a> claim that miracles are unnatural and productive of disorder. Thus with them the miracle is quite natural because it takes place in accordance with <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of a higher <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Others &#151; e.g., Schleiermacher and <a href="../cathen/13086a.htm">Ritschl</a> &#151; mean by higher <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, subjective religious feeling. Thus, to them a miracle is not different from any other natural event; it becomes a miracle by relation to the religious feeling. A writer in "The Biblical World" (Oct., 1908) holds that the miracle consists in the religious significance of the natural event in its relation to the religious appreciation as a sign of Divine favour. Others explain higher <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> as a <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, or <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>. Thus the miracles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are understood as illustrations of a higher, grander, more comprehensive <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> than men had yet known, the incoming of a new <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, of higher forces acting according to higher <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as manifestations of the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a> in the higher stages of its development. The criticism of this theory is that miracles would cease to be miracles: they would not be extraordinary, for they would take place under the same conditions. To bring miracles under a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> not yet understood is to deny their <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Thus, when Trench defines a miracle as "an extraordinary event which beholders can reduce to no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> with which they are acquainted", the definition includes <a href="../cathen/07604b.htm">hypnotism</a> and clairvoyance. If by <em>higher <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a></em> we mean the high <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, then a miracle can be referred to this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but the higher <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in this case is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself and the use of the term is apt to create confusion.
<h2 id="section3">Antecedent improbability</h2>

<p>The great problem of modern <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> is the place and value of miracles. In the opinion of certain writers, their antecedent improbability, based on the universal reign of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is so great that they are not worthy of serious consideration. Thus his conviction of the uniformity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> led Hume to deny testimony for miracles in general, as it led Baur, Strauss, and Renan to explain the miracles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on natural grounds. The fundamental principle is that whatever happens is natural, and what is not natural does not happen. On <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the uniformity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is based the profound conviction of the organic unity of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, a characteristic trait of nineteenth-century thought. It has dominated a certain <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of literature, and, with George Eliot, Hall Came, and Thomas Hardy, the natural agencies of <a href="../cathen/07254a.htm">heredity</a>, environment, and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> rule the world of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. It is the basic principle in modern treatises on <a href="../cathen/14115a.htm">sociology</a>.

<p>Its chief exponent is <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, a continuation of the <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deism</a> of the eighteenth century without the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the view herein presented, of an evolving <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> working out its own destiny under the rigid sway of inherent natural <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, finds but a thin disguise in the <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheistic</a> conception, so prevalent among non-Catholic <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, of an <a href="../cathen/07682a.htm">immanent</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the active ground of the world-development according to <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> &#151; i.e., <a href="../cathen/10483a.htm">Monism</a> of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> or will. This <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is the gulf between the old and the modern <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Max Muller finds the kernel of the modern conception of the world in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that "there is a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and order in everything, and that an unbroken chain of causes and effects holds the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> together" ("Anthrop. Relig.", pref., p. 10). Throughout the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> there is a <a href="../cathen/10100a.htm">mechanism</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, presenting a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> chain, or sequence, of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and effect, which is not, and cannot be, broken by an interference from without, as is assumed in the case of a miracle. This view is the ground of modern objections to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, the source of modern <a href="../cathen/13516b.htm">scepticism</a>, and the reason for a prevailing disposition among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> thinkers to deny miracles a place in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> evidences and to base the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> on internal evidences alone.
<h3>Criticism</h3>

<p>(1) This view ultimately rests upon the assumption that the material <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> alone exists. It is refuted: <ul><li>by <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proving</a> that in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> there is a spiritual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> totally distinct from organic and inorganic <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and that this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> reveals an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> order totally distinct from the physical order; <li>by inferring the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> from the phenomena of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a>, and the physical order.</ul>

<p>(2) This view is also based on an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> meaning of the term <em>nature</em>. <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> made a distinction between the <em>noumenon</em> and the <em>phenomenon</em> of a thing, he denied that we can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <em>noumenon</em>, i.e., the thing in itself; all we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is the <em>phenomenon</em>, i.e., the appearance of the thing. This distinction has profoundly influenced modern thought. As a Transcendental <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">Idealist</a>, <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> denied that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the real phenomenon; to him only the ideal appearance is the object of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is a succession of ideal appearances, and a miracle would be an interruption of that succession. Others, i.e., the Sense-School (Hume, Mill, Bain, Spencer, and others), teach that, while we cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> or <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essences</a> of things, we can and do grasp the real phenomena. To them the world is a phenomenal world and is a pure coexistence and succession of phenomena, the antecedent determines the consequent. In this view a miracle would be an unexplained break in the (so-called) invariable <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of sequence, on which <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> Mill based his <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">Logic</a>. Now we reply that the real meaning of the word <em>nature</em> includes both the phenomenon and the noumenon. We have the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> with an objective content. In reality the progress of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> consists in the observation of, and experimentation upon, things with a view to find out their properties or potencies, which in turn enable us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the physical essences of the various substances.

<p>(3) Through the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> conception of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the principle of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> is confounded with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the uniformity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But they are absolutely different things. The former is a primary conviction which has its source in our inner <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">consciousness</a>. The latter is an <a href="../cathen/07779a.htm">induction</a> based upon a long and careful observation of facts: it is not a self-evident <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, nor is it a universal and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> principle, as Mill himself has shown (Logic, IV, xxi). In fact uniformity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the result of the principle of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causation</a>.

<p>(4) The main contention, that the uniformity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> rules miracles out of consideration, because they would imply a break in the uniformity and a violation of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are the observed modes or processes in which natural forces act. These forces are the properties or potencies of the essences of natural things. Our experience of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causation</a> is not the experience of a mere sequence but of a sequence due to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> operation of essences viewed as principles or sources of action.

<p>Now essences are necessarily what they are and unchangeable, therefore their properties, or potencies, or forces, under given circumstances, act in the same way. On this, <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a> bases the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is uniform in its action, yet holds that constancy of succession is not an absolute <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> for the succession is only constant so long as the noumenal relations remain the same. Thus <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a>, in defending miracles, accepts the universal reign of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in this sense, and its teaching is in absolute accord with the methods actually pursued by modern <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> in <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> investigations. Hence it teaches the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and the reign of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and openly declares that, if there were no order, there would be no miracle.

<p>It is significant that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appeals</a> constantly to the reign of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, while it attests the actual occurrence of miracles. Now human will, in acting on material forces, interferes with the regular sequences, but does not paralyze the natural forces or destroy their innate tendency to act in a uniform manner. Thus a boy, by throwing a stone into the air, does not disarrange the order of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or do away with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of gravity. A new force only is brought in and counteracts the tendencies of the natural forces, just as the natural forces interact and counteract among themselves, as is shown in the well-known <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of the parallelogram of forces and the distinction between kinetic and potential energy. The <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogy</a> from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> act to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> act is complete as far as concerns a break in the uniformity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or a violation of its <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. The extent of the power exerted does not affect the point at issue. Hence physical <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is presented as a system of physical causes producing uniform results, and yet permits the interposition of personal agency without affecting its stability.

<p>(5) The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this position is so manifest that Mill admits Hume's argument against miracles to be valid only on the supposition that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not exist for, he says, "a miracle is a new effect supposed to be produced by the introduction of a new cause . . . of the adequacy of that cause, if present, there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>" (Logic, III, xxv). Hence, admitting the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, Hume's "uniform sequence" does not hold as an objection to miracles. Huxley also denies that physicists withhold <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in miracles because miracles are in violation of natural <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and he rejects the whole of this line of argument ("Some Controverted questions", 209; "Life of Hume", 132), and holds that a miracle is a question of evidence pure and simple. Hence the objection to miracles on the ground of their antecedent improbability has been abandoned. "The Biblical World" (Oct., 1908) says "The old rigid system of 'Laws of Nature' is being broken up by modern <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. There are many events which <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientists</a> recognize to be inexplicable by any known <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. But this inability to furnish a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> explanation is no reason for denying the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of any event, if it is adequately attested. Thus the old <em>a priori</em> argument against miracles is gone." Thus in modern thought the question of the miracle is simply a question of fact.
<h2 id="section4">Place and value of miracles in the Christian view of the world</h2>

<p>As the great objection to miracles really rests on narrow and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> views of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> world-view is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to grasp their place and value.

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> teaches that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> and governs the world. This government is His Providence. It is shown in the delicate adjustment and subordination of the tendencies proper to material things, resulting in the marvellous stability and harmony which prevail throughout the physical creation, and in the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> order, which through <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, is to guide and control the tendencies of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to a complete harmony in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is a personal being, with intelligence and <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, capable of knowing and serving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> for that purpose. To him <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is the book of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> work revealing the Creator through the design visible in the material order and through <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, the voice of the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> order based in the very constitution of his own being. Hence the relation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a personal one. <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">God's Providence</a> is not confined to the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of Himself through His works. He has manifested Himself in a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> manner throwing a flood of light on the relations which should exist between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and Himself. The <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> contains this <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, and is called the Book of God's Word. It gives the record of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">God's supernatural Providence</a> leading up to the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a> and the founding of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>. Here we are told that beyond the sphere of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> there is another realm of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> &#151; the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, peopled by spiritual beings and departed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Both spheres, the natural and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, are under the overruling <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Providence of God</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> are two great facts. The relation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to its <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Maker</a> is religion.

<p>Religion is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; its expression is called worship, and the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of worship is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Thus between <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> there is constant intercourse, and in <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">God's Providence</a> the appointed means of this intercourse is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. By <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> speaks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in acts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04337a.htm">contrition</a> and implores His aid. In answer to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> acts on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by His grace and, in special circumstances, by working miracles. Hence the great fact of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, as the connecting link of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, implies a constant interference of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Therefore in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> view of the world, miracles have a place and a meaning. They arise out of the personal relation between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. The conviction that the pure of heart are pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in some mysterious way, is worldwide; even among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> pure offerings only are prepared for the sacrifice.

<p>This intimate sense of <a href="../cathen/12396a.htm">God's presence</a> may account for the universal tendency to refer all striking phenomena to <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> causes. <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">Error</a> and exaggeration do not change the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> founded in the abiding conviction of the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Providence of God</a>. To this <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> appealed in his discourse to the Athenians (<a href="../bible/act017.htm">Acts 17</a>). In the miracle, therefore, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> subordinates physical <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to a higher purpose, and this higher purpose is identical with the highest <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> aims of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. The mechanical view of the world is in harmony with the <a href="../cathen/14474a.htm">teleological</a>, and when purpose exists, no event is isolated or unmeaning. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> is <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a miracle is the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> and pledge of His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">supernatural Providence</a>. Hence we can understand how, in devout <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>, there is even a <a href="../cathen/12403a.htm">presumption</a> for and an expectation of miracles. They show the subordination of the lower world to the higher, they are the breaking in of the higher world on the lower ("C. Gent.", III, xcviii, xcix; <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, 1, c,1,IV, p. l.c.I).

<p>Some writers &#151; e.g., <a href="../cathen/11423a.htm">Paley</a>, Mansel, Mozley, Dr. George Fisher &#151; push the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> view to the extreme, and say that miracles are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to attest <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, however, take a broader view. They hold <ul>
<li>that the great primary ends of miracles are the manifestation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of men; that the particular or secondary ends, subordinate to the former, are to confirm the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of a mission or a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, to attest the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> servants, to confer benefits and vindicate Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.
<li>Hence they teach that the attestation of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Revelation</a> is not the primary end of the miracle, but its main secondary end, though not the only one.
<li>They say that the miracles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> but "most fitting and altogether in accord with His mission" (<em>decentissimum et maximopere conveniens</em>) &#151; <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, IV, p. 1, c. 2, n. 3; <a href="../summa/4043.htm#article0">ST III:43</a>) as a means to attest its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. At the same time they place miracles among the strongest and most <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> evidences of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>.
<li>Yet they teach that, as evidences, miracles have not a physical force, i.e., absolutely compelling assent, but only a <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> force, i.e. they do no <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, though their appeal to the assent is of the strongest kind.
<li>That, as evidences, they are not wrought to show the internal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the doctrines, but only to give manifest reasons why we should accept the doctrines. Hence the distinction: not <em>evidenter vera</em>, but <em>evidenter credibilia</em>. For the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Revelation</a>, which miracles attest, contains <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> doctrines above the comprehension of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and positive institutions in <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">God's supernatural Providence</a> over men. Thus the opinion of Locke, Trench, Mill, Mozley, and Cox, that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a> the miracle not the miracle the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.
<li>Finally, they maintain that the miracles of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> and the power in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of working miracles are of Divine <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not, however the miracles of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> themselves. Hence they teach that the former are both evidences of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and objects of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that the latter are evidences of the purpose for which they are wrought, not, however, objects of Divine <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Hence this teaching guards against the other exaggerated view recently proposed by non-Catholic writers, who hold that miracles are now considered not as evidences but as objects of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</ul>
<h2 id="section5">Testimony</h2>

<p>A miracle, like any natural event, is known either from personal observation or from the testimony of others. In the miracle we have the fact itself as an external occurrence and its miraculous character. The miraculous character of the fact consists in this: that its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and the surrounding circumstances are of such a kind that we are forced to admit natural forces alone could not have produced it, and the only rational explanation is to be had in the interference of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Divine</a> agency. The perception of its miraculous character is a rational act of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and is simply the application of the principle of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> with the methods of <a href="../cathen/07779a.htm">induction</a>. The general rules governing the acceptance of testimony apply to miracles as to other facts of history. If we have <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> evidence for the fact, we are bound to accept it. The evidence for miracles, as for historical facts in general, depends on the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">veracity</a> of the narrators, i.e., they who testify to the occurrence of the events must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what they tell and tell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The extraordinary <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the miracle requires more complete and accurate investigation. Such testimony we are not free to reject; otherwise we must deny all history whatsoever. We have no more rational warrant for rejecting miracles than for rejecting accounts of stellar eclipses. Hence, they who deny miracles have concentrated their efforts with the purpose of destroying the historical evidence for all miracles whatsoever and especially the evidence for the miracles of the Gospel.

<p>Hume held that no testimony could <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> miracles, for it is more probable that the testimony is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> than that the miracles are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But <ul><li>his contention that "a uniform experience", which is "a direct and full <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>", is against miracles, is denied by Mill, provided an adequate cause &#151; i.e., <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> &#151; <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">exists</a>. <li>Hume's "experience" may mean: (a) the experience of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a>, and his argument is made absurd (e.g., historic <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> about <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>) or (b) the experience of the race, which has become common property and the type of what may be expected. Now in fact we get this by testimony; many <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> facts are part of this race experience; this <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> part Hume prejudges, arbitrarily declares it <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, which is the point to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> and assumes that <em>miraculous</em> is synonymous with <em>absurd</em>. The past, so expurgated, is made the test of the future, and should prevent the consistent advocates of Hume from accepting the discoveries of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. <li>Hard-pressed, Hume is forced to make the distinction between testimony contrary to experience and testimony not conformable to experience, and holds that the latter may be accepted &#151; e.g., testimony of ice to the Indian prince. But this admission is fatal to his position. <li>Hume proceeds on the supposition that, for practical purposes, all the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are known, yet experience shows that this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. <li>His whole argument rests upon the rejected <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> principle that external experience is the sole source of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, rests upon the discredited basis that miracles are opposed to the uniformity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as violations of natural <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and was advanced through prejudice against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Hence later <a href="../cathen/13516b.htm">sceptics</a> have receded from Hume's extreme position and teach, not that miracles cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, but that as a matter of fact they are not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>.</ul>

<p>The attack by Hume on miracles in general has been applied to the miracles of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, and has received added weight from the denial of <a href="../cathen/08045a.htm">Divine inspiration</a>. Varying in form, its basic principle is the same, viz., the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> applied to <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. Thus we have:
<h3 id="A">The interpretation theory</h3>

<p>The old <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> of Semler Eichhorn, de Wette, and Paulus, who held the credibility of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> records, but contended that they were a collection of writings composed by natural intelligence alone, and to be treated on the same plane with other natural productions of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. They got rid of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> by a bold interpretation of miracles as purely natural facts. This is called the "interpretation" theory, and appears today under two forms:

<p>Modified <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>, which teaches that we are warranted in accepting a very considerable portion of the Gospel narratives as substantially historical, without being compelled to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in any miracles. Hence they give credence to the accounts of the <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniacs</a> and healings, but allege that these wonders were wrought by, or in accordance with, <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. Thus we have the electric theory of M. Corelli, the appeal to "moral therapeutics" by Matthew Arnold, and the <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> theory advanced by Prof. Bousset of Gottingen, in which he claims that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> performed miracles by natural <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> powers of a superior kind (cf. "N. World", March 1896). But the attempt to explain the miracles of the Gospel either by the natural powers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, i.e., <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> superiority, or by peculiar states of the recipient, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cure, and allied psychic phenomena, is arbitrary and not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to facts. In many of the miracles <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not required, and is in fact absent this is shown, in the miracles of power, by the expressed <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, e.g., at <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> stilling the tempest (<a href="../bible/mar004.htm#vrs40">Mark 4:40</a>), at <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on the waters (<a href="../bible/mar006.htm#vrs51">Mark 6:51</a>), at the draught of fishes (<a href="../bible/luk005.htm#vrs8">Luke 5:8</a>), and in the miracles of expelling demons. In some miracles <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> requires <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not the cause of the miracle, only the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of His exercising the power.

<p>Others, like Holstein, Renan, and Huxley, follow de Wette, who explains the miracles as the emotional interpretation of commonplace events. They claim that the facts which occurred were substantially historical, but in the narrating were covered over with the interpretations of the writers. Hence, they say that, in studying the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, we must distinguish between the facts as they actually took place and the subjective emotions of those who <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnessed</a> them, their strong excitement, tendency to exaggeration, and vivid <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. Thus they appeal not to the "fallacies of testimony" so much as to the "fallacies of the senses". But this attempt to transform the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> into nervous visionaries cannot be held by an unbiased <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. St. Peter clearly distinguished between a vision (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#vrs17">Acts 10:17</a>) and a reality (<a href="../bible/act012.htm">Acts 12</a>), and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> mentions two cases of <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> (<a href="../bible/act022.htm#vrs17">Acts 22:17</a>; <a href="../bible/2co012.htm">2 Corinthians 12</a>), the latter by way of contrast with his ordinary missionary life of labours and sufferings (<a href="../bible/2co011.htm">2 Corinthians 11</a>). Renan even goes so far as to present the glaring inconsistency of a <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> remarkable, as he says, for <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> beauty of life and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, who nevertheless is guilty of <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">conscious</a> deception, as, e.g., in the make-believe raising of <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a>. This teaching is in reality a denial of testimony. The miracles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> must be taken as a whole; and in the Gospel setting where they are presented as a part of his teaching and his life. On the ground of evidence there is no reason to make a distinction among them or to interpret them so that they become other than they are. The real reason is prejudgment on <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> grounds with a view to get rid of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> element. In fact the conjectures and hypotheses proposed are far more improbable than the miracles themselves. Again, how thus explain the great miracle that the hero of a baseless legend, the impotent and deceitful <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, could be come the founder of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> and of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian civilization</a>? Finally, this method violates the first principles of interpretation; for the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> writers are not allowed to speak their own language.
<h3 id="B">The theory of Biblical Humanism</h3>

<p>The fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel's</a> <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysic</a> (viz., that existing things are the progressive manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, i.e., the absolute) gave a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> basis for the organic conception of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, i.e., the Divine as organic to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> is presented as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> process, and history &#151; e.g., the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> &#151; is a record of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> experience, the product of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. This <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of history was applied to explain the miraculous in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and appears under two forms: the T&uuml;bingen School and the "Mystical" School.

<p><em>(a) the T&uuml;bingen School</em>

<p>Baur regards the <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegelian</a> process in its objective aspect, i.e., the facts as things. He held the books of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> to be states through which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life and thought of early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had passed. He attempted to do with reference to the origin what Gibbon tried with reference to the spread of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> &#151; i.e., get rid of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> by the tacit assumption that there were no miracles and by the enumeration of natural causes, chief of which was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> to which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> accommodated Himself. The evolution element in Baur's <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a>, however, constrained him to deny that we possess contemporaneous documents of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life</a>, to hold that the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> literature was the result of warring factions among the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and therefore of a much later <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> than tradition ascribes to it, and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was only the occasional cause of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. He accepted as genuine only the Epistles to the <a href="../bible/gal000.htm">Galatians</a>, <a href="../bible/rom000.htm">Romans</a>, <a href="../bible/1co000.htm">1</a> and <a href="../bible/2co000.htm">2 Corinthians</a>, and the <a href="../bible/rev000.htm">Apocalypse</a>. But the Epistles admitted by Baur show that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in miracles and asserted the actual occurrence of them as well-known facts both in regard to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and in regard to himself and the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (e.g., <a href="../bible/rom015.htm#vrs18">Romans 15:18</a>; <a href="../bible/1co001.htm#vrs22">1 Corinthians 1:22</a>; <a href="../bible/1co012.htm#vrs10">12:10</a>, <a href="../bible/2co012.htm#vrs12">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>, <a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs5">Galatians 3:5</a>, especially his repeated references to the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a>, <a href="../bible/1co015.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>). The basis on which the T&uuml;bingen School rests, viz., that we possess no contemporaneous records of <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">Christ's life</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> writings belong to the second century, has been proved to be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> by the higher criticisms. Hence Huxley admits that this position is no longer tenable (The Nineteenth Century, Feb., 1889), and in fact there is no longer a T&uuml;bingen School at <a href="../cathen/15083a.htm">T&uuml;bingen</a>. Harnack says: "As regards the criticisms of the sources of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, we stand unquestionably in a movement of return to tradition. The chronological framework in which tradition set the earliest documents is to be henceforth accepted in its main outlines" (The Nineteenth Cent., Oct., 1899). Hence Romanes said that the outcome of the battle on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> documents is a signal victory for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> (Thoughts on Religion, p. 165). Dr. Emil Reich speaks of the bankruptcy of the higher criticism ("Contemp. Rev.", April, 1905).

<p><em>(b) The "Mythical" School</em>

<p>Strauss regarded the <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegelian</a> process in its subjective aspect. The facts as matters of <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">consciousness</a> with the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> concerned him exclusively. Hence he regarded <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> within the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">consciousness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, and held that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> was the outcome of this <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">consciousness</a>. He did not deny a relatively small nucleus of historical reality, but contended that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, as we possess them, are mythical inventions or fabulous and fanciful embellishments and are to be regarded only as symbols for spiritual <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, e.g., the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. Strauss thus attempted to remove the miraculous &#151; or what he considered the unhistorical matter &#151; from the text. But this view was too fanciful long to hold currency after a careful study of the truthful, matter-of-fact character of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> writings, and a comparison of them with the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">Apocrypha</a>. Hence it has been rejected, and Strauss himself confessed to disappointment at the result of his labours (The Old and New Faith).
<h3 id="C">The Critical Agnostic School</h3>

<p>Its basis is the organic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, but it views the world process apart from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, and therefore, to the <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnostic</a>, He does not <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">exist</a> (e.g., Huxley); or to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnostic</a>, His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is accepted on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> (s.g., Baden-Powell). To both there is no miracle, for we have no way of knowing it. Thus Huxley admits the facts of miracles in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, but says that the testimony as to their miraculous character may be worthless, and strives to explain it by the subjective <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of the writers ("The Nineteenth Cent.", Mar., 1889). Baden-Powell (in "Essays and Reviews"), Holtzmann (Die synoptischen Evangelien), and Harnack (The Essence of Christianity) admit the miracles as recorded in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, but hold that their miraculous character is beyond the scope of historical <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, and depends on the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> assumptions of the readers.

<p><em>Criticism</em>

<p>The real problem of the historian is to state well-authenticated facts and give an explanation of the testimony. He should show how such events must have taken place and how such a theory only can explain them. He takes cognizance of all that is said about these events by competent <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>, and from their testimony he draws the conclusion. To admit the facts and to deny an explanation is to furnish very great evidence for their historical <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and to show qualities not consistent with the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> historian.
<h3 id="D">The theory of liberal Protestantism</h3>

<p><em>(a) Older form</em>

<p>In its older form, this was advocated by Carlyle (Froude's "Life of Carlyle"), Martineau (Seal of Authority in Religion), Rathbone Greg (Creed of Christendom), Prof. Wm. H. Green (Works, III pp. 230, 253), proposed as a religious creed under the title of the "new <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>" ("The Nineteenth Cent.", Mar., 1889) and popularized by Mrs. Humphry Ward in "Robert Elsmere." As the old <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was a movement to destroy the Divine authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by exalting the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, so the new <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> aimed at removing the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> element from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and resting <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> on the high <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> character of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and the excellence of His <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> teaching. It is in close sympathy with some writers on the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of religion who see in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> a natural religion, though superior to other forms. In describing their position as "a revolt against miraculous <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>", its adherents yet profess great reverence for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> as "that friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a>, in whom, through all human frailty and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> imperfection, they see the natural head of their inmost life, the symbol of those religious forces in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> which are primitive, essential and universal" ("The Nineteenth Cent.", Mar., 1889). By way of criticism it may be said that this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> has its source in the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> assumption that the uniformity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> has made the miracle unthinkable &#151; an assumption now discarded. Again, it has its basis in the T&uuml;bingen School which has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, and it requires a mutilation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> so radical and wholesale that nearly every sentence has to be excised or rewritten. The miracles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> are too essential a part of His life and teaching to be thus removed. We might as well expurgate the records of military achievements from the lives of Alexander or of Caesar. Strauss exposed the inconsistencies of this position, which he once held (Old Faith and the New), and von Hartmann considered the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberal</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> as causing the disintegration of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> ("Selbstersetzung des Christ", 1888).

<p><em>(b) Newer form</em>

<p>In its recent form, it has been advocated by the exponents of the <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> theory. Hence, where the old school followed an objective, this pursues a subjective method. This theory combines the basic teaching of <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a>, Schleiermacher, and <a href="../cathen/13086a.htm">Ritschl</a>. <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a> taught that religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> are the figurative representation of rational <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; Schleiermacher taught that propositions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> states of the heart expressed in language; <a href="../cathen/13086a.htm">Ritschl</a>, that the evidence of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> is in the "value judgment", i.e., the religious effect on the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>; on this basis Prof. Gardner ("A Historical View of the New Test.", London, 1904) holds that no reasonable <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> would profess to disprove the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> miracles historically; that in historical studies we must accept the principle of continuity as set forth by evolution, that the statements of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> are based mainly on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> experience, in which there is always an element of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> theory; that we must distinguish between the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> underlying fact and its defective outward expression; that this expression is conditioned by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> atmosphere of the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, and passes away to give place to a higher and better expression. Hence the outward expression of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> should be different now from what it was in other days. Hence, while miracles may have had their value for the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, they have no value for us, for our experience is different from theirs. Thus M. R&eacute;ville ("Liberal Christianity", London, 1903) says: "The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of a liberal <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> does not depend upon the solution of a problem of <a href="../cathen/04503a.htm">historical criticism</a>. It is founded upon his own experience of the value and power of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel of Christ</a>", and "The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel of Jesus</a> is independent of its local and temporary forms" (pp. 54, 58). All this, however, is <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, not history, it is not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>. So it inverts the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> standard of <a href="../cathen/04503a.htm">historical criticism</a> &#151; viz., we should study past events in the light of their own surroundings, and not from the subjective feeling on the part of the historian of what might, could, or would have occurred. There is no reason to restrict these principles to questions of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">religious history</a>; and if extended to embrace the whole of past history, they would lead to absolute <a href="../cathen/13516b.htm">scepticism</a>.
<h2 id="section6">The fact</h2>

<p>The <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> shows that at all times <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has wrought miracles to attest the Revelation of His will.

<p>(1) The miracles of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">reveal</a> the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Providence of God</a> over His chosen people. They are convincing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> for the commission of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> (<a href="../bible/exo003.htm#vrs4">Exodus 3:4</a>), manifest to the people that <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jehovah</a> is Sovereign Lord (<a href="../bible/exo010.htm#vrs2">Exodus 10:2</a>, <a href="../bible/deu005.htm#vrs25">Deuteronomy 5:25</a>), and are represented as the "finger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" and "the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> punishes <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> for refusing to obey His commands given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and attested by miracles, and is displeased with the infidelity of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for whom He worked many miracles (<a href="../bible/num014.htm">Numbers 14</a>). Miracles convinced the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Sarephta that <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> was "a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/1ki017.htm#vrs24">1 Kings 17:24</a>), made the people cry out in the dispute between <a href="../cathen/05381b.htm">Elias</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, "the Lord he is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/1ki018.htm#vrs39">1 Kings 18:39</a>), <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> Naaman to confess that "there is no other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in all the earth, but only in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>" (<a href="../bible/2ki005.htm#vrs15">2 Kings 5:15</a>), led <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a> to issue a public decree in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> upon the escape of the Three Children from the fiery furnace (<a href="../bible/dan003.htm">Daniel 3</a>), and Darius to issue a like decree on the escape of <a href="../cathen/04620a.htm">Daniel</a> (<a href="../bible/dan005.htm">Daniel 5</a>). The <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> element is conspicuous in the miracles and is in consonance with the exalted <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> character of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jehovah</a>, "a king of absolute <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for his people was conditioned by a <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of absolute righteousness, as foreign to <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> as to Aryan tradition", writes Dr. Robertson Smith ("Religion of the Semites", p. 74, cf. Kuenen, Hibbert Lect., p. 124). Hence the tendency among recent writers on the history of religion to postulate the direct intervention of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> as the only explanation for the exalted conception of the <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">Deity</a> set forth by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.

<p>(2) The <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> reveals a high <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> conception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who works miracles for high <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> purposes, and unfolds a dispensation of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> leading up to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. In fulfillment of this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> works miracles. His answer to the messengers of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> was that they should go and tell <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John</a> what they had seen (<a href="../bible/luk007.htm#vrs22">Luke 7:22</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/isa035.htm#vrs5">Isaiah 35:5</a>). Thus the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>, in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proving</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> from the miracles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, join them with <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> (<a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../fathers/04161.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> I.2</a>, <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, <a href="../fathers/0103102.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> I.2.32</a>; <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, <a href="../fathers/140612.htm"><em>Reply to Faustus</em> XII</a>). <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> openly professed to work miracles. He appeals repeatedly to His "works" as most authentic and decisive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His Divine Sonship (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#vrs18">John 5:18-36</a>; <a href="../bible/joh010.htm#vrs24">10:24-37</a>) and of His mission (<a href="../bible/joh014.htm#vrs12">John 14:12</a>), and for this reason condemns the obstinacy of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as inexcusable (<a href="../bible/joh015.htm#vrs22">John 15:22, 24</a>). He worked miracles to establish the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a> (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm">Matthew 12</a>; <a href="../bible/luk011.htm">Luke 11</a>), gave to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs8">Matthew 10:8</a>) and <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> (<a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs9">Luke 10:9, 19</a>) the power of working miracles, thereby instructing them to follow the same method, and promised that the <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">gift of miracles</a> should persist in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs17">Mark 16:17</a>). At the sight of His marvellous works, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (<a href="../bible/mat009.htm#vrs8">Matthew 9:8</a>), <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs2">John 3:2</a>), and the man born blind (<a href="../bible/joh009.htm#vrs33">John 9:33</a>) confess that they must be ascribed to Divine power.

<p>Pfleiderer accepts the <a href="../bible/mar000.htm">second Gospel</a> as the <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authentic</a> work of <a href="../cathen/09674a.htm">St. Mark</a>, and this Gospel is a compact account of miracles wrought by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Ewald and Weiss speak of the miracles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as a daily task. Miracles are not accidental or external to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>; they are inseparably bound up with His <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> life &#151; a life and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which is the fulfillment of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and the source of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> civilization. Miracles form the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of the Gospel narratives, so that, if removed, there would remain no recognizable plan of work and no intelligent portrait of the worker. We have the same evidence for miracles that we have for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Dr. Holtzmann says that the very traits whose astonishing combination in one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> presents the highest kind of historical evidence for His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> are indissolubly connected with miracles. Unless we accept miracles, we have no Gospel history. Admit that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> wrought many miracles, or confess that we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him at all &#151; in fact, that He never existed. The historical <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> stands before us remarkable in the charm of <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, extraordinary in the elevation of life and beauty of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, strikingly consistent in tenor of life, exercising Divine power in varied ways and at every turn. He rises supreme over, and apart from, His surroundings and cannot be regarded as the fruit of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> invention or as the product of the age. The simplest clearest, only explanation is that the testimony is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. They who deny have yet to offer an explanation strong enough to withstand the criticism of the <a href="../cathen/13516b.htm">sceptics</a> themselves.

<p>(3) The testimony of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> to miracles is twofold: <ul><li>They preached the miracles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, especially the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. Thus St. Peter speaks of the "miracles, and wonders, and signs" which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> did as a fact well-known to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs22">Acts 2:22</a>), and as published through <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> and <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#vrs37">Acts 10:37</a>). The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> profess themselves <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs32">Acts 2:32</a>), they say that the characteristic of an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> is that he be a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs22">Acts 1:22</a>), and upon the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> base their preaching in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/act003.htm#vrs15">Acts 3:15</a>; <a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs10">4:10</a>; <a href="../bible/act005.htm#vrs30">5:30</a>, <a href="../bible/act010.htm#vrs40">10:40</a>), at Antioch (<a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs30">Acts 13:30 sqq.</a>), at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> (<a href="../bible/act017.htm#vrs31">Acts 17:31</a>), at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>), at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#vrs1">Romans 6:1</a>), and in <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a> (<a href="../bible/1th001.htm#vrs10">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>). <li>They worked miracles themselves, wonders and signs in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs43">Acts 2:43</a>), cure the lame (<a href="../bible/act003.htm#vrs14">Acts 3:14</a>), heal the sick, and drive out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> (<a href="../bible/act008.htm#vrs7">Acts 8:7-8</a>), raise the dead (<a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs10">Acts 20:10 sqq.</a>). <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> calls the attention of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to his own miracles (<a href="../bible/rom015.htm#vrs18">Romans 15:18-19</a>), refers to the well-known miracles performed in Galatia (<a href="../bible/gal003.htm#vrs5">Galatians 3:5</a>), calls the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> the miracles he worked among them as the signs of his <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostleship</a> (<a href="../bible/2co012.htm#vrs12">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>), and gives to the working of miracles a place in the economy of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> (<a href="../bible/1co012.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>). Thus the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> worked miracles in their missionary journeys in virtue of the power given them by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs15">Mark 3:15</a>) and confirmed after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs17">Mark 16:17</a>).</ul>

<p>(4) Dr. Middleton holds that all miracles ceased with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Mozley and Milman ascribe later miracles to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> myths, <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>. Trench admits that few points present greater difficulty than the attempt to determine the exact period when the power of working miracles was withdrawn from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This position is one of polemical bias against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, just as presumptions of various kinds are behind all attacks on the miracles of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scripture</a>.

<p>Now we are not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to accept every miracle alleged as such. The evidence of testimony is our warrant, and for miracles of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> we have testimony of the most complete kind. If it should happen that, after careful investigation, a supposed miracle should turn out to be no miracle at all, a distinct service to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> would be rendered. Throughout the course of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a> there are miracles so well authenticated that their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> cannot be denied.

<ul>
<li>Thus <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">St. Clement of Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">St. Ignatius of Antioch</a> speak of the miracles wrought in their <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.

<li>St. Paulinus, in the life of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, narrates what he has seen.
<li>St. Augustine gives a long list of extraordinary miracles wrought before his own eyes, mentions names and particulars, describes them as well known, and says they happened within two years before he published the written account (<a href="../fathers/120121.htm"><em>City of God</em> XXI.8</a>; Retract., I, xiii).
<li><a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> wrote a book to confute Vigilantius and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> should be <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a>, by citing miracles wrought through them.

</ul>

<p>Hence Gibbon says, "The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, has claimed an uninterrupted succession of miraculous powers, the <a href="../cathen/14776c.htm">gift of tongues</a>, of <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> and of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, the power of expelling demons, of healing the sick and of raising the dead" (Decline and Fall, I, pp. 264, 288), thus miracles are so interwoven with our religion, so connected with its origin, its promulgation its progress and whole history, that it is impossible to separate them from it. The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> on earth, in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> abide, rendered illustrious by the miraculous lives of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of all countries and all times, is a perpetual standing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> for the reality of miracles (<a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, "De notis eccl.", LIV, xiv). The well-attested records are to be found in the official Processes for the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Mozley held that an enormous distinction exists between the miracles of the Gospel and those of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, through the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> notion that the sole purpose of miracles was the attestation of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> denies the contention and shows that both are of the same type and as well-authenticated by historical evidence.
<h2 id="section7">Place and value of the gospel miracles</h2>

<p>In studying the Gospel miracles we are impressed by the accounts given of their multitude, and by the fact that only a very small proportion of them is related by the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> in detail; the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> speak only in the most general terms of the miracles <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> performed in the great missionary journeys through <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> and <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>. We read that the people, seeing the things which He did, followed Him in crowds (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#vrs25">Matthew 4:25</a>), to the number of 5000 (<a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs14">Luke 9:14</a>) so that He could not enter the cities, and His fame spread from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> through <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> (<a href="../bible/mat004.htm#vrs24">Matthew 4:24</a>). His <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> was so great that the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in council speak of Him as one who "doth many miracles" (<a href="../bible/joh011.htm#vrs47">John 11:47</a>), the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> at <a href="../cathen/05405a.htm">Emmaus</a> as the "prophet, mighty in work and word before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and all the people" (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs19">Luke 24:19</a>), and St. Peter describes Him to <a href="../cathen/04375b.htm">Cornelius</a> as the wonder-working preacher (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#vrs38">Acts 10:38</a>). Out of the great mass of miraculous events surrounding <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> person, the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> made a selection. <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">True</a>, it was impossible to narrate all (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs30">John 20:30</a>). Yet we can see in the narrated miracles a twofold reason for the selection.

<p>(1) The great purpose of the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a> was the manifestation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> through the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life</a> and work of His <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Incarnate Son</a>. Thus it ranks supreme among the works of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">God's Providence</a> over men.

<p>This explains the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life</a> and teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; it enables us to grasp the scope and plan of His miracles. They can be considered in relation to the office and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as Redeemer. Thus <ul>
<li>they have their source in the <a href="../cathen/07610b.htm">hypostatic union</a> and follow on the relation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to men as Redeemer. In them we can see references to the great <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> work He came to accomplish. Hence the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> conceive <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> miraculous power as an influence radiating from Him (<a href="../bible/mar005.htm#vrs30">Mark 5:30</a>; <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#vrs19">Luke 6:19</a>), and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> call the miracles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> theandrical works.
<li>Their aim is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the manifestation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men, as e.g. in the miracle of <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> (<a href="../bible/joh002.htm#vrs11">John 2:11</a>), in the <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">Transfiguration</a> (<a href="../bible/mat017.htm">Matthew 17</a>), the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">Resurrection</a> of <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> (<a href="../bible/joh011.htm#vrs15">John 11:15</a>), <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> last <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/joh017.htm">John 17</a>), the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#vrs40">Acts 10:40</a>). St. John opens his <a href="../bible/joh001.htm">Gospel</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of the Eternal Word and adds, "we saw his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>" (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs14">John 1:14</a>). Hence <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103500.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> V</a>) and <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> (Incarn.) teach that the works of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> were the manifestations of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Divine Word</a> who in the beginning made all things and who in the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> displayed His power over <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as a manifestation of the new life imparted to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> of the character and purposes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The repeated references in the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts</a> and in the Epistles to the "glory of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>" have relation to His miracles. The source and purpose of the miracles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the reason for their intimate connection with His <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life</a> and teaching. A saving and redeeming mission was the purpose of the miracles, as it was of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.
<li>Their motive was mercy. Most of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> miracles were works of mercy. They were performed not with a view to awe men by the feeling of <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>, but to show compassion for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> and suffering <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">humanity</a>. They are not to be regarded as isolated or transitory acts of sympathy, but as prompted by a deep and abiding mercy which characterizes the office of Saviour. The <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a> is a work of mercy, and the miracles reveal the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the works of His <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Incarnate Son</a> (<a href="../bible/act010.htm#vrs38">Acts 10:38</a>).
<li>Hence we can see in them a symbolical character. They were signs, and in a special sense they signified by the typical language of external facts, the inward renewal of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Thus, in commenting on the miracle of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> son at <a href="../cathen/10672b.htm">Naim</a>, St. Augustine says that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> raised three from the death of the body, but thousands from the death of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to the life of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> (Serm. de verbis Dom., xcviii, al. xliv).</ul>

<p>The relief which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> brought to the body represented the deliverance He was working on <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. His miracles of cures and healings were the visible picture of His spiritual work in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. These miracles, summarized in the answer of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to the messengers of John (<a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs5">Matthew 11:5</a>), are explained by the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a> with reference to the ills of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (<a href="../summa/4044.htm#article0">ST III:44</a>). The motive and meaning of the miracles explain the moderation <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> showed in the use of His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> power. Repose in strength is a sublime trait in the <a href="../cathen/08382a.htm">character of Jesus</a>; it comes from the <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">conscious</a> possession of power to be used for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> of men. Rousseau confesses "All the miracles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> were useful without pomp or display, but simple as His words, His <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life</a>, His whole conduct" (Lettr. de la Montag., pt. I, lett. iii). He does not perform them for the sake of being a mere worker of miracles. Everything He does has a meaning when viewed in the relation <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> holds to men. In the class known as miracles of power <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> does not show a mere <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> superiority over ordinary men. In virtue of His redeeming mission He <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a> that He is Lord and Master of the forces of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Thus by a word He stills the tempest, by a word He multiplied a few loaves and fishes so that thousands feasted and were filled, by a word He healed <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, drove out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, raised the dead to <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, and finally set the great seal upon His mission by rising from death, as He had explicitly foretold. Thus Renan admits that "even the marvellous in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> is but sober <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> sense compared with that which we meet in the Jewish <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> writings or the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> or <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> mythologies" (Stud. in Hist. of Relig., pp. 177 203).

<p>Hence the miracles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> have a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> import. They have a vital connection with His teaching and mission, illustrate the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and purpose of His kingdom, and show a connection with some of the greatest doctrines and principles of His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Its catholicity is shown in the miracles of the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion's</a> servant (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm">Matthew 8</a>) and the Syro-phoenician <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> (<a href="../bible/mar007.htm">Mark 7</a>). The Sabbatical miracles reveal its purpose, i.e., the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men, and show that <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Christ's kingdom</a> marks the passing of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Dispensation</a>. His miracles teach the power of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the answer given to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The central <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His teaching was life. He came to give life to men, and this teaching is emphasized by raising the dead to <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, especially in the case of <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> and His own <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacramental</a> teaching of the miracles is manifested in the miracle of <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> (<a href="../bible/joh002.htm">John 2</a>), in the cure of the paralytic, to show he had the power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> [and he used this power (<a href="../bible/mat009.htm">Matthew 9</a>) and gave it to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs23">John 20:23</a>) ], in the multiplication of the loaves (<a href="../bible/joh006.htm">John 6</a>) and in raising the dead. Finally, the prophetic element of the fortunes of the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is shown in the miracles of stilling the tempest, of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> on the waters, of the draught of fishes, of the didrachma and the barren fig tree. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> makes the miracle of <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a> the type of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">General Resurrection</a>, just as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> take the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a> to signify the rising of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the death of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to the life of grace, and to be a pledge and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of the victory over <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death and of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">final resurrection</a> (<a href="../bible/1th004.htm">1 Thessalonians 4</a>).

<p>(2) The miracles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> have an evidential value. This aspect naturally follows from the above considerations. In the first miracle at <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> He "manifested His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>", therefore the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> "believed in Him" (<a href="../bible/joh002.htm#vrs11">John 2:11</a>). <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> constantly appealed to His "works" as evidences of His mission and His divinity. He declares that His miracles have greater evidential value than the testimony of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#vrs36">John 5:36</a>); their <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> force as evidences is expressed by <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs2">John 3:2</a>). And to the miracles <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> adds the evidence of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> (<a href="../bible/joh005.htm#vrs31">John 5:31</a>). Now their value as evidences for the people then living is found not only in the display of <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a> in His redeeming mission but also in the multitude of His works. Thus the unrecorded miracles had an evidential bearing on His mission. So we can see an evidential reason for the selection of the miracles as narrated in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>.

<ul><li>This selection was guided by a purpose to make clear the main events in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life</a> leading up to the Crucifixion and to show that certain definite miracles (e.g., the cure of the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, the casting out of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> in a manner marvelously superior to the <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcisms</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the Sabbatical miracles, the raising of <a href="../cathen/09096a.htm">Lazarus</a>) <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">Synagogue</a> to conspire and put Him to death. <li>A second reason for the selection was the expressed purpose to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs31">John 20:31</a>).</ul>

<p>Thus, for us, who depend on the Gospel narratives, the evidential value of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> miracles comes from a comparatively small number related in detail, though of a most stupendous and clearly <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> kind, some of which were performed almost in private and followed by the strictest injunctions not to publish them. In considering them as evidences in relation to us now living, we may add to them the constant reference to the multitude of miracles unrecorded in detail, their intimate connection with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord's</a> teaching and <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life</a>, their relation to the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, their own prophetic character as fulfilled in the development of His kingdom on earth.
<h2 id="section8">Special providences</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> is a great fact, which finds expression in a persistent manner and enters intimately into the life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">humanity</a>. So universal is the act of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that it seems an <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> and part of our being. It is the fundamental fact of religion, and religion is a universal phenomenon of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> teaches that in his spiritual <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is made to the image and likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> instinctively turns to his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Maker</a> in aspirations of worship, of <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a>.

<p>The real value of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> has been a vital subject for discussion in modern times. Some hold that its value lies only in its being a factor in the culture of the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> life, by giving tone and strength to <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>. Thus Professor Tyndall, in his famous Belfast address, proposed this view, maintaining that modern <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the physical value of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to be unbelievable (Fragments of Science). He based his contention on the uniformity of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. But this basis is now no longer held as an obstacle to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for physical benefits. Others, like Baden-Powell (Order of Nature) admit that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> answers <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for spiritual favours, but denies its value for physical effects. But his basis is the same as that of Tyndall, and besides an answer for spiritual benefits is in fact an interference on the part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.

<p>Now <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> teaches that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in answer to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> confers not only spiritual favours but at times interferes with the ordinary course of physical phenomena, so that, as a result, particular events happen otherwise than they should. This interference takes place in miracles and special providences.

<p>When we kneel to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> we do not always beg <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to work miracles or that our lives shall be constant prodigies of His power. The sense of our littleness gives an <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and reverential spirit to our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. We <a href="../cathen/15072a.htm">trust</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through His <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">Infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and power, will in some way best known to Him bring about what we ask. Hence, by special providences we mean events which happen in the course of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and of <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> through the instrumentality of natural <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. We cannot discern either in the event itself or in the manner of its happening any deviation from the known course of things. What we do <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, however, is that events shape themselves in response to our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are invariable, yet one important factor must not be forgotten: that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> may produce an effect, the same <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> must be present. If the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> vary, then the effects also vary. By altering the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a>, other tendencies of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> are made predominant, and the forces which otherwise would work out their effects yield to stronger forces. In this way our will interferes with the workings of natural forces and with human tendencies, as is shown in our intercourse with men and in the science of government.

<p>Now, if such power rests with men, can <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> do less? Can we not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that, at our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may cause the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of natural phenomena so to combine that, through His special agency, we may obtain our heart's desire and yet so that, to the ordinary observer, the event happens in its ordinary place and <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. To the devout <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, however, all is different. He recognizes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> favour and is devoutly thankful for the fatherly care. He knows that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has brought the event about in some way. When, therefore, we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for rain or to avert a calamity, or to prevent the ravages of plague, we beg not so much for miracles or signs of <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>: we ask that He who holds the heavens in His hands and who searches the abyss will listen to our petitions and, in His own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> way, bring about the answer we need.
