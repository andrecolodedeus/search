<h1>Miraculous Medal</h1>  

<p>The devotion commonly known as that of the Miraculous Medal owes its origin to Zoe Labore, a member of the Daughters of Charity of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, known in religion as Sister Catherine [<em>Note:</em> She was subsequently <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>], to whom the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a> appeared three separate times in the year 1830, at the mother-house of the community at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The first of these apparitions occurred 18 July, the second 27 November, and the third a short time later. On the second occasion, Sister Catherine records that the Blessed Virgin appeared as if standing on a globe, and bearing a globe in her hands. As if from rings set with precious stones dazzling rays of light were emitted from her fingers. These, she said, were symbols of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> which would be bestowed on all who asked for them. Sister Catherine adds that around the figure appeared an oval frame bearing in golden letters the words "O Mary, conceived without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us who have recourse to thee"; on the back appeared the letter M, surmounted by a cross, with a crossbar beneath it, and under all the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, the former surrounded by a crown of thorns, and the latter pierced by a sword.

<p>At the second and third of these visions a command was given to have a <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medal</a> struck after the model revealed, and a promise of great <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> was made to those who wear it when blessed. After careful investigation, M. Aladel, the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a> of Sister Catherine, obtained the approval of Mgr. de Quelen, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and on 30 June, 1832, the first <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medals</a> were struck and with their distribution the devotion spread rapidly. One of the most remarkable facts recorded in connection with the Miraculous Medal is the conversion of a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>, <a href="../cathen/12659a.htm">Alphonse Ratisbonne</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, who had resisted the appeals of a friend to enter the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/12659a.htm">M. Ratisbonne</a> consented, somewhat reluctantly, to wear the <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medal</a>, and being in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he entered, by chance, the church of Sant' Andrea delle Fratte and beheld in a vision the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> exactly as she is represented on the <a href="../cathen/10111b.htm">medal</a>; his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> speedily followed. This fact has received <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> sanction, and is recorded in the office of the feast of the Miraculous Medal. In 1847, M. Etienne, superior-general of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Congregation of the Mission</a>, obtained from <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a> the privilege of establishing in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the Sisters of Charity a confraternity under the title of the Immaculate Conception, with all the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> attached to a similar <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> established for its students at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. This confraternity adopted the Miraculous Medal as its badge, and the members, known as the Children of Mary, wear it attached to a blue ribbon. On 23 July, 1894, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>, after a careful examination of all the facts by the Sacred Congregation of Rites, instituted a feast, with a special <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Office</a> and <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a>, of the Manifestation of the Immaculate Virgin under the title of the Miraculous Medal, to be celebrated yearly on 27 November by the Priests of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Congregation of the Mission</a>, under the rite of a double of the second class. For ordinaries and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities who may ask the privilege of celebrating the festival, its rank is to be that of a double major feast. A further <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 7 September, 1894, permits any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to say the Mass proper to the feast in any <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> attached to a house of the Sisters of Charity.
