<h1>Missionaries of the Company of Mary</h1>  

<p>The Company of Mary was founded by <a href="../cathen/09384a.htm">Blessed Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort</a> in 1713. As early as 1700 Montfort had conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of founding a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of missionaries. Five months after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, Nov., 1700, he wrote: "I am continually asking in my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for a poor and small company of good <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to preach missions and retreats under the standard and protection of the Blessed Virgin". For many years he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> and caused others to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the realization of his project. In 1713 he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> with a view to recruit members for his community. The director of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> Du St-Esprit promised to send him such young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> as would feel called to do missionary work. During the intervals between his missions Montfort wrote the Rule of the Company of Mary (1713). When he died in 1716, two young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, Father Vatel and Father Mulot, and a few lay-brothers whom Montfort had associated with himself during his missions, were the only tangible result of his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, travels and austerities. Nevertheless the founder felt confident that his company was to develop at the time marked by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, and addressing his little flock, he bade them not to fear or lose <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>.

<p>From 1718 till 1781 the "Montfortists", although few in number, gave over 430 missions, most of which lasted a month. Continuing their founders fight against <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>, they preached the tender mercies of the <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">Divine Heart</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Crucified. They exhorted people to renew their <a href="../cathen/02275a.htm">baptismal vows</a>. Above all, they strove to draw the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to Jesus Christ through <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Blessed Virgin</a>. They promoted everywhere the daily recital of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>. Through their preaching, La Vend&eacute;e and Brittany were kept free from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> Vendeans were strengthened for their heroic struggle, as has been asserted by the fathers of the <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> (1868). Three <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and four brothers of the Company of Mary shared the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> death with the Vendean heroes. Montfort's community, debilitated by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, was reorganized by Father Deshayes, elected general in 1821. He received from <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> a brief of praise for the Company of Mary and for the <a href="../cathen/15668a.htm">Daughters of Wisdom</a>. P&egrave;re Dalin (1837-1855) obtained canonical <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of both congregations. Hitherto the missionaries had but one residence, the mother-house at St Laurentsur-S&ecirc;vre. During P&egrave;re Dalin's administration as general, several establishments were made in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Under P&egrave;re Denis (1855-1877) the community accepted at Pont-Ch&acirc;teau, <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Diocese of Nantes</a>, the direction of a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> destined to furnish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to Haiti. P&egrave;re Denis also sent several of his missionaries and brothers to Haiti. This was the company's first attempt at foreign missions.

<p>So far the missionaries had been recruited from the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. This mode being too uncertain, too slow and more or less prejudicial to that unity of spirit which ought to characterize a religious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, P&egrave;re Denis established a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in which boys, called to the missionary life, should be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by and for the company. Together with the foreign missions and the foundation of mission <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, what hastened the spreading of the company was the expulsion of the religious from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1880 and 1901. In 1880 the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> took refuge in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, where a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and a scholasticate were established. In 1883, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was also begun at Schimmert. The year 1883 saw the establishment of the first house in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. After the election of P&egrave;re Maurille as general, in 1887, the membership of the community doubled. The Beatification of Montfort, in 1888, gave a new stimulus to the company's expansion. In <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and a scholasticate were founded near Ottawa (1890); a mission <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Papineauville (Quebec), in 1900; in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, a scholasticate; several missions in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. In 1901 the company took charge of the Vicariate Apostolic of Nyassa Land (<a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>), which numbers at present 1 <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, 20 missionaries and 600 converts.

<p>P&egrave;re L'Houmeau's (1903) administration as general has been marked by the foundation of two residences in the <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Diocese of Brooklyn</a>: Port Jefferson and Ozone Park (1904); the foundation of the Vicariate Apostolic of San Martino (Columbia, South America) having 1 <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, 12 fathers and a few brothers; the sending to Iceland of 2 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 2 brothers (1903), the only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries now evangelizing that country; several establishments in <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a>; the definite <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the Constitutions in 1904; the division of the congregation into provinces; the acquisition of the Diocese of Port de Paix (Haiti), and the transfer of the French mission <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> to Romsey, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (1910). The company actually numbers about 500 members. The <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the American province resides in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>. The initials S. M. M. which the missionaries affix to their signature are an abbreviation of "Societatis Mari&aelig; a Montfort", of the Company of Mary (founded) by Montfort.
