<h1>Missionaries of the Sacred Heart of Jesus</h1>  

<p>(Issoudun).

<p>A religious congregation of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> with the object of promoting the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and practice of devotion to the Heart of Jesus as embodied in the revelations of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> to Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque, and of offering personal reparation to the Divine Heart. The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society's</a> motto is, "Ametur ubique terrarum Cor Jesu Sacratissimum" (May the most Sacred Heart of Jesus be <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> everywhere). It was founded at Issoudun, in the <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Archdiocese of Bourges</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, by the Abb&eacute; Jules Chevalier. Until very recent years the mother house was in the above-named town, but since the separation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> has its headquarters in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The origin of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart is closely connected with the Papal definition of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Immaculate Conception of the B. V. M., the means to lay their foundation being the outcome of special <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> addressed to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> during the nine days preceding the great religious event of 8 Dec., 1854. The founder had pledged himself to honor the Blessed Virgin in a special manner. He redeemed his promise the following year by erecting a shrine dedicated to the honor of the Blessed Virgin under the title of "Our Lady of the Sacred Heart ".

<p>In 1864 an association of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was founded which has since been honored with the official title of Universal Archconfraternity of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, and enriched with numerous <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. The central governing body is at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, with local directors in various countries. The official centre for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> is at Watertown, New York; those for other English-speaking countries are at <a href="../cathen/06579a.htm">Glastonbury</a>, Somerset, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; Sydney, New South Wales, and <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society's</a> first house in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was founded, and an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> college opened, in 1909.

<p>On 2 Oct. 1867, an apostolic school was founded by Father Vandel at Chezal-Benoit in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, with twelve pupils. It grew and prospered, and in course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> other similar institutions arose in different countries. From these the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> are chiefly recruited. The work is represented in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> by St. Joseph's Apostolic School at Watertown, N. Y.

<p>The personnel of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is composed of 825 professed religious, with provincial houses in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, and a Provincial Superior residing in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, who rules over the dispersed members of the French Province, and its establishments in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>; <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>; <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> &#151; Quebec; Beauport, <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a>; South Qu'Appelle, Medicine Hat, <a href="../cathen/13482b.htm">Saskatchewan</a>, and North Cobalt, Ont.

<p>The Fathers at Quebec direct the Archconfraternity of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, publish the Annals, its monthly bulletin, and conduct five missions and retreats. They also have a public <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> for <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and the States is at Beauport. The other <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> communities are engaged in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> and missionary work. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, besides Glastonbury, the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart have communities at <a href="../cathen/13329a.htm">St. Albans</a>, Herfordshire, and at Braintree, Essex. They engage in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work and act as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the Society has communities at Watertown, N. Y.; Natick, R. I.; Onawa and <a href="../cathen/14016a.htm">Sioux City</a>, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>; Cazenovia, Wis., this last being a dependency of the German Province; the first four form an American Quasi-Province with headquarters at Natick. In all these places the Fathers have charge of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, except those at <a href="../cathen/14016a.htm">Sioux City</a>, who preach missions, supply the places of absent <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and assist the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The Natick community supplies <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> to St. Joseph's Hospital for tubercular patients at Hills Grove, and to the Rhode Island State charitable and correctional institutions at Howard, Cranston, and Sackanosset.

<p>For the past quarter of a century the efforts of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart have been expended chiefly in foreign mission fields. On 1 Sept., 1881, three Fathers set out from Barcelona for the South Sea Islands at the request of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, and established a station in New Britain &#151; now <a href="../cathen/11017a.htm">New Pomerania</a>. Today the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and brothers doing missionary work in divers islands and archipelagos of the South Pacific number upward of 300, exclusive of the new mission lately opened in Mindanao, <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a> &#151; where thirty or more apostolic laborers from the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Province are already employed &#151; and the vast territory comprised in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/12312b.htm">Port Victoria</a> and Palmerston, South Australia, in charge of Father F. X. Gsell as Administrator Apostolic, with residence at Port Darwin. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ponso-Alegre has just entrusted the direction of his episcopal college to the congregation.
