<h1>Missionary Society of St. Paul the Apostle</h1>  

<p>Otherwise known as the "Paulist Fathers"</p>

<p>A community of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for giving <a href="../cathen/10391a.htm">missions</a> and doing other Apostolic works, especially for making converts to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. It was founded in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and in New York, in 1858, by <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Father Isaac Thomas Hecker</a>, with whom were associated <a href="../cathen/07309b.htm">Augustine F. Hewit</a>, <a href="../cathen/04750b.htm">George Deshon</a>, <a href="../cathen/02213a.htm">Francis A. Baker</a>, and Clarence A. Walworth. All of these had been members of the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer</a>, and owing to certain misunderstandings had been suspected of disloyalty to their order and accused of disobedience.

<p>In order to set matters right and to explain their case to the superior general, <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Father Hecker</a> went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and on 29 August, 1857, three days after his arrival, was expelled from the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>. This action was appealed to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and was not approved. <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Father Hecker</a> and the above named <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were then at their own request dispensed from their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and proceeded to form the new community. <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Hecker</a> received letters from <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, strongly recommending him and his associated to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. This is the official origin of the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulists</a>.

<p>But long before this, however, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> gave <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Father Hecker</a> distinct and unmistakable intimations &#151; to use his own words &#151; that he was "set apart to undertake in some leading and conspicuous way the conversion of this country". He adds that he "made an explicit statement of these <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> visitations to various <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, singly and in common, always under compulsion of obedience or necessity". These advisers included Cardinal Barnabo, the Prefect of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> at this time, and several of the most approved directors of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. They unanimously decided that he acted wisely in following his interior <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> guidance.

<p>During the summer of 1858 a practical beginning of their apostolate was made by the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulists</a> in New York, to which diocese they were made heartily welcome by <a href="../cathen/07516a.htm">Archbishop John Hughes</a>. He gave them a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in what was then a suburb and is now the heart of the city. As they had given missions as <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> in all parts of the country, they were well and favourably known to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and were very popular with the people. They were all men of ability, quite above the ordinary <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> standard, powerful preachers, and of mature spirituality. <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Father Hecker</a> especially was known as a remarkable man, a leader in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> thought, of profoundly interior spirit of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, joined to such a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> as characterizes only the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. They were all Americans and all converts, and under their founder's inspiration, they soon developed their high gifts of preaching, of writing, and of the guidance of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. To provide a house and church the new community, having but a handful of parishioners, appealed to their friends everywhere for financial help. The response was generous, and they built in West 59th Street, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and church combined, which in later years, when the present church was erected, was used wholly for their dwelling. This is the mother-house. In course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> foundations were made in <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a> and Berkeley, <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>; <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, Illinois; Winchester, <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a>; and Austin, <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and house of studies is in Washington, D.C., the scholastic training being affiliated to the courses of the <a href="../cathen/03455a.htm">Catholic University</a>.

<p>A programme of rule was drawn up at the time of the founding of the community, in 1858, and approved by <a href="../cathen/07516a.htm">Archbishop Hughes</a>. This served all needful purposes for twenty years, when it was much enlarged. It is still in process of experiment before being presented to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for canonical <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>. Its spiritual features are substantially the same routine of devout exercises, in private and in common, observed by the original fathers while <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>. Although the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulists</a> do not make <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of religion, they undertake to observe the evangelical counsels as fervently as if canonically bound to do so. This is expressed in the formula of profession as a "whole-hearted determination to obey the rules, to aspire after <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">Christian and religious perfection</a>, to devote oneself energetically to the labours of the Apostolic ministry, and to persevere in the same vocation to the end of life". The training of the members is provided for in the exercises of the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and house of studies. Permanency in the community is secured by this original training, and the act of profession witnesses to a well matured purpose of striving after perfection and to a sincere <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of community life. To this bond of union is joined that of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> actuating the members of the institute individually and in common. <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Father Hecker's</a> estimate of the fundamental principle of the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulist</a> life is as follows: "The desire for personal perfection is the foundation stone of a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community; when this fails, it crumbles to pieces." And again: "The main purpose of each <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulist</a> must be the attainment of personal perfection by the practice of those virtues without which it cannot be secured &#151; interior fidelity to grace, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, detachment and the like."

<p>In the external order, the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulist</a> vocation is primarily, as was the original vocation of <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Father Hecker</a>, the conversion of non-Catholics. It embraces all branches of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> apostolate, lecturing and preaching, printing and distribution of missionary literature, and private conference with earnest inquirers. The spread of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> holds the first place both in their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and in their active life; it outranks in importance all other external labours. It is on this account that <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulists</a> are most commonly known both in and out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as convert makers. Missions for non-Catholics are systematically given being very often joined to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missions, though not seldom given separately. The effects of this apostolate have justified <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Father Hecker's</a> lifelong contention that America is a ripe field for the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries. Many thousands of converts have been made, some immediately, more after prolonged examination of the claims of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and multitudes of half-hearted and indifferent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have been restored to the practice of their religion, a result which so invariably follows these lectures as to give them a very high place in the work of "stopping the leaks".

<p>In the year 1894, the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulists</a> introduced missions to non-Catholics among the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, beginning with the <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Diocese of Cleveland</a>. This work has now been extended into over twenty-five American <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and also into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and Australia. The number of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> actively engaged in these <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> apostolates is very considerable. For the training, and in many cases for the support, of these bands of convert-makers, members of the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulist</a> community brought about the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/03453c.htm">Catholic Missionary Union</a>, a corporation whose board of directors is controlled by members of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>. Under its direction, but administered wholly by <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulists</a>, the Apostolic Mission House was opened on the Catholic University grounds, Washington, D.C., in 1903, and from its classes most of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> missionaries have been recruited. The present <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> wrote to Cardinal Gibbons a letter of approval of this institution in September, 1908.

<p>With the same end in view the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulists</a> have vigorously engaged in the apostolate of the press. The first fathers printed and circulated their sermons in the earliest years of the community, and in 1865 <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Father Hecker</a> started the "Catholic World Magazine", then the only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> monthly in the country; and this was immediately followed by an organized propaganda of missionary books, pamphlets, and tracts, most of which were either distributed to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> <em>gratis</em> or disposed of at nominal prices &#151; a work highly praised by the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, and still energetically carried on. The Paulist Fathers also consider it part of their vocation to influence the secular press in the interests of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The preaching of missions to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> also has engaged much of the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulist</a>.

<p>No innovation of traditional <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> methods, least of all on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> spirit, has ever been observed in their public utterances or ministrations, though the personal tone and character of the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulists</a> has imparted to their discourses and writings a peculiar zest. Parish work has occupied many members of the institute, characterized by special care in preparing and preaching sermons, the training of children, the relief of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, the beauty and dignity of ceremonial, and the proper rendering of the official music of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The making of converts is a prominent feature of their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> activities. Constant endeavours are made to attract non-Catholics to the sermons and the public services of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as well as to private conference, and converts are always under instruction.

<p>The number of <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulists</a> is now 67, of those not yet <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, 23. The increase, though not numerically great, has been continuous, the larger number of the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> being attracted by the non-Catholic missions.
