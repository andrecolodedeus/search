<h1>Mithraism</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> religion consisting mainly of the cult of the ancient Indo-Iranian Sun-god Mithra. It entered <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> from <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> after Alexander's conquest, spread rapidly over the whole Roman Empire at the beginning of our era, reached its zenith during the third century, and vanished under the repressive regulations of <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> at the end of the fourth century. Of late the researches of Cumont have brought it into prominence mainly because of its supposed similarity to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.
<h2>Origin</h2>

<p>The origin of the cult of Mithra dates from the time that the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a> and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> still formed one people, for the god Mithra occurs in the religion and the sacred books of both races, i.e. in the Vedas and in the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a>. In <a href="../cathen/15318a.htm">Vedic</a> <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> he is frequently mentioned and is nearly always coupled with Varuna, but beyond the bare occurrence of his name, little is known of him (Rigveda, III, 59). It is conjectured (Oldenberg, "Die "Religion des Veda," Berlin, 1894) that Mithra was the rising sun, Varuna the setting sun; or, Mithra, the sky at daytime, Varuna, the sky at night; or, the one the sun, the other the moon. In any case Mithra is a light or solar deity of some sort; but in vedic times the vague and general mention of him seems to indicate that his name was little more than a memory. In the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a> he is much more of a living and ruling deity than in Indian <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; nevertheless, he is not only secondary to <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a>, but he does not belong to the seven Amshaspands or personified virtues which immediately surround <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura</a>; he is but a Yazad, a popular demigod or genius. The <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a> however gives us his position only after the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrian</a> reformation; the inscriptions of the Achaemenidae (seventh to fourth century B.C.) assign him a much higher place, naming him immediately after <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a> and associating him with the goddess Anaitis (Anahata), whose name sometimes precedes his own. Mithra is the god of light, Anaitis the goddess of water. Independently of the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrian</a> reform, Mithra retained his place as foremost deity in the north-west of the Iranian highlands. After the conquest of Babylon this Persian cult came into contact with Chaldean <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a> and with the national worship of Marduk. For a time the two priesthoods of Mithra and Marduk (magi and chaldaei respectively) coexisted in the capital and Mithraism borrowed much from this intercourse. This modified Mithraism traveled farther north-westward and became the State cult of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. Its rulers, anxious to claim descent from the glorious kings of the past, adopted Mithradates as their royal name (so five kings of <a href="../cathen/06460a.htm">Georgia</a>, and Eupator of the Bosporus). Mithraism then entered <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, especially <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> and Cappadocia. Here it came into contact with the Phrygian cult of Attis and Cybele from which it adopted a number of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and practices, though apparently not the gross obscenities of the Phrygian worship. This Phrygian-Chaldean-Indo-Iranian religion, in which the Iranian element remained predominant, came, after Alexander's conquest, in touch with the Western World. Hellenism, however, and especially Greece itself, remained remarkably free from its influence. When finally the Romans took possession of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/11666a.htm">Pergamum</a>, occupied <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> and stationed two legions of soldiers on the Euphrates, the success of Mithraism in the West was secured. It spread rapidly from the Bosporus to the Atlantic, from <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a> to Britain. Its foremost apostles were the legionaries; hence it spread first to the frontier stations of the Roman army.

<p>Mithraism was emphatically a soldier religion: Mithra, its hero, was especially a divinity of fidelity, manliness, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a>; the stress it laid on good fellowship and brotherliness, its exclusion of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and the secret bond amongst its members have suggested the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that Mithraism was <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Masonry</a> amongst the Roman soldiery. At the same time Eastern slaves and foreign tradesmen maintained its propaganda in the cities. When <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a>, coming from King Tiridates of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, had worshipped in <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> an emanation of Mithra, the emperor wished to be initiated in their mysteries. As Mithraism passed as a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Phrygian cult it began to share in the official recognition which Phrygian worship had long enjoyed in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Emperor Commodus</a> was publicly initiated. Its greatest devotee however was the imperial son of a priestess of the sun-god at <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> in Pannonia, <a href="../cathen/15256b.htm">Valerian</a>, who according to the testimony of Flavius Vopiscus, never forgot the cave where his mother initiated him. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he established a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of sun <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and his <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> bear the legend "Sol, Dominus Imperii Romani". <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, Galerius, and Licinius built at Carnuntum on the Danube a temple to Mithra with the dedication: "Fautori Imperii Sui". But with the triumph of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> Mithraism came to a sudden end. Under <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> it had with other <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> cults a short revival. The <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> lynched George the Arian, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city, for attempting to build a church over a Mithras cave near the town. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius I</a> signed its death warrant. The <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a> walled up their sacred caves; and Mithra has no <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> to rival the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who died for Christ.
<h2>Doctrine</h2>

<p>The first principle or highest God was according to Mithraism "Infinite Time"; this was called <em>Aion</em> or Saeculum, <em>Kronos</em> or Saturnus. This Kronos is none other than Zervan, an ancient Iranian conception, which survived the sharp <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> of Zoroaster; for Zervan was father of both <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ormuzd and Ahriman</a> and connected the two opposites in a higher unity and was still worshipped a thousand years later by the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichees</a>. This personified Time, ineffable, sexless, passionless, was represented by a human monster, with the head of a lion and a serpent coiled about his body. He carried a sceptre and lightning as sovereign god and held in each hand a key as master of the heavens. He had two pair of wings to symbolize the swiftness of time. His body was covered with zodiacal signs and the emblems of the seasons (i.e. Chaldean <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a> combined with Zervanism). This first principle begat <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and Earth, which in turn begat their son and equal, Ocean. As in the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> legend, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> or Jupiter (Oromasdes) succeeds Kronos. Earth is the Spe&ntilde;ta Armaiti of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> or the Juno of the Westerns, Ocean is Apam-Napat or Neptune. The Persian names were not forgotten, though the Greek and Roman ones were habitually used. <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a> and Spenta Armaiti gave birth to a great number of lesser <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> and heroes: Artagnes (Hercules), Sharevar (Mars), Atar (Vulcan), Anaitis (Cybele), and so on. On the other hand there was Pluto, or <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahriman</a>, also begotten of Infinite Time. The Incarnate Evil rose with the army of darkness to attack and dethrone Oromasdes. They were however thrown back into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, whence they escape, wander over the face of the earth and afflict man. It is man's <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to worship the four simple elements, water and fire, air and earth, which in the main are man's friends. The seven planets likewise were beneficent <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men, which were all created together from the beginning and which at birth had but to descend from the empyrean <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> to the bodies prepared for them, received from the seven planets their passions and characteristics. Hence the seven days of the week were dedicated to the planets, seven metals were sacred to them, seven rites of initiation were made to perfect the <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithraist</a>, and so on. As <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> ever lie in wait for hapless man, he needs a friend and saviour who is Mithra. Mithra was born of a mother-rock by a river under a tree. He came into the world with the Phrygian cap on his head (hence his designation as Pileatus, the Capped One), and a knife in his hand. It is said that shepherds watched his birth, but how this could be, considering there were no men on earth, is not explained. The hero-god first gives battle to the sun, conquers him, crowns him with rays and makes him his eternal friend and fellow; nay, the sun becomes in a sense Mithra's double, or again his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, but <em>Helios Mithras</em> is one god. Then follows the struggle between Mithra and the bull, the central <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of Mithraism. <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a> had created a wild bull which Mithra pursued, overcame, and dragged into his cave. This wearisome journey with the struggling bull towards the cave is the symbol of man's troubles on earth. Unfortunately, the bull escapes from the cave, whereupon <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a> sends a crow with a message to Mithra to find and slay it. Mithra reluctantly obeys, and plunges his dagger into the bull as it returns to the cave. Strange to say, from the body of the dying bull proceeds all wholesome plants and herbs that cover the earth, from his spinal marrow the corn, from his blood the vine, etc. The power of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> sends his unclean creatures to prevent or poison these productions but in vain. From the bull proceed all useful animals, and the bull, resigning itself to death, is transported to the heavenly spheres. Man is now created and subjected to the malign influence of <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahriman</a> in the form of droughts, deluges, and conflagrations, but is saved by Mithra. Finally man is well established on earth and Mithra returns to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. He celebrates a last supper with Helios and his other companions, is taken in his fiery chariot across the ocean, and now in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> protects his followers. For the struggle between <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> continues in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> between the planets and stars, and on earth in the heart of man. Mithra is the Mediator (<em>Mesites</em>) between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man. This function first arose from the fact that as the light-god he is supposed to float midway between the upper <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the earth. Likewise a sun-god, his planet was supposed to hold the central place amongst the seven planets. The moral aspect of his mediation between god and man cannot be proven to be ancient. As Mazdean dualists the Mithraists were strongly inclined towards asceticism; abstention from food and absolute continence seemed to them noble and praiseworthy, though not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>. They battled on Mithra's side against all impurity, against all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> within and without. They believed in the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, sinners after death were dragged off to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>; the just passed through the seven spheres of the planets, through seven gates opening at a mystical word to <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura Mazda</a>, leaving at each planet a part of their lower humanity until, as pure spirits, they stood before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. At the end of the world Mithra will descend to earth on another bull, which he will sacrifice, and mixing its fat with sacred wine he will make all drink the beverage of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. He will thus have proved himself <em>Nabarses</em>, i.e. "never conquered".


<h2>Worship</h2>

<p>There were seven degrees of initiation into the <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithraic</a> mysteries. The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> one (<em>mystes</em>) became in succession crow (<em>corax</em>), occult (<em>cryphius</em>), soldier (<em>miles</em>), lion (<em>leo</em>), Persian (<em>Perses</em>), solar messenger (<em>heliodromos</em>), and father (<em>pater</em>). On solemn occasions they wore a garb appropriate to their name, and uttered sounds or performed gestures in keeping with what they personified. "Some flap their wings as birds imitating the sound of a crow, others roar as lions", says Pseudo-Augustine (Quaest. Vet. N. Test. In P.L., XXXIV, 2214). Crows, occults and soldiers formed the lower orders, a sort of <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>; lions and those admitted to the other degrees were participants of the mysteries. The fathers conducted the worship. The chief of the fathers, a sort of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who always lived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was called "Pater Patrum" or Pater Patratus." The members below the degree of pater called one another "brother," and social distinctions were forgotten in Mithraic unity. The ceremonies of initiation for each degree must have been elaborate, but they are only vaguely known &#151; lustrations and bathings, branding with red-hot metal, anointing with honey, and others. A sacred meal was celebrated of bread and <em>haoma</em> juice for which in the West wine was substituted. This meal was supposed to give the participants super-natural <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The Mithraists worshipped in caves, of which a large number have been found. There were five at <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> alone, but they were small and could perhaps hold at most 200 <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of the cave stood the stone representation of Mithra slaying the bull, a piece of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> usually of mediocre artistic merit and always made after the same Pergamean model. The light usually fell through openings in the top as the caves were near the surface of the ground. A hideous monstrosity representing Kronos was also shown. A fire was kept perpetually burning in the sanctuary. Three times a day <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was offered the sun toward the east, south, or west according to the hour. Sunday was kept holy in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Mithra, and the sixteenth of each month was sacred to him as mediator. The 25 December was observed as his birthday, the <em>natalis invicti</em>, the rebirth of the winter-sun, unconquered by the rigours of the season. A Mithraic community was not merely a religious congregation; it was a social and legal body with its <em>decemprimi, magistri, curatores, defensores,</em> and <em>patroni</em>. These communities allowed no <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as members. <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">Women</a> might console themselves by forming associations to worship Anaitis-Cybele; but whether these were associated with Mithraism seems <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. No <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of immorality or obscene practices, so often connected with esoteric <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> cults, has ever been established against Mithraism; and as far as can be ascertained, or rather conjectured it had an elevating and invigorating effect on its followers. From a chance remark of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (De Praescriptione, xl) we gather that their "Pater Patrum" was only allowed to be married once, and that Mithraism had its <em>virgines</em> and <em>continentes</em>; such at least seems the best interpretation of the passage. If, however, Dieterich's <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithras's</a> liturgy be really a liturgy of this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, as he ably maintains, its liturgy can only strike us as a mixture of bombast and charlatanism in which the <em>mystes</em> has to hold his sides, and roar to the utmost of his power till he is exhausted, to whistle, smack his lips, and pronounce barbaric agglomerations of syllables as the different mystic signs for the heavens and the constellations are unveiled to him.
<h2>Relation to Christianity</h2>

<p>A similarity between Mithra and Christ struck even early observers, such as <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, and in recent times has been urged to prove that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is but an adaptation of Mithraism, or at most the outcome of the same religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and aspirations (e.g. Robertson, "Pagan Christs", 1903). Against this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> and unscientific procedure, which is not endorsed by the greatest living authority on Mithraism, the following considerations must be brought forward.

<p>(1) Our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> regarding Mithraism is very imperfect; some 600 brief inscriptions, mostly dedicatory, some 300 often fragmentary, exiguous, almost identical monuments, a few casual references in the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> or Acts of the Martyrs, and a brief polemic against Mithraism which the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/05739a.htm">Eznig</a> about 450 probably copied from <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> (d. 428) who lived when Mithraism was almost a thing of the past &#151; these are our only sources, unless we include the <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a> in which Mithra is indeed mentioned, but which cannot be an authority for Roman Mithraism with which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is compared. Our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is mostly ingenious guess-work; of the real inner working of Mithraism and the sense in which it was understood by those who professed it at the advent of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing.

<p>(2) Some apparent similarities exist; but in a number of details it is quite probable that Mithraism was the borrower from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> about 200 could say: "hesterni sumus et omnia vestra implevimus" ("we are but of yesterday, yet your whole world is full of us"). It is not unnatural to suppose that a religion which filled the whole world, should have been copied at least in some details by another religion which was quite popular during the third century. Moreover the resemblances pointed out are superficial and external. Similarity in words and names is nothing; it is the sense that matters. During these centuries <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was coining its own technical terms, and naturally took names, terms, and expressions current in that day; and so did Mithraism. But under identical terms each system thought its own thoughts. Mithra is called a mediator; and so is Christ; but Mithra originally only in a <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogonic</a> or <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> sense; Christ, being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man, is by nature the Mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man. And so in similar instances. Mithraism had a <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a sacred banquet is as old as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> and existed at all ages and amongst all peoples. Mithra saved the world by sacrificing a bull; Christ by sacrificing Himself. It is hardly possible to conceive a more radical difference than that between Mithra taurochtonos and Christ crucified. Christ was born of a Virgin; there is nothing to prove that the same was believed of Mithra born from the rock. Christ was born in a cave; and Mithraists worshipped in a cave, but Mithra was born under a tree near a river. Much as been made of the presence of adoring shepherds; but their existence on <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> has not been proven, and considering that man had not yet appeared, it is an anachronism to suppose their presence.

<p>(3) Christ was an historical personage, recently born in a well-known town of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and crucified under a Roman governor, whose name figured in the ordinary official lists. Mithra was an abstraction, a personification not even of the sun but of the diffused daylight; his incarnation, if such it may be called, was supposed to have happened before the creation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, before all history. The small Mithraic congregations were like <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">masonic</a> lodges for a few and for men only and even those mostly of one class, the military; a religion that excludes the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">half of the human race</a> bears no comparison to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">religion of Christ</a>. Mithraism was all comprehensive and tolerant of every other cult, the Pater Patrum himself was an adept in a number of other <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>; <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was essential exclusive, condemning every other religion in the world, alone and unique in its majesty.
