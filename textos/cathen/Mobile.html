<h1>Mobile</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF MOBILE (<a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French</a> MOBILE, Spanish MAUBILA, Latin MOBILIENSIS).

<p>Suffragan of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, comprises the <a href="../cathen/01240a.htm">State of Alabama</a> (51,540 sq. miles) and western Florida (7281 square miles), and derives its name from Mauvila, the fort and chief city of the Gulf Indians, who with their "emperor", Tuscaloosa, "black warrior", were conquered by the Spanish soldier and explorer, Hernando <a href="../cathen/14152a.htm">de Soto</a>, in 1540.
<h2>Early history</h2>

<p>De Soto's expedition was accompanied by "twelve <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, eight <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and four religious". Mass was certainly offered near the present city of Mobile as early as 1540. From 1540 to 1703 <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries went from post to post along the Mississippi Valley, ministering to the wants of the scattered Spanish, French, and English settlers and to the native Indian converts. The published records of their heroism, sealed at times with the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs'</a> blood, are very meagre, their names even, in great part, being lost in the obscurity of that long and troublous period. Not until the beginning of the eighteenth century, have we anything like a historical account of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. "Fort St. Louis de la Mobile" was founded by Iberville, the illustrious <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French-Canadian</a> explorer (1702), at some distance from the present city of Mobile, the site of which was selected (1710) by Iberville's brother, Bienville. Mobile was formally erected into a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> (20 July, 1703), subject to the Seminary of Foreign Missions in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Quebec.

<p>The Rev. Henry Roulleaux de la Vente was the first <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (July, 1704), his <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a>, the Rev. Alexander Huv&eacute;. The first entry found in the records of the new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> is that of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of an Apalache girl (6 September, 1703), by the Rev. A. Davion. The Rev. J. B. de St. Cosme was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by savages on his way to Mobile from <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">Natchez</a> late in 1706. The last record of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> (13 January, 1721), that of the Rev. Alexander Huv&eacute;, appears in the ancient register of Mobile. The work was resumed by the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. The Quebec Act of 1774 conferred on the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Mobile among others, legal title to his <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>. With the surrender of Mobile to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (12 March, 1780), the records are kept in <a href="../cathen/14192a.htm">Spanish</a> and the church in Mobile is definitely known as the church of the Immaculate Conception. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> erected the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of St. Louis of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> (25 April, 1793), usually styled Louisiana and the Floridas. The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, therefore, of the ordinaries of Quebec and Santiago de Cuba over that immense territory ceased with the selection of its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the Right Rev. Luis Pe&ntilde;alver y Cardenas, who arrived in <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> 17 July, 1795. From 1792 to 1800 the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Mobile was the Rev. Constantine McKenna, and its last incumbent under Spanish rule, the Rev. Vincent Genin.
<h2>Bishops</h2>

<p>(1) MICHAEL PORTIER, b. at Montbrison, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 1795: d. at Mobile, 4 May, 1859. He came to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> 4 September, 1817. Completing his studies at St. Mary's Seminary, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, Md., he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Bishop Dubourg at St. Louis (1818), and eight years later, in the same city was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Oleno by Bishop Rosati, and became first <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of the new Vicariate of Alabama and the Floridas. At the time of his accession he was the only <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> in the vicariate and had practically only three congregations with churches, Mobile, Ala., and the old Spanish cities of St. Augustine, Fla. (founded 1565), and Pensacola, Fla. (founded 1696). The first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who came to his assistance was the Rev. Edward T. Mayne, a student of Mt. St. Mary's College, Emmitsburg, Md., sent by <a href="../cathen/05470a.htm">Bishop England</a> of <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>, to take charge of the deserted <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Augustine. Bishop Portier began his administration by riding through his vicariate and visited Pensacola, Tallahassee, and St. Augustine, offering the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>, preaching, and administering the Sacraments as he went. He sailed for <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> (1829) in quest of assistants, and returning with two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and four <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, found the vicariate raised to the Diocese of Mobile. His <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was a little church twenty feet wide by fifty feet deep, his residence a still smaller two-roomed frame structure. By 1850 there were churches and congregations in Mobile, Spring Hill, Summerville, Mount Vernon, Fish River, Pensacola, Tuscaloosa, and Montgomery. He was somewhat relieved in the same year by the detachment of the eastern portion of <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a> and its annexation to the newly-created <a href="../cathen/13488a.htm">See of Savannah</a>, Ga. To add to his relief the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the Immaculate Conception, built mainly through the untiring efforts of the Rev. J McGarahan, was finished at a cost of over eighty thousand dollars, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 8 December, 1850. About 1830 Bishop Portier established Spring Hill College and Seminary, at the head of which was the Rev. Mathias Loras until he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a> (10 December, 1837) by Bishop Portier, who also <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> another president of Spring Hill, the Rev. John S. Basin, third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Vincennes, 24 October, 1847. Spring Hill College, for a time in charge of the <a href="../cathen/05596b.htm">Eudist</a> Fathers, was taken over by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> (1846) and has since been managed successfully by them. Bishop Portier held there a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod (19 January, 1835). In 1833 he secured from the Visitation <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, Georgetown, a colony of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> who established in Mobile a house and academy, which is in a very flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. He brought the <a href="../cathen/13305a.htm">Brothers of the Sacred Heart</a> from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (about 1847), and the Sisters of Charity from Emmitsburg, Md., to manage <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> for boys and girls respectively. One of his last acts was the foundation of an infirmary at Mobile conducted by the Sisters of Charity.



<p>(2) JOHN QUINLAN second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mobile, b. in County Cork, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 19 October, 1826; d. at Mobile, 9 March 1883. He came to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, 1844, studied' for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in Mt. St. Mary's College, Emmitsburg, Md., and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Archbishop Purcell</a> (1853), with a fellow student, Richard Gilmour, afterwards second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mobile, 4 Dec., 1859, by Archbishop Blanc in St. Louis' <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, La. In his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> he found twelve churches and fourteen <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for which he had only eight <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and he therefore brought from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> eleven young candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Two of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who came to Bishop Quinlan at this time are <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> workers in the diocese today, the Very Rev. C. T. O'Callaghan, D.D., V.G., <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Vincent's church, Mobile, several times administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and the Very Rev. D. Savage, D.D., <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Peter's church, Montgomery, a member of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> council. Bishop Quinlan's administration fell upon the storm days of internecine strife. After the battle of Shiloh, he hastened on a special train to the blood-stained battle-ground and ministered to the temporal and spiritual wants of North and South. After the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> activities were crippled. Nevertheless, besides repairing ruined churches, Bishop Quinlan built the portico of the Mobile <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, founded St. Patrick's and St. Mary's churches in the same city, and established churches in Huntsville, Decatur, Tuscumbia, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, Cullman, <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, Eufaula, Whistler, and Toulminville. April, 1876, Bishop Quinlan invited the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> from St. Vincent's Abbey, Pa., to the diocese, and they settled at Cullman. The first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the new settlement was the Rt. Rev. Benedict Menges, O.S.B., succeeded (1905) by Rt. Rev, Bernard Menges, O.S.B., under whose capable management the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and college are progressing and extending their influence considerably.

<p>(3) DOMINIC MANUCY, third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mobile, b. in St. Augustine, Fla., 20 December, 1823; d. at Mobile, 4 December, 1885. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Spring Hill College, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> (1850) by Bishop Portier, and for twenty-four years laboured in Montgomery and Mobile. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at Mobile (8 Dec., 1874), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dulma, and appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of Brownsville, Tex., and was transferred to the Diocese of Mobile (9 March, 1884), without being relieved, however, from his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, but finding the burden too great he resigned and was appointed to the <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> of Maronea.

<p>(4) JEREMIAH O'SULLIVAN, fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mobile, b. in County Cork, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1844; d. at Mobile, 10 August, 1896. He came to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, 1863, entered St. Charles College, Ellicott City, Md., whence he proceeded to St. Mary's Seminary, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, Md., was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (June, 1868) by Archbishop Spalding, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mobile (20 Sept., 1885), by <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, then <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, Gibbons. The present towers of the Mobile <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> were built by Bishop O'Sullivan, who successfully strove to restore the mined financial status of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. A gifted administrator, an admired orator, an extremely <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Bishop O'Sullivan travelled and laboured unceasingly in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and left to posterity a monument of noble results, temporal and spiritual, quietly and unostentatiously achieved.

<p>(5) EDWARD PATRICK ALLEN, fifth and present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mobile, was born in Lowell, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, 17 March, 1853, and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Mt. St. Mary's College, Emmitsburg, Md., where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by <a href="../cathen/02382a.htm">Bishop Becker</a>, 17 Dec., 1881. He was appointed president of Mt. St. Mary's (1884), and filled that office most acceptably until his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mobile, by Cardinal Gibbons, in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, Md. (16 May, 1897). Under the able and prudent management of Bishop Allen, the diocese has advanced with great strides, and is still developing at a rapid growth. Many churches and missions have been erected, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> established, the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> more than doubled, and considerable <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> acquired with a view to the further development of his rapidly increasing charge. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was sorely tried by a fearful storm and tidal wave (Sept., 1906). Many churches either totally or partially destroyed have been rebuilt or repaired. But the complete results of Bishop Allen's pro sperous administration are best noticed by a comparison between the standing of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> when he assumed control and its existing admirable state.
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>1897 (year of Bishop Allen's arrival).--Churches with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 22; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 15; children under <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> care in colleges, academies; and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 2526; <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 2; <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 2; <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, infants, 820, converts, 60; <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, 163; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, 17,000; <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, secular and religious, 48.

<p>Bishop Allen takes a lively interest in the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">Negro</a> Missions, and is largely responsible for the good work being done by the Josephite Fathers in Mobile and vicinity, <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, and Montgomery. Near the latter city is St. Joseph's College, founded (1901) by the Very Rev. T. B.  Donovan, lately deceased, the primary object of which "is to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educate</a> young colored men to be catechists and teachers." With Bishop Allen's sanction a colored fraternal organization was instituted in Mobile, 1909, by the Rev. C Rebescher, which gives promise of universal good.
<h3>Benefactors</h3>

<p>The chief benefactors of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> were Messrs. Felix and Arthur McGill &#151; the McGill Institute, a high school for boys, bears their name. The Hannan Home for the aged poor is a tribute to the generosity of Major P. C. Hannan, who built it along the lines of Bishop Allen's choosing.
<h3>Religious orders</h3>

<p>In the Diocese of Mobile are the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, Josephite Fathers, and <a href="../cathen/13305a.htm">Brothers of the Sacred Heart</a>. Also the Sisters of the Visitation, Sisters of Charity, <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, Sisters of Loretto, <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, Sisters of St. Benedict, <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, and Sisters of Perpetual Adoration. There are three <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cemeteries, one in Mobile, one in <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, and one in Montgomery. The intrepid <a href="../cathen/13712b.htm">Admiral Semmes</a> and Father Ryan, the poet-priest, are buried in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Cemetery, Mobile. By a singular coincidence the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who came to labour in the new Diocese of Mobile and the last and ruling <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mobile were students of Mt.
