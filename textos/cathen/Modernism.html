<h2 id="i">Origin of the word</h2>

<p>Etymologically, <em>modernism</em> means an exaggerated <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of what is modern, an infatuation for modern <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, "the abuse of what is modern", as the Abb&eacute; Gaudaud explains (La Foi catholique, I, 1908, p. 248). The modern <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of which we speak are not as old as the period called "modern times". Though <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> has generated them little by little, it did not understand from the beginning that such would be its sequel. There even exists a conservative <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> party which is one with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in combating modernism. In general we may say that modernism aims at that radical transformation of human thought in relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, man, the world, and life, here and hereafter, which was prepared by <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> and eighteenth-century philosophy, and solemnly <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. J.J. Rousseau, who treated an <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheistical</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> of his time as a modernist, seems to have been the first to use the word in this sense ("Correspondance &agrave; M. D.", 15 Jan. 1769). <a href="../cathen/09295b.htm">Littr&eacute;</a> (Dictionnaire), who cites the passage; explains: "Modernist, one who esteems modern times above antiquity". After that, the word seems to have been forgotten, till the time of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> publicist P&eacute;rin (1815-1905), professor at the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, 1844-1889. This writer, while apologizing for the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a>, describes "the humanitarian tendencies of contemporary <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>" as modernism. The term itself he defines as "the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> to eliminate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from all social life". With this absolute modernism he associates a more temperate form, which he declares to be nothing less than "liberalism of every degree and shade" ("Le Modernisme dans l'&Eacute;glise d'apr&egrave;s les lettres in&eacute;ditesde Lamennais", Paris, 1881).

<p>During the early years of the present century, especially about 1905 and 1906, the tendency to innovation which troubled the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and especially the ranks of the young <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, was taxed with modernism. Thus at <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, 1905, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the ecclesiastical provinces of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> and <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>, in a circular letter of that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, uttered grave warnings against what they called "Modernismo nel clero" (Modernism among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>). Several pastoral letters of the year 1906 made use of the same term; among others we may mention the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> charge of Cardinal Nava, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03429a.htm">Catania</a>, to his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, a letter of Cardinal Bacilieri, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 22 July, 1906 and a letter of Mgr Rossi, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01101a.htm">Acerenza</a> and Matera. "Modernismo e Modernisti", a work by Abbate Cavallanti which was published towards the end of 1906, gives long extracts from these letters. The name "modernism" was not to the liking of the reformers. The propriety of the new term was discussed even amongst good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Lamentabili" appeared, Mgr Baudrillart expressed his pleasure at not finding the word "modernism" mentioned in it (Revue pratique d'apologetique, IV, p. 578). He considered the term "too vague". Besides it seemed to insinuate "that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> condemns everything modern". The <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi" (8 Sept., 1907) put an end to the discussion. It bore the official title, "De Modernistarum doctrinis". The introduction declared that the name commonly given to the upholders of the new <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> was not inapt. Since then the modernists themselves have acquiesced in the use of the name, though they have not admitted its propriety (Loisy, "Simples r&eacute;flexions sur le decret 'Lamentabili' et sur l'encyclique 'Pascendi' du 8 Sept., 1907", p. 14; "Il programma dei modernisti": note at the beginning).

<h2 id="ii">Theory of theological Modernism</h2>

<h3 id="III">The essential error of Modernism</h3>

<p>A full definition of modernism would be rather difficult. First it stands for certain tendencies, and secondly for a body of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which, if it has not given birth to these tendencies (practice often precedes theory), serves at any rate as their explanation and support. Such tendencies manifest themselves in different domains. They are not united in each individual, nor are they always and everywhere found together. Modernist <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, too, may be more or less radical, and it is swallowed in doses that vary with each one's likes and dislikes. In the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi", <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> says that modernism embraces every <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. M. Loisy makes practically the same statement when he writes that "in reality all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, even in its fundamental principles the general philosophy of religion, <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> that govern our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, come up for judgment before this new court of assize" (Simples r&eacute;flexions, p. 24). Modernism is a composite system: its assertions and claims lack that principle which unites the natural faculties in a living being. The <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi" was the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> synthesis of the subject. Out of scattered materials it built up what looked like a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> system. Indeed friends and foes alike could not but admire the patient skill that must have been needed to fashion something like a coordinated whole. In their answer to the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a>, "Il programma dei Modernisti", the Modernists tried to retouch this synthesis. Previous to all this, some of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, in their pastoral letters, had attempted such a synthesis. We would particularly mention that of Mgr Rossi, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01101a.htm">Acerenza</a> and Matera. In this respect, too, Abbate Cavallanti's book, already referred to, deserves mention. Even earlier still, German and <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">French Protestants</a> had done some synthetical work in the same direction. Prominent among them are <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, "Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der reinen Vernunft" (1803); Schleiermacher, "Der christliche Glaube" (1821-1822); and A. Sabatier, "Esquisse d'une philosophie de la religion d'apr&egrave; la psychologie et l'histoire" (1897).



<p>The general <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of modernism may be best expressed in the words of Abbate Cavallanti, though even here there is a little vagueness: "Modernism is modern in a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> sense of the word; it is a morbid state of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and especially young <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, that professes manifold ideals, opinions, and tendencies. From time to time these tendencies work out into systems, that are to renew the basis and superstructure of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, politics, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself and of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>". A remodelling, a renewal according to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the twentieth century &#151; such is the longing that possesses the modernists. "The avowed modernists", says M. Loisy, "form a fairly definite group of thinking men united in the common desire to adapt <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, moral and social needs of today" (op. cit., p. 13). "Our religious attitude", as "Il programma dei modernisti" states (p. 5, note l), "is ruled by the single wish to be one with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who live in harmony with the spirit of the age". The spirit of this plan of reform may be summarized under the following heads: <ul><li>A spirit of complete emancipation, tending to weaken <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority; the emancipation of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, which must traverse every field of investigation without fear of conflict with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the emancipation of the State, which should never be hampered by religious authority; the emancipation of the private <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> whose inspirations must not be overridden by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> definitions or <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a>; the emancipation of the universal <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, with which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be ever in agreement; <li>A spirit of movement and change, with an inclination to a sweeping form of evolution such as abhors anything fixed and stationary; <li>A spirit of reconciliation among all men through the feelings of the heart. Many and varied also are the modernist dreams of an understanding between the different <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religions</a>, nay, even between religion and a species of <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a>, and all on a basis of agreement that must be superior to mere <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> differences. </ul>

<p>Such are the fundamental tendencies. As such, they seek to explain, justify, and strengthen themselves in an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, to which therefore one might give the name of "essential" modernism. What is this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>? It is nothing less than the perversion of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. Manifold are the degrees and shades of modernist <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on the question of our relations with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But no real modernist keeps the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> notions of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> intact. Are you <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> as to whether a writer or a book is modernist in the formal sense of the word? Verify every statement about <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>; examine his treatment of its origin, its nature, its sense, its authority. You will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether you are dealing with a veritable modernist or not, according to the way in which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> conception of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> is travestied or respected. Dogma and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are correlative terms; one implies the other as the action implies its object. In this way then we may define modernism as "the critique of our <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> postulates of contemporary philosophy".

<p>It will be advisable for us to quote a full critique of such <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as an example of the mode of procedure. (In the meantime however we must not forget that there are partial and less advanced modernists who do not go so far). For them external <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> furnishes man with but phenomenal contingent, sensible <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. He sees, he feels, he hears, he tastes, he touches this something, this phenomenon that comes and goes without telling him aught of the existence of a suprasensible, absolute and unchanging reality outside all environing space and time. But deep within himself man feels the need of a higher hope. He aspires to perfection in a being on whom he feels his destiny depends. And so he has an instinctive, an affective yearning for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> impulse is at first obscure and hidden in the subconsciousness. Once consciously understood, it reveals to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the intimate presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This manifestation, in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man collaborate, is nothing else than revelation. Under the influence of its yearning, that is of its religious feelings, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> tries to reach <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to adopt towards Him an attitude that will satisfy its yearning. It gropes, it searches. These gropings form the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> religious experience. They are more easy, successful and far-reaching, or less so, according as it is now one, now another individual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that sets out in quest of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Anon there are privileged ones who reach extraordinary results. They communicate their discoveries to their fellow men, and forthwith become founders of a new religion, which is more or less <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the proportion in which it gives peace to the religious feelings.

<p>The attitude Christ adopted, reaching up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as to a father and then returning to men as to brothers &#151; such is the meaning of the precept, "Love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and thy neighbour" &#151; brings full rest to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. It makes the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">religion of Christ</a> the religion <em>par excellence</em>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and definitive religion. The act by which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> adopts this attitude and abandons itself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as a father and then to men as to brothers, constitutes the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>. Plainly such an act is an act of the will rather than of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But religious sentiment tries to express itself in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> concepts, which in their turn serve to preserve this sentiment. Hence the origin of those formulae concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Divine things, of those theoretical propositions that are the outcome of the successive religious experiences of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> gifted with the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. These formulae become <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, when religious authority approves of them for the life of the community. For community life is a spontaneous growth among <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and with it comes authority. Dogmas <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in this way teach us nothing of the unknowable, but only symbolize it. They contain no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Their usefulness in preserving the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is their only <em>raison d'&ecirc;tre</em>. They survive as long as they exert their influence. Being the work of man in time, and adapted to his varying needs, they are at best but contingent and transient. Religious authority too, naturally conservative, may lag behind the times. It may mistake the best methods of meeting needs of the community, and try to keep up worn-out formulae. Through respect for the community, the individual <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> who sees the mistake continues in an attitude of outward submission. But he does not feel himself inwardly bound by the decisions of higher powers; rather he makes praiseworthy efforts to bring his Church into harmony with the times. He may confine himself, too, if he cares, to the older and simpler religious forms; he may live his life in conformity with the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> accepted from the beginning. Such is Tyrrell's advice in his letter to Fogazzaro, and such was his own private practice.

<h3 id="IV">Catholic and Modernist notions of dogma compared</h3>

<p>The tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, on the other hand, considers <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> as in part <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> and mysterious, proposed to our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by a Divinely instituted authority on the ground that they are part of the general revelation which the Apostles preached in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. This <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is an act of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> made under the sway of the will. By it we hold firmly what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has revealed and what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> proposes to us to believe. For <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> is holding something firmly on the authority of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> word, when such authority may be recognized by signs that are sufficient, at least with the help of grace, to create certitude.

<p>Comparing these notions, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and the modernist, we shall see that modernism alters the source, the manner of <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a>, the object, the stability, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. For the modernist, the only and the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> source is the private consciousness. And <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> so, since he rejects <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and prophecy as signs of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> word (Il programma, p. 96). For the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> is a free communication of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the believer made through the preaching of the Word. Of course the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from without, which is above and beyond any natural want, is preceded by a certain interior finality or perfectibility which enables the believer to assimilate and live the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> revealed. It enters a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> well-disposed to receive it, as a principle of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> which, though an unmerited gift to which we have no right, is still such as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can enjoy with unmeasured gratitude. In the modernist conception, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can no longer define <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> name and with His infallible help; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority is now but a secondary interpreter, subject to the collective consciousness which she has to express. To this collective consciousness the individual need conform only externally; as for the rest he may embark on any private religious adventures he cares for. The modernist proportions <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> to his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> or rather to his heart. Mysteries like the Trinity or the Incarnation are either unthinkable (a modernist <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantian</a> tendency), or are within the reach of the unaided reason (a modernist <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegelian</a> tendency). "The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of religion is in him (man) implicitly, as surely as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the whole physical <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, is involved in every part of it. Could he read the needs of his own spirit and <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, he would need no teacher" (Tyrrell, "Scylla and Charybdis", p. 277).

<p>Assuredly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not a lifeless thing. Rather is it a living tree that breaks forth into green leaves, flowers, and fruits. There is a development, or gradual unfolding, and a clearer statement of its <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>. Besides the primary <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, such as the Divinity of Christ and His mission as <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, there are others which, one by one, become better understood and defined, e.g. the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Immaculate Conception and that of the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">Infallibility of the Pope</a>. Such unfolding takes place not only in the study of the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> but also in showing its origin in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> and the Apostles, in the understanding of the terms expressing it and in the historical or rational <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> adduced in support of it. Thus the historical <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Immaculate Conception has certainly been strengthened since the definition in 1854. The rational conception of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> is a continual object of study; the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a> allows the reason to inquire into the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of sacrifice. It has always been believed that there is no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but as this <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> has gradually come to be better understood, many are now considered within the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who would have been placed without, in a day when the distinction between the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had not generally obtained. In another sense, too <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> is <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> with life. For its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not sterile, but always serves to nourish devotion. But while holding with life, progress and development, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> rejects transitory <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> that in the modernist theory would be forgotten unless replaced by contrary formulae. She cannot admit that "thought, hierarchy, cult, in a word, everything has changed in the history of Christianity", nor can she be content with "the identity of religious spirit" which is the only permanency that modernism admits (Il programma dei Modernisti).

<p>Truth consists in the conformity of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> with its object. Now, in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> concept, a dogmatic formula supplies us with at least an analogical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a given object. For the modernist, the essential nature of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> consists in its correspondence with and its capacity to satisfy a certain momentary need of the religious feeling. It is an arbitrary symbol that tells nothing of the object it represents. At most, as M. Leroy, one of the least radical of modernists, suggests, it is a positive prescription of a practical order (Leroy, "Dogme et critique", p. 25). Thus the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence in the Holy Eucharist</a> means: "Act as if Christ had the local presence, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of which is so familiar to you". But, to avoid exaggeration, we add this other statement of the same writer (loc. cit.), "This however does not mean that <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> bears no relation to thought; for (1) there are <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> concerning the action of thinking; (2) <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> itself implicitly affirms that reality contains in one form or another the justification of such prescriptions as are either reasonable or salutary".

<h2 id="v">Various degrees of Modernism and its criterion</h2>

<p>Modernist attacks on <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, as we have already remarked, vary according to the degree in which its doctrines are embraced. Thus, in virtue of the leading <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of their systems, Father Tyrrell was an <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">agnostic</a> modernist, and Campbell (a Congregationalist minister) is a symbolic modernist. Again the tendency to innovation is at times not at all general, but limited to some particular domain. Along with modernism in the strict sense, which is directly <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, we find other kinds of modernism in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, politics, and social <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. In such cases a wider meaning must be given to the term.

<p>Here, however, it is needful to speak a word of warning against unreasonable attacks. Not every novelty is to be condemned, nor is every project of reform to be dubbed modernist because it is untimely or exaggerated. In the same way, the attempt fully to understand modern philosophic thought so as to grasp what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in such systems, and to discover the points of contact with the old philosophy, is very far from being modernism. On the contrary, that is the very best way to refute modernism. Every <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> contains an element of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Isolate that element and accept it. The structure which it helps to support, having lost its foundation, will soon crumble. The name modernist then will be appropriate only when there is question of opposition to the certain teaching of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority through a spirit of innovation. The words of Cardinal Ferrari. <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, as cited in "La Revue Pratique d'Apolog&eacute;tique" (VI, 1908, p. 134), will help to show the point of our last remark. "We are deeply pained", he says, "to find that certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, in public controversy against modernism, in brochures, newspapers and other periodicals, go to the length of detecting the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> everywhere, or at any rate of imputing it to those who are very far from being infected with it". In the same year, Cardinal Maffei had to condemn "La Penta azurea", an anti-modernist organ, on account of its exaggeration in this respect. On the other hand, it is regrettable that certain avowed leaders of modernism, carried away perhaps by the desire to remain within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at all costs &#151; another characteristic of modernism &#151; have taken refuge in equivocation, reticence, or quibbles. Such a line of action merits no sympathy; while it explains, if it does not altogether justify, the distrust of sincere <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.

<h2 id="vi">Proofs of the foregoing views</h2>

<p>But does the principle and the quasi-essential <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of modernism lie in its corruption of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>? Let us consult the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi". The official Latin text calls the modernist dogmatic system a leading chapter in their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. The French translation, which is also authentic, speaks thus: "Dogma, its origin and nature, such is the ground principle of modernism." The fundamental principle of modernism is, according to M. Loisy, "the possibility, the necessity and the legitimacy of evolution in understanding the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, including that of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> and authority, as well as in the manner of exercising this authority" (op. cit., p. 124). The character and leaning of our epoch confirm our diagnosis. It likes to substitute leading and fundamental questions in the place of side issues. The problem of natural <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the burning question in present-day <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>. It is not surprising therefore that the question of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the main subject of discussion in religious polemics. Finally, <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> has said that modernism embraces all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. (The same opinion is expressed in another way in the encyclical "Editae" of 16 May, 1910.) And what <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, we ask, more fully justifies the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> statement than that which alters <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> in its root and essence? It is furthermore clear &#151; to use a direct argument &#151; that modernism fails in its attempt at religious reform, if it makes no change in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> notion of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. Moreover, does not its own conception of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> explain both a large number of its propositions and its leanings towards independence, evolution, and conciliation?

<h2 id="vii">Modernist aims explained by its essential error</h2>

<p>The definition of an unchangeable <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> imposes itself on every <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, learned or otherwise, and it necessarily supposes a Church legislating for all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, passing judgment on State action &#151; from its own point of view of course &#151; and that even seeks alliance with the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> to carry on the work of the Apostolate. On the other hand, once <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> is held to be a mere symbol of the unknowable, a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> which merely deals with the facts of nature or history could neither oppose it nor even enter into controversy with it. If it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> only in so far as it excites and nourishes religious sentiment, the private individual is at full liberty to throw it aside when its influence on him has ceased; nay, even the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself, whose existence depends on a <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> not different from the others in nature and origin, has no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to legislate for a self-sufficing State. And thus independence is fully realized. There is no need to prove that the modernist spirit of movement and evolution is in perfect harmony with its concept of ever-changing <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and is unintelligible without it; the matter is self-evident. Finally, as regards the conciliation of the different <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, we must necessarily distinguish between what is essential to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> regarded as a sentiment, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> which are accessory, mutable, and practically negligible. If therefore you go as far as making the Divinity a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, that is to say, a symbolical expression of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, then docility in following generous impulses may be religious, and the <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheist's</a> religion would not seem to differ essentially from yours.

<h2 id="xvii">Modernist propositions explained by its essential error</h2>

<p>We make a selection of the following propositions from the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> for discussion: <ul><li>the Christ of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not the Christ of history. Faith portrays Christ according to the religious needs of the faithful; history represents Him as He really was, that is, in so far as His appearance on earth was a concrete phenomenon. In this way it is easy to understand how a believer may, without contradiction, attribute certain things to Christ, and at the same time deny them in the quality of historian. In the "Hibbert Journal" for Jan., 1909, the Rev. Mr. Robert wished to call the Christ of history "Jesus" and reserve "Christ" for the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> as idealized by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; <li><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> work in founding the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and instituting the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> was mediate, not immediate. The main point is to find supports for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now, as religious experience succeeds so well in creating useful <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, why may it not do likewise in the matter of institutions suited to the age? <li>The <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> act as eloquent formulae which touch the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and carry it away. Precisely; for if <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> exist only in so far as they preserve religious sentiment, what other service can one expect of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>? <li>The Sacred Books are in every religion a collection of religious experiences of an extraordinary nature. For if there is no external revelation, the only substitute possible is the subjective religious experience of men of particular gifts, experiences such as are worthy of being preserved for the community.</ul>

<h2 id="viii">The Modernist movement</h2>

<p>The late M. P&eacute;rin dated the modernist movement from the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. And rightly so, for it was then that many of those modern liberties which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has reproved as unrestrained and ungoverned, first found sanction. Several of the propositions collected in the Syllabus of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, although enunciated from a <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalist</a> point of view, have been appropriated by modernism. Such, for example are, the fourth proposition which derives all religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from the natural force of reason; the fifth, which affirms that revelation, if it joins in the onward march of reason, is capable of unlimited progress; the seventh, which treats the prophecies and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> as poetical imaginings; propositions sixteen to eighteen on the equal value of all <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> from the point of view of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; proposition fifty-five on the separation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>; propositions seventy-five and seventy-six, which oppose the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The modernist tendency is still more apparent in the last proposition, which was condemned on 18 March, 1861: "The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> can and ought to conform with contemporary progress, <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">liberalism</a>, and civilization."

<p>Taking only the great lines of the modernist movement within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself. we may say that under <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> its tendency was politico-liberal, under <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> social; later, under <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, its tendency became avowedly <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>.

<p>It is in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> above all that modernism properly so-called, that is, the form which attacks the very concept of religion and <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, has spread its ravages among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Indeed, some time after the publication of the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> of 8th September, 1907 the German, English, and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> congratulated themselves that their respective countries had been spared the epidemic in its more contagious form. Of course, individual upholders of the new <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> are to be found everywhere, and even <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> has produced modernists of note. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, on the contrary, even before the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> appeared, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have raised the cry of alarm in their pastoral letters of 1906 and 1907. Newspapers and reviews, openly modernist in their opinions, bear witness to the gravity of the danger which the Sovereign Pontiff sought to avert. After <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> it is <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> that has furnished the largest number of adherents to this religious reform or ultra-progressive party. In spite of the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notoriety</a> of certain <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, comparatively few <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> have joined the movement; so far it has found adherents chiefly among the ranks of the younger <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> possesses a modernist publishing house (La librairie Nourry). A modernist review founded by the late Father Tyrrell, "Nova et Vetera", is published at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. "La Revue Moderniste Internationale" was started this year (1910) at <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>. This monthly periodical calls itself "the organ of the international modernist <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>". It is open to every shade of modernist opinions, and claims to have co-workers and correspondents in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a> and America. The <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi" notes and deplores the ardour of the modernist propaganda. A strong current of modernism is running through the Russian Schismatic Church. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> has not escaped. And indeed liberal <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> is nothing but a radical form of modernism that is winning the greater number of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the Reformed Church. Others who oppose the innovation find refuge in the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<h2 id="ix">The philosophical origin and consequences of Modernism</h2>

<h3 id="X">The origin</h3>

<p>Philosophy renders great service to the cause of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> calls for its assistance too. Many consider the philosophic groundwork of modernism to be <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantian</a>. This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, if by <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantian</a> philosophy is meant every system that has a root connection with the philosophy of the Koenigsberg sage. In other words, the basis of modernist philosophy is <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantian</a> if, because <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> is its father and most illustrious moderate representative, all <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">agnosticism</a> be called <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantism</a> (by <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">agnosticism</a> is meant the philosophy which denies that reason, used at any rate in a speculative and theoretical way, can gain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of suprasensible things). It is not our business here to oppose the application of the name <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantian</a> to modernist philosophy. Indeed if we compare the two systems, we shall find that they have two elements in common, the negative part of the "Critique of Pure Reason" (which reduces pure or speculative <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to phenomenal or experiential <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a>), and a certain argumentative method in distinguishing <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> from the real basis of religion. On the positive side, however, modernism differs from <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantism</a> in some essential points. For <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is a really rational adhesion of the mind to the postulates of practical reason. The will is free to accept or reject the moral law; and it is on account of this option that he calls its acceptance "belief". Once it is accepted, the reason cannot but admit the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, liberty, and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. Modernist <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, on the other hand, is a matter of sentiment, a flinging of oneself towards the Unknowable, and cannot be scientifically justified by reason. In <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant's</a> system, <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> and the whole positive framework of religion are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> only for the childhood of humanity or for the common people. They are symbols that bear a certain analogy to images and comparisons. They serve to inculcate those moral <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> that for <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> constitute religion. Modernist symbols, though changeable and fleeting, correspond to a law of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Generally speaking, they help to excite and nourish the effective religious sentiment which <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> (who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it from his reading of the pietists) calls <em>schw&auml;rmerei</em>. <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalist</a>, rejects <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> religion and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The modernists consider natural religion a useless abstraction; for them it is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> rather that constitutes the very essence of religion. It would be more correct to say that modernism is an offshoot of Schleiermacher (1768-1834), who though he owed something to <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant's</a> philosophy, nevertheless built up his own <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> system. <a href="../cathen/13086a.htm">Ritschl</a> called him the "legislator of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>" (Rechtf. und Vers., III, p. 486). Schleiermacher conceives the modernist plan of reforming religion with the view of conciliating it with <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. Thus would he establish an <em>entente cordiale</em> among the various cults, and even between religion and a kind of religious sentimentality which, without recognizing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet tends towards the Good and the Infinite. Like the modernists, he has dreams of new religious <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a>; he wants to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; he declares himself independent of all philosophy; he rejects natural religion as a pure abstraction, and derives <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> from religious experience. His principal writings on this subject are "Ueber die Religion" (1799: note the difference between the first and the later editions) and "Der Christliche Glaube" (1821-22). <a href="../cathen/13086a.htm">Ritschl</a>, one of <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant's</a> disciples, recognizes the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> as the historical basis of religion. He sees in Christ the consciousness of an intimate union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and considers the institution of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, which for him is inconceivable without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as a special act of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">God's providence</a>. Thus has he prepared the way for a form of modernism more temperate than that of Schleiermacher. Though he predicted a continual development of religion, Schleiermacher admitted a certain fixity of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. For this reason it seems to us that modernists owe their radical evolutionary theory to Herbert Spencer (1820-1903). It was through the writings of A. Sabatier (18391901), a <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">French Protestant</a> of the Broad Church type) that the religious theories we have spoken of, spread among the Latin races, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. It is in these countries, too, that modernism has done greatest harm among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Sabatier is a radical modernist. He has especially drawn upon Schleiermacher for the composition of his two works on religious synthesis ("Esquisse d'une philosophie de la religion d'apr&egrave; la psychologie et l'histoire", Paris, 1897; Les religions d'autorit&eacute; et la religion de l'esprit", Paris, 1902).

<p>The fundamental <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the modernist philosophy is its misunderstanding of the scholastic formula which takes account of the two aspects of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Doubtless, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is a vital faculty endowed with an activity of its own, and tending towards its own object. However, as it is not in continual activity, it is not self-sufficient; it has not in itself the full principle of its operations, but is forced to utilize sensible experience in order to arrive at <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. This incompleteness and falling short of perfect autonomy is due to man's very nature. As a consequence, in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and activity, account must be taken both of the intrinsic and of the extrinsic side. Urged on by the finality that inspires him man tends towards those objects which suit him, while at the same time objects offer themselves to him. In the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> life, man acquires new principles of action and, as it were, a new nature. He is now capable of acts of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the formal object. These acts, however, most be proposed to man, whether <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> deigns to do so by direct revelation to man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or whether, in conformity with man's social nature, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> makes use of intermediaries who communicate exteriorly with man. Hence the necessity of preaching, of motives of credibility, and of external teaching authority. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> philosophy does not deny the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> spontaneous life, the sublimity of its suprasensible and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> operations, and the inadequacy of words to translate its yearnings. <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> give expression to mystical transports far superior to those of the modernists. But in their philosophy they never forget the lowliness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which is not purely spiritual. The modernist remembers only the internal element of our higher activity. This absolute and exclusive intrinsecism constitutes what the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> calls "vital immanence". When deprived of the external support which is indispensable to them, the acts of the higher <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> faculties can only consist in vague sentiments which are as indetermined as are those faculties themselves. Hence it is that modernist doctrines, necessarily expressed in terms of this sentiment, are so intangible. Furthermore, by admitting the necessity of symbols, modernism makes to extrinsecism a concession which is its own refutation.

<h3 id="XI">The consequences</h3>

<p>The fact that this radically intrinsic conception of the spiritual or religious activity of man (this perfect autonomy of the reason <em>vis-&agrave;-vis</em> of what is exterior) is the fundamental <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> conception of the modernists, as the alteration of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> is the essential characteristic of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, can be shown without difficulty by deducting from it their entire system of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. First of all, of their <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">agnosticism</a>: the vague nature which they attribute to our faculties does not permit them, without scientific observation, to arrive at any definite <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> result. Next, of their evolutionism: there is no determined object to assure to dogmatic formulae a permanent and essential meaning compatible with the life of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and progress. Now, from the moment that these formulae simply serve to nourish the vague sentiment which for modernism is the only common and stable foundation of religion, they must change indefinitely with the subjective needs of the believer. It is a right and even a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> for the latter freely to interpret, as he sees fit, religious facts and doctrines. We meet here with the <em>a priorisms</em> to which the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi" drew attention.

<p>We wish to insist a little on the grave consequence that this <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> puts especially before our eyes. In many ways, modernism seems to be on the swift incline which leads to <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a>. It seems to be there on account of its symbolism. After all, is not the affirmation of a personal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> one of these dogmatic formulae which serve only as symbolic expressions of the religious sentiment? Does not the Divine Personality then become something uncertain? Hence radical modernism preaches union and friendship, even with mystical <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a>. Modernism is inclined to <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a> also by its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Divine Immanence that is, of the intimate presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> within us. Does this <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> declare Himself as distinct from us? If so, one must not then oppose the position of modernism to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> position and reject exterior revelation. But if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> declares Himself as not distinct from us, the position of modernism becomes openly <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a>. Such is the dilemma proposed in the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a>. Modernism is <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> also by its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Faith having for object the Unknowable cannot make up for the want of proportion that modernists put between the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and its object. Hence, for the believer as well as for the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, this object remains unknown. Why should not this "Unknowable" be the very <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the world? It is <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> also in its way of reasoning. Independent of and superior to religious formulae, the religious sentiment on the one hand originates them and gives them their entire value, and, on the other hand, it cannot neglect them, it must express itself in them and by them; they are its reality. But we have here the ontology of <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a>, which teaches that the principle does not exist outside of the expression that it gives itself. In the pantheist philosophy, Being or the Idea, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is before the world and superior to it, He creates it and yet He has no reality outside the world; the world is the realization of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="xii">The psychological causes of Modernism</h2>

<p>Curiosity and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> are, according to the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi", two remote causes. Nothing is truer; but, apart from offering an explanation common to all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> obstinacy, we ask ourselves here why this <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> has taken the shape of modernism. We proceed to consider this question. In modernism we find, first of all, the echo of many tendencies of the mentality of the present generation. Inclined to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and distrustful of what is affirmed, men's minds tend of their own accord to minimize the value of dogmatic definitions. Men are struck by the diversity of the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> which exist on the face of the earth. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion is no longer, in their eyes, as it was in the eyes of our ancestors, the morally universal religion of cultured humanity. They have been shown the influence of race on the diffusion of the Gospel. They have been shown the good sides of other cults and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>. Our contemporaries find it hard to believe that the greater part of humanity is plunged in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, especially if they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion teaches that the means of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> are at the disposal of those who <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a>. Hence they are inclined to overlook <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> divergencies in order to insist on a certain fundamental conformity of tendencies and of aspirations.

<p>Then again they are moved by sentiments of <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">liberalism</a> and moderation, which reduce the importance of formal religion, as they see in the various cults only private opinions which change with time and place, and which merit an equal respect from all. In the West where people are of a more practical turn, a non-intellectual interest explains the success of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> which win a certain popularity. Consider the countries in which modernism is chiefly <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>: <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In these two countries, and especially in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority has imposed social and political directions which call for the sacrifice of humanitarian and patriotic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> or dreams. That there are important reasons for such commands does not prevent discontent. The majority of men have not enough virtue or nobility to sacrifice for long, to higher <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, a cause which touches their interest or which engages their sympathy. Hence it is that some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who are not quite steady in their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and religion, attempt to revolt, and count themselves fortunate in having some <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> pretexts to cover their secession.

<p>The founder of the periodical "La Foi Catholique", a review started for the purpose of combating modernism, adds this explanation: "The insufficient cultivation of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> philosophy and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> is the second deep explanation of the origin of modernist <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. Both have too long confined themselves to answers which, though fundamentally correct, are but little suited to the mentality of our adversaries, and are formulated in a language which they do not understand and which is no longer to the point. Instead of utilizing what is quite legitimate in their positive and critical tendencies, they have only considered them as so many abnormal leanings that must be opposed . . ." (Gaudeau, "La Foi Catholique", I, pp. 62-65). Another point is that the intrinsic nature of the movement of contemporary philosophy has been too much despised or ignored in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. They have not given it that partial recognition which is quite consonant with the best scholastic tradition: "In this way, we have failed to secure a real point of contact between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and modern thought" (Gaudeau, ibid.). For lack of professors who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to mark out the actual path of religious <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, many cultured minds, especially among the young <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, found themselves defenseless against an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which seduced them by its speciousness and by any element of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> contained in its reproaches against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. It is scholasticism ill-understood and <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a> that has incurred this disdain. And for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, this is one of the immediate causes of modernism. "Modernism", he says "is nothing but the union of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> philosophy". Cardinal Mercier, on the occasion of his first solemn visit to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a> (8 December, 1907), addressed the following compliment to the professors of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>: "Because, with more good sense than others, you have vigorously kept to objective studies and the calm examination of facts, you have both preserved our <a href="../cathen/01326c.htm">Alma</a> Mater from the strayings of modernism and have secured for her the advantages of modern scientific methods." ("Annuaire de l'Universit&eacute; Catholiquede Louvain", 1908, p. XXV, XXVI.) Saint Augustine (De Genesi contra Manicheos, I, Bk. I, i) in a text that has passed into the Corpus Juris Canonici (c. 40, c. xxiv, q. 3) had already spoken as follows: "Divine Providence suffers many <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of one kind or another, so that their challenges and their questions on doctrines that we are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of, may force us to arise from our indolence and stir us with the desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>." From another point of view, modernism marks a religious reaction against materialism and positivism, both of which fail to satisfy the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> longing. This reaction however, for reasons that have just been given, strays from the right path.

<h2 id="xiii">Pontifical documents concerning Modernism</h2>

<p>The semi-rationalism of several modernists, such as Loisy for instance, had already been condemned in the Syllabus; several canons of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> on the possibility of knowing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through his creatures, on the distinction between <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, on the subordination of human <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> to <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a> on the unchangeableness of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, deal in a similar strain with the tenets of modernism.

<p>The following are the principal decrees or documents expressly directed against modernism. <ul> <li>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> address on 17 April, 1907, to the newly-created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. It is a r&eacute;sum&eacute; which anticipates the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi". <li>A letter from the Congregation of the Index of 29 April, 1907, to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> with regard to the review "Il Rinnovamento". In it we find more concrete notions of the tendencies which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> condemn. The letter even goes so far as to mention the names of Fogazzaro, Father Tyrrell, von H&uuml;gel and the Abbate Murri. <li>Letters from <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, 6 May, 1907, to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and to the patrons of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Institute of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. It shows forth clearly the great and twofold care of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> for the restoration of sacred studies and <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a>, and for the safeguarding of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. <li>The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Lamentabili" of the Holy Office, 3-4 July, 1907, condemning 65 distinct propositions. <li>The injunction of the Holy Office, "Recentissimo", of 28 August, 1907, which with a view to remedying the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, enjoins certain prescriptions upon <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and superiors of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. <li>The <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi", of 8 September, 1907, of which we shall speak later on. <li>Three letters of the Cardinal Secretary of State, of 2 and 10 October, and of 5 November, 1907, on the attendance of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> at secular <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, urging the execution of a general regulation of 1896 on this subject. The <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> had extended this regulation to the whole Church. <li>The condemnation by the Cardinal-Vicar of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of the pamphlet "Il programma dei modernisti", and a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 29 October, 1907, declaring the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of its authors, with special reservations. <li>The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> Motu Proprio of 18 November, 1907, on the value of the decisions of the <a href="../cathen/02557a.htm">Biblical Commission</a>, on the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Lamentabili", and on the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi". These two documents are again confirmed and upheld by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> penalties. <li>The address at the (Consistory of 16 December, 1907. <li>The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Holy Office of 13 February, 1908, in condemnation of the two newspapers, "La Justice sociale" and "La Vie Catholique". Since then several condemnations of the books have appeared. <li>The <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Editae" of 26 May, 1910, renewed the previous condemnations. <li>Still stronger is the tone of the Motu Proprio "Sacrorum Antistitum", of 1 September, 1910, declared: <li>by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Consistorial Congregations of 25 September, 1910. This Motu Proprio inveighs against modernist obstinacy and specious cunning. After having quoted the practical measures prescribed in the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi", the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> urges their execution, and, at the same time, makes new directions concerning the formation of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>. Candidates for higher orders, newly appointed confessors, preachers, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, canons, the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">beneficed</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> staff, <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> preachers, the officials of the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman congregations</a>, or tribunals, superiors and professors in religious congregations, all are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to swear according to a formula which reprobates the principal modernist tenets. <li>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> letter to Prof. Decurtins on literary modernism. </ul>

<p>These acts are for the most part of a disciplinary character (the Motu Proprio of September, 1910, is clearly of the same nature); the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Lamentabili" is entirely <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a>; the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi" and the Motu Proprio of 18 March, 1907, are both <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> and disciplinary in character. Writers do not agree as to the authority of the two principal documents; the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Lamentabili" and the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi". In the present writer's opinion, since the new confirmation accorded to these decrees by the Motu Proprio, they contain in their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> conclusions the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a> teaching of the <a href="../cathen/15403b.htm">Vicar of Jesus Christ</a>. (For a more moderate opinion cf. Choupin in "Etudes", Paris, CXIV, p. 119-120.) The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Lamentabili" has been called the new Syllabus, because it contains the proscription by the Holy Office of 65 propositions, which may be grouped under the following heads: Prop. 1-8, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> concerning the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; Prop. 9-19, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> concerning the inspiration, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and study of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, especially the Gospels; Prop. 20-36, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> concerning revelation and <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>; Prop. 37-38, <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>; Prop. 39-51, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> relative to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; Prop. 52-57, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> concerning the institution and organization of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; Prop. 58-65, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> on <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> evolution. The <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi" in the introduction laid bare the gravity of the danger, pointed out the necessity of firm and decisive action, and approved of the title "Modernism" for the new <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. It gives us first a very methodical exposition of modernism; next follows its general condemnation with a word as to corollaries that may be drawn from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> then goes on to examine the causes and the effects of modernism, and finally seeks the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> remedies. Their application he endeavors to put into practice by a series of energetic measures. An urgent appeal to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> fittingly closes this striking document.
