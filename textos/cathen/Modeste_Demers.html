<h1>Modeste Demers</h1>  

<p>An apostle of the Pacific Coast of North America, and the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionary among most of the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indian tribes</a> of <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, Washington, and <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a>; born at St. Nicholas, Quebec, 11 Oct., 1809; died at <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a>, B. C., 21 July, 1871. His father, Michel Demers, and his mother, Rosalie Foucher were two worthy representatives of the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> farmer class. Endowed with a delicate <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and a distinctly religious disposition, young Demers resolved to enter the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>, and studied first privately and then at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Quebec. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> 7 Feb., 1836, by Bishop Signay, and after fourteen months passed as assistant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Trois-Pistoles, he volunteered for the far-off mission of <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, where the white population, made up mostly of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> employ&eacute;s of the Hudson Bay Company, was clamouring for the ministrations of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Having crossed the American continent in the company of the <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Rev. F.N. Blanchet</a>, his superior, he reached Walla-Walla, on the lower Columbia, 18 Nov., 1838, and immediately applied himself to the care of the lowliest, that is the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indian tribes</a>, which were then very numerous and not any too meek. He studied their languages and visited their homes regularly, preaching, catechizing the adults, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> the children, especially those whose habitat lay to the north of the Columbia. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> even led him on along the coast of <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a>, and in 1842 he proceeded inland as far north as Stuart Lake, evangelizing as he went all the interior tribes of that province.

<p>His companion, the <a href="../cathen/02593a.htm">Rev. F.N. Blanchet</a>, having been elevated to the episcopate, Demers had to submit to what he considered a burden beyond his strength. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on 30 Nov., 1847, and appointed to the spiritual care of <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Vancouver</a> Island, making the incipient town of <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a> his headquarters. As a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he continued his favourite work among the Indians, though he soon had to give his best attention to the rough and cosmopolitan element which now formed his white flock. For its benefit he procured in 1858 the services of the Sisters of St. Anne, who established <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a> and elsewhere, and of the Oblate Fathers, who took in hand the evangelization of the natives and also founded a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> city. In 1866 he assisted at the <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, and shortly afterwards he was one of the fathers of the cumenical Council of the Vatican. He died soon after his return, beloved alike by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and revered for his gentleness and his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> on behalf of the poor and lowly.
