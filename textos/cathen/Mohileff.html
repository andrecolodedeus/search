<h1>Mohileff</h1>  

<p>(Mohyloviensis)

<p>Latin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> archdiocese and <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. For the few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> before the partition of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, some mission stations sufficed. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who came in ambassadorial suites, laboured in <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> from 1648, and in 1691 built the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church there. The free exercise of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, granted in 1706 by Peter the Great, was also allowed by his immediate successors, on condition that the missionaries did not attempt to secure converts. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> also laboured among the immigrant <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with fruitful results. When the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were suppressed in 1773, many of them found a refuge in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. However, no special diocese for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was erected. The partitions of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> brought under Russian sway many hundred thousand <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, whose treatment was in striking contrast to that meted out to the Uniats. While Uniate churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were confiscated and delivered to the Orthodox, and such Uniats as refused to join the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> were subjected to flogging, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, and confiscation of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, policy and shrewdness led the empress to treat the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> very differently. Wishing to attach it to herself, she entrusted the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> with the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of St. Petersburg and the neighbourhood, permitted the foundation of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and released churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> from all taxes.

<p>As in the first partition of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> none of the old Polish sees fell to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, the empress decided to found a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> for her Latin <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> subjects, and to exclude all foreign <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. Without consulting the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, she erected the Diocese of White Russia with Mohileff as its see (1772), and appointed as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Stanislaus Siestrzencewicz Bohusz, Auxiliary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a> (1773). At first <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> refused to recognize this see, mainly on account of the empress's arbitrary action and her <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the Uniats, but finally appointed the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of the new diocese. In 1782 Catharine arbitrarily raised the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> to an archdiocese. After some negotiations, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> recognized the new Archdiocese of Mohileff by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Onerosa pastoralis officii" of 15 April, 1783, which reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the foundation of other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the territory of the archdiocese, extending from the Baltic to the Pacific Ocean. At the second partition of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> (1793) five Latin sees fell to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, Kamenetz, Kieff, Livonia, <a href="../cathen/09463b.htm">Lutzk</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>. Although Catharine had promised in the Treaty of Grodno (1793) to maintain the <em>status quo</em> as regards the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, she arbitrarily suppressed these <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and founded two new ones in places with hardly any <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Part of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the suppressed <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> was confiscated by the State and the rest given to favourites of the empress.

<p>Catharine's son and successor, Paul I, began, directly after his accession, negotiations with <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, with a view to reorganizing the Latin and <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat Churches</a>. Four of the five suppressed <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> (Kamenetz, <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, Lutzik, and Livonia, the last under the title of <a href="../cathen/13421b.htm">Samogitia</a>) were restored, and the new <a href="../cathen/10333a.htm">Diocese of Minsk</a> was founded to replace Kieff. Part of the confiscated <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was restored to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The four old <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, with the new <a href="../cathen/10333a.htm">Diocese of Minsk</a>, were made suffragans of Mohileff, which now became a proper <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>. <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> confirmed this arrangement on 15 November, 1798, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Maximis undique pressi", which forms the substantial basis of the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> today. The Archdiocese of Mohileff did not escape the persecutions to which both the Latin and <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat Churches</a> were almost constantly exposed, especially during the reigns of Nicholas I and Alexander II (see <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">R<font size=-2>USSIA</font></a>). In the hope of weakening the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, which it <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> and barely tolerated, the Government regularly selected aged or compliant men for Mohileff, leaving the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> no option but to confirm its choice. The first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, Siestrzencewicz (b. 1730; d. 1 Dec., 1826), was one of its most pliable tools. Sprung from a noble but impoverished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Lithuanian <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, Siestrzencewicz, after serving in the army, became acquainted with Bishop Mussalki of <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, and through his influence entered the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Mussalki, who never recognized Siestrzencewicz's lack of character, made him a canon and Auxiliary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>.

<p>Ambitious, uninfluenced by motives of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> or conscientious scruples, and <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greedy</a> for power, Siestrzencewicz's sole aim was to curry favour with the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authorities</a> and thus secure despotic power over the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. To limit as far as possible the power of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, he persuaded Tsar Paul I to establish the "College of the Roman Catholic Church", to decide, as final court of appeal, all important matters concerning the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Its decisions had to receive the approval of the ruling senate, and it was furthermore declared the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to submit unconditionally to the will of the emperor in all matters, secular or <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>. The presiding officer of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was Siestrzencewicz, who now established an absolute <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> despotism, appointing to the council only unworthy and subservient men. He granted unlawful <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorces</a> for money, induced Alexander I, Paul's successor, to expel the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> (who had reported to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> unscrupulous conduct), and did not enter the feeblest protest against the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> from the capital in 1815, and from <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in 1820. Casper Casimir Kolumna Cieciszewski (b. 1745), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09463b.htm">Lutzk</a>, succeeded Siestrzencewicz (28 February, 1827; d. 16 April, 1831). His great age prevented him from doing much in face of the series of oppressive measures of Nicholas I, a fanatical adherent of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. These measures which were intended to reduce the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to a condition of servitude, and if possible to exterminate it completely in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, were furthered by the practice of leaving the archdiocese vacant for long periods&mdash;e.g. after the death of Cieciszewski and his successor, Ignaz Ludwig Pawlowski (1841-42; b. 1775).

<p>An expostulatory address presented by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Pope Gregory XVI</a> to the tsar during his visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1845 led to a Concordat, ratified by <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in 1848 and <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, in accordance with which the <a href="../cathen/14739a.htm">Diocese of Tiraspol</a>, with Saratoff as its see, was founded for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colonists in Southern <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and made a suffragan of Mohileff. In December, 1848, Casimir Dmochowski (b. 1772; d. 11 January, 1851) was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. He was succeeded by Ignaz Holowin'ski (1851-5) and Wenceslaus Zylin'ski (1856-63), a tool of the government. Persecution, suppression, and confiscation continued, even after the Concordat, especially under Alexander II. The Diocese of Kamenetz was arbitrarily suppressed in 1855, and Minsk has been vacant since 1869. Under Nicholas II free exercise of religion was granted in 1905, while the edicts of toleration of 17 April and 17 October, 1905, weakened in some measure the privileged position of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>. These alleviations have, however, been since whittled down by the arbitrary conduct of subordinate officials, acting with the tacit approval of the government. The recent <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> are: Antonius Fialkowski (1871-83); Alexander Casimir Dziewaltowski Gintowt (1883-9); Simon Martin Kozlowski (1891-9); Boleslaw Hieronymous Klopotowskli (1901-03); George Joseph Eles&#228;us a Slup&oacute;ff Szembek (1903-5); Appolinaris Waukowski (1909), and Vincentius Kluczn'ski (appointed 5 June, 1910).
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>The suffragans of Mohileff are: Samogitia, Lutzk-Zhitomir, <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a>, and Tirasopol. From 1866 Kamenetz has been administered by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09463b.htm">Lutzk</a>, and from 1869 Minsk by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> is the largest in the world, including three-fourths of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> (the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a> is excluded) and the whole of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> (5,400,000 sq. miles). According to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> statistics for 1910 the archdiocese contains 28 deaneries, 245 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, 399 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 1,023,347 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The administrators of thirty-four other <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> are immediately under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Among these the most important are: Chernigoff (10,600), Tashkent (15,000); and in Siberia: Krasnoyarsk (13,000), Tomsk (10,000), Vladivostok (10,500), etc. The see of the archdiocese is St. Petersburg. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> presides over the Roman <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Collegium, which regulates the relations between the respective <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and the Department of Public Worship, and administers the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The Metropolitan <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> consists of a secretary and four other members; the archdiocesan chapter of a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, dean, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, and six canons; the General Consistory of an official (secular administrator for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>), vice-official, three assessors, visitor of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, <em>Defensor matrimoniorum</em>, and twelve lay members. The <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> academy at St. Petersburg has a <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a>, sixteen <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> and seven secular professors, and 58 students. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> has 2 provisors, a <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a>, inspector, 14 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> and 5 secular professors, 33 <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students, 59 <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, and 31 in the preparatory course. There are no statistics as to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. From 1908 a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> monthly has been published at St. Petersburg.
