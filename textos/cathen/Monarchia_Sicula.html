<h1>Monarchia Sicula</h1>  

<p>A right exercised from the beginning of the sixteenth century by the secular rulers of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, according to which they had final <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in purely religious matters, independent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. This right they claimed on the ground of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> privilege. The oldest document advanced in support of their claim is a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 5 July, 1098, addressed by <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> to Count Roger I of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> (Jaff&eacute;, "Regista Rom. Pont.", I, 2nd ed., n. 5706; latest edition of the text in "Quellen und Forschungen aus italien. Archiven und Bibliotheken", VII, 1904, pp. 214-9). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> agreed not to appoint a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> for <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> against the count's will, and declared his intention of getting executed by the count the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> acts, usually performed by a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> (quinimmo qu&aelig; per legatum acturi sumus, per vestram industriam legati vice exhiberi volumus). Paschal II in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 1 October, 1117, addressed to Count Roger II of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> (Jaff&eacute;, loc. cit., 6562), confirmed this privilege and defined it more clearly. He bestowed upon Roger II the same power, "in the sense that if a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> be sent thither, that is a representative of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, you in your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> shall secure the execution of what the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> is to perform" (ea videlicet ratione, ut si quando illuc ex latere nostro legatus dirigitur, quem profecto vicarium intelligimus, qu&aelig; ab eo gerenda sunt, per tuam industriam effectui mancipentur). <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> had thus granted Apostolic legatine power to the secular rulers; according to the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of Paschal II this meant that, when a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> was sent to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> to exercise <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in certain <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> representative, he must communicate the nature of his commission to the secular ruler, who would then execute in person the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> order in place of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> (<em>legati vice</em>). In both instances it was a question not of a <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the princes of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> independent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, but only of the privilege of the secular rulers to execute the <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the supreme Church authorities; in other words, the sovereign of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> was privileged, but also bound, to carry out <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> regulations in his land.

<p>As a result of the <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> relationship between the princes of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters here took on a more pronouncedly political character than elsewhere, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> was reduced to the greatest dependence upon the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>. However, up to the beginning of the sixteenth century, the privilege bestowed by <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> was never invoked or even mentioned. When Ferdinand II of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> became King of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, his secretary, Luca Barberi of <a href="../cathen/11126a.htm">Noto</a> in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, undertook to collect the official documents by which the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the kings of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, both in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and in secular matters, were clearly determined. To this collection (<em>Capibrevio</em>) was joined a collection of documents under the title "Liber Monarchi&aelig;", meant to prove that the secular rulers of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> had always exercised the spiritual power. In this "Liber Monarchi&aelig;" the privilege conferred by <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> in regard to the legatine power was first published. The kings urged it to give a legal basis to the authority they had long exercised over the local Church. They also used it to extend their pretensions that, by virtue of an old <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> privilege, they possessed <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority in spiritual matters to be exercised independently of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Despite <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> expressed concerning the genuineness of the <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban</a> document, Ferdinand declared on 22 January, 1515: "As for the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Kingdom of Sicily</a>, where we exercise the supervision of spiritual as well as of secular affairs, we have made sure that we do so legitimately". In consequence of such exorbitant demands, disputes arose between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and the rulers of the island. <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> negotiated with <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> concerning the Monarchia Sicula, but without success. In 1578 Philip II tried vainly to obtain a formal confirmation of the right from <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>. In 1597 the king appointed a special permanent judge (<em>Judex Monarchi&oelig; Sicul&oelig;</em>), who was to give final decisions in the highest <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> causes, an appeal from his judgment to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> being forbidden. The <em>Judex Monarchi&oelig; Sicul&oelig;</em> claimed the general right to visit the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, supreme <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the exercise of a number of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> belonging to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, so that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> was almost wholly excluded.

<p>When <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, in an excursus on the year 1097 in the eleventh volume of his "Annales ecclesiastici" (Rome, 1605), produced solid reasons against the genuineness of <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II's</a> <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> and especially against the legality of the Monarchia Sicula, a violent feud arose, and the Court of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> prohibited the eleventh volume from all countries of the Spanish Empire. <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> omitted the excursus in the second edition of the "Annales" (Antwerp, 1608), but published instead a special "Tractatus de Monarchia Sicula". During the War of the Spanish Succession another serious conflict arose between the Papal <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> and the Spanish court in regard to this alleged legatine power. The occasion of the dispute was a question of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> immunity, and the differences continued after Count Victor Amadeus had been made King of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> by the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> and had been <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> at Palermo (1713). On 20 February, 1715, <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> declared the Monarchia Sicula null and void, and revoked the privileges attached to it. This edict was not recognized by the monarchs of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and, when a few years later the island came under the rule of Charles VI, <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> entered into negotiations with him with the result that the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> was withdrawn, and the Monarchia Sicula restored, but in an altered form. The king, through the concession of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> could now appoint the <em>Judex Monarchi&oelig; Sicul&oelig;</em>, who was at the same time to be the delegate of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and empowered to decide in the last instance upon religious matters. On the basis of this concession the kings of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> demanded more and more far reaching <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, so that fresh struggles with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> constantly arose. The situation grew ever more unbearable. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> tried in vain by amicable adjustments to enforce the essential <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. Garibaldi, as "Dictator" of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, claimed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, and, during the service in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, caused legatine honours to be shown him. In the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Suprema" of 28 January, 1864, which was not published with the prescriptions for its execution until 10 October, 1867, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> revoked the Monarchia Sicula finally and forever. The government of Victor Emanuel protested, and the <em>Judex Monarchi&oelig; Sicul&oelig;,</em> Rinaldi, refused to submit, for which he was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> in 1868. Article 15 of the Italian law of guarantees (13 May 1871) explicitly revoked the Monarchia Sicula, and the question was thus finally disposed of.
