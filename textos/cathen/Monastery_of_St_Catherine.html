<h1>Monastery of St. Catherine</h1>  

<p>Situated on <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>, at an altitude of 4854 feet, in a picturesque gorge below the Jebel-Musa, the reputed Mountain of the Law. This Byzantine <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, perhaps the most interesting of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Christian Orient</a>, is under the <a href="../cathen/02322a.htm">Rule of St. Basil</a>, and is well-known for its hospitality. It is chiefly famous, however, on account of its <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, in which was discovered the <a href="../cathen/04085a.htm">Codex Sinaiticus</a>, a valuable Biblical <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the fourth century. Although now in a state of decay, the Monastery of St. Catherine is still held in great veneration by the Orthodox Greeks, both because it is believed to contain the remains of the famous virgin of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, and because of its intimate connection with some of the most sublime events recorded in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. In a little oratory where a lamp is kept always burning, and which is only to be entered unshod, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> show the supposed location of the Burning Bush. The earliest known historical fact is the erection of a church by Emperor Justinian about A.D. 550. A Byzantine <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a>, which is still in existence, shows that this was formerly called the church of the Transfiguration; here were gathered the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> who had previously lived in separate cells and caves among the rocks of <a href="../cathen/14011a.htm">Mount Sinai</a>. It is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> when or how the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> obtained possession of the remains of St <a href="../cathen/03445a.htm">Catherine of Alexandria</a> and adopted her name. According to legend her body was transported thither by the hands of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. The name, however, does not appear in literature before the tenth century. To protect the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was fortified like a castle, the exterior wall of which forms a quadrangle resting on solid rock. The fact that a castle presupposes a military force accounts for the mention some authors make of a <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military order</a> of St. Catherine, founded in 1063, which would thus antedate any other <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military order</a>. No trace has been found, however, of the rule of any such order, or of a list of its grand masters. From the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Catherine attracted many Latin <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, who gradually formed a brotherhood, the members of which pretended to the knighthood. In return for a vague promise to protect sacred shrines and <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, they were granted the coveted St. Catherine's Cross, a cross inserted in the wheel of St. Catherine. See <a href="../cathen/03445a.htm">Catherine of Alexandria</a>; Sinai; <a href="../cathen/09627a.htm">manuscripts of the Bible</a>.
