<h1>Monastery of Weissenau</h1>  

<p>(Originally OWE_AUGIA, then MINDERLAU-AUGIA MINOR, and finally WEISSEN AU-AUGIA ALBA or CANDIDA).

<p>A suppressed <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> house near Ravensburg in Wurtemberg, founded in 1145 by Gebizo of Ravensburg, a <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphic</a> ministerial, and his sister Luitgarde. Its first <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and their <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> Herman (1145-75) came from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Rot (Monchsrot), near Memmingen. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was completed in 1156, and in 1172 the church was dedicated to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> and St. Peter by Bishop Otto of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, to whose diocese it then belonged. The number of canons at Weissenau increased so rapidly that in 1183 the newly founded <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Schussenried was recruited from there. In 1257 Weissenau was raised to the rank of an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, with Henry I (1257- 66) as its first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. From the time of its foundation in 1145 till its secularization in 1802, Weissenau continued uninterruptedly as a <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. During the first few years of its existence it had a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> attached, but this was transferred to the neighbouring Weissenthal by Provost Herman and existed there until the fifteenth century. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries Weissenau was repeatedly pillaged by feudatories and passing military troops; its most severe trial came during the <a href="../cathen/11597a.htm">Peasants' War</a>, when the canons were temporarily driven from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Jacob Murer (1523-33), replaced by the peasant, Johann Wetzel. Abbot Leopold Mauch (1704-22) began the rebuilding of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in 1708 and of the church in 1717. The church, which is in the Barocco style, was completed in 1724 by his successor, Michael Helmling (1722-4), and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> by Anton Unold (1724-65). In all, Weissenau had eight provosts and forty-one <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>. Its last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Bonaventure Brem (1794-1802), died on 4 August, 1818. At the time of its secularization (1802) it had twenty-seven canons, who administered the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Weissenau, St. Jodock, Bodnegg, Grunkraut, Thaldorf, St. Christian, Gornhofen, Obereschach, and Obereisenbach. Its possessions comprised 198 estates and its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> extended over 137 villages. After its secularization it became the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the Count of Sternberg-Manderscheid, upon whose death it was bought back by the Government of Wurtemberg in 1835, but resold and turned into a dressmaking and bleaching concern. Since 1892 the buildings are used as an asylum for the insane.

<p>Weissenau acquired considerable fame on account of the reputed <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the Precious Blood which it received from Rudolph of Habsburg in 1283. Up to 1783 the famous <em>Blutritt</em>, similar to that of the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/15576b.htm">Weingarten</a>, took place every year. It consisted in a solemn procession during which the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> was borne by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on horseback, accompanied by many other riders and a large crowd of people. The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> is still preserved in the old <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church, which now serves as the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Weissenau. References to this <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> is made in "Lohengrin" (ed. G&ouml;rres, p. 84).
