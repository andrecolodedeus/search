<p>DIOCESE OF MONDOV&Igrave; (MONTISREGALIS)

<p>Located in <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, province of <a href="../cathen/04569b.htm">Cuneo</a>, northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The city is built upon three hills, at a height of about 1600 feet above sea-level, and dates from the year 1000; but the suburb of Breo, the name of which recalls the Bredolensis colony mentioned in a Roman inscription found in that neighbourhood, had a castle in the time of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. The town, called Monsvici, also Monteregale, was under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02018b.htm">Asti</a> until 1198, when it established itself as a commune, but was compelled to struggle against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02018b.htm">Asti</a>, the marquesses of <a href="../cathen/13405c.htm">Saluzzo</a> and of Monferrato and the counts of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, in turn recognizing and shaking off the suzerainty of one or another of those lords. The commune maintained a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the marquesses of Civa (1240-50), and finally, Bressano di Vico, a powerful lord in Mondov&igrave;, attempted to make himself master of the city, which submitted to Charles of Anjou (1260), and from that time, with some interruptions, remained under the protection of the kings of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, until 1366. In 1396, having again changed lords several times, it came under the dominion of the <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoyard</a> lords of <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>, and in 1418, under that of the dukes of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, in whose possession it remained. In 1476 and in 1533, the inhabitants of Mondov&igrave; attempted to give their allegiance either to the Marquess of Monferrato or to the Duke of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, and the French contested for its possession with the imperialists (1536-43), and with the house of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> (1543-59). The city was at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Duke of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> for the salt monopoly (1678-99). <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> defeated the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> near Mondov&igrave; (1796), thereby assuring his way through the valley of the Po, and in 1799 it was pillaged by the French.

<p>It was the birthplace of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/02645b.htm">Cardinal Bona</a>, of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physicist</a> Beccaria, and of Marquess Ormea, a statesman of the eighteenth century. Its <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> contains <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/06572a.htm">Giulio Romano</a>, <a href="../cathen/03209b.htm">Cambiaso</a>, and others. The residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is one of the noblest episcopal palaces in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In the church of la Missione there are frescoes by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Pozzi. Outside the city is the sanctuary of the Madonna del Pilone, dating from the fourteenth century, but finished later (1730-49). The palace of the counts of San Quintino contained the first printing-office in <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, and was the seat of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> (1560-1719) founded by Duke Emmanuel Philibert, the first institution of its kind in <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>. The city, at first part of the <a href="../cathen/02018b.htm">Diocese of Asti</a>, became the seat of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, suffragan of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, but, since 1515, <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> has been its <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. In 1817, the territory of <a href="../cathen/04569b.htm">Cuneo</a> was detached from the See of Mondov&igrave;, and made a diocese. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Mondov&igrave; was Damiano Zavaglia, a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and peace-loving <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>; among his successors were Percivallo di Palma (1429), Amadeo Romagnano (1497), who reconstructed the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (1550); Michele Ghislieri, O.P. (1550), later Pope Pius V; Cardinal Vincenzo Lauro (1566), founder of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, during whose incumbency the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and other churches were torn down to make room for the citadel; Giovanni Battista Isnardi (1697), who restored the episcopal palace and the church of St. Dalmazaio; Carlo Felice Sanmartino (1741), founder of the new <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, and Giovanni Tommaso Ghilardi, O.P. (1842), a very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and charitable man. The city contains 145 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with 170,000 <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, 6 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 10 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> for boys and 15 for girls; it has three <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspapers.
