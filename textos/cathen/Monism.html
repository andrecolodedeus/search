<h1>Monism</h1>  

<p>(From the Greek <em>monos</em>, "one", "alone", "unique").

<p>Monism is a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> term which, in its various meanings, is opposed to <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a> or Pluralism. Wherever pluralistic philosophy distinguishes a multiplicity of things, Monism denies that the manifoldness is real, and holds that the apparently many are phases, or phenomena, of a one. Wherever <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a> philosophy distinguishes between body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, matter and spirit, object and subject, matter and force, the system which denies such a distinction, reduces one term of the antithesis to the other, or merges both in a higher unity, is called Monism.
<h2 id="section1">In metaphysics</h2>

<p>The ancient <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindu</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> stated as a fundamental <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that the world of our sense-experience is all illusion (<em>maya</em>), that change, plurality, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causation</a> are not real, that there is but one reality, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This is metaphysical Monism of the <em>idealistic-spiritual</em> type, tending towards <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>.

<p>Among the early Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, the Eleatics, starting, like the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a>, with the conviction that sense-knowledge is untrustworthy, and reason alone reliable, reached the conclusion that change, plurality, and origination do not really exist, that Being is one, immutable, and eternal. They did not explicitly identify the one reality with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and were not, so far as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, inclined to <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>. Their Monism, therefore, may be said to be of the <em>purely idealistic</em> type.

<p>These two forms of metaphysical Monism recur frequently in the history of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; for instance, the idealistic-spiritual type in <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonism</a> and in <a href="../cathen/14217a.htm">Spinoza's</a> <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>, and the purely idealistic type in the rational absolutism of <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a>.

<p>Besides idealistic Monism there is Monism of the materialistic type, which proclaims that there is but one reality, namely, matter, whether matter be an agglomerate of atoms, a primitive, world-forming substance (see <a href="../cathen/08092a.htm">I<font size=-2>ONIAN</font> S<font size=-2>CHOOL OF</font> P<font size=-2>HILOSOPHY</font></a>), or the so-called cosmic nebula out of which the world evolved.

<p>There is another form of metaphysical Monism, represented in these days by Haeckel and his followers, which, though materialistic in its scope and tendency, professes to transcend the point of view of materialistic Monism and unite both matter and mind in a higher something. The weak point of all metaphysical Monism is its inability to explain how, if there is but one reality, and everything else is only apparent there can be any real changes in the world, or real relations among things. This difficulty is met in <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a> systems of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form, or <a href="../cathen/01124a.htm">potency and actuality</a>, which are the ultimate realities in the metaphysical order. Pluralism rejects the solution offered by scholastic <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> and strives, with but little success, to oppose to Monism its own theory of synechism or <a href="../cathen/11446a.htm">panpsychism</a> (see <a href="../cathen/12333b.htm">P<font size=-2>RAGMATISM</font></a>). The chief objection to materialistic Monism is that it stops short of the point where the real problem of <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> begins.
<h2 id="section2">In theology</h2>

<p>The term <em>Monism</em> is not much used in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> because of the confusion to which its use would lead. <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">Polytheism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that there are many gods, has for its opposite <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">Monotheism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that there is but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If the term Monism is employed in place of <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">Monotheism</a>, it may, of course, mean Theism, which is a <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheistic</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, or it may mean <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, which is opposed to theism. In this sense of the term, as a synonym for <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, Monism maintains that there is no real distinction between <a href="../cathen/06614a.htm">God and the universe</a>. Either <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is indwelling in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> as a part of it, not distinct from it (<a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> Immanentism), or the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> does not exist at all as a reality (Acosmism), but only as a manifestation or phenomenon of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. These views are vigorously combated by Theism, not only on considerations of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> and philosophy, but also on considerations of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> and conduct. For the <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> implications of <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a> are as detrimental to it as its shortcomings from the point of view of consistency and reasonableness. Theism does not deny that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is indwelling in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; but it does deny that He is comprised in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Theism does not deny that the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is a manifestation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but it does deny that the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> has no reality of its own. Theism is, therefore, <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a>: it holds that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a reality distinct from the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> and independent of it, and that the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is a reality distinct from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though not independent of Him. From another point of view, theism is monistic; it maintains that there is but One Supreme Reality and that all other reality is derived from Him. <em>Monism</em> is not then an adequate equivalent of the term <em>Theism</em>.
<h2 id="section3">In psychology</h2>


<p>The central problem of rational <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> is the question of the relation between <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a>, following <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, maintains, that man is one substance, composed of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which are respectively <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the principle of life, energy, and perfection; the body is the principle of decay, potentiality, and imperfection. These two are not complete substances: their union is not accidental, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> thought, but substantial. They are, of course, really distinct, and even separable; yet they act on each other and react. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, even in its highest functions, needs the co-operation, at least extrinsic, of the body, and the body in all its vital functions is energized by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as the radical principle of those functions. They are not so much two in one as two forming one compound. In popular <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> this <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> may be exaggerated; in the mind of the extreme ascetic it sometimes is exaggerated to the point of placing a too sharp contrast between "the flesh" and "the spirit", "the beast" and "the angel", in us.

<p>Psychological Monism tends to obliterate all distinction between body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. This it does in one of three ways. <ul><li>(A) Monism of the materialistic type reduces the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to matter or material conditions, and thus, in effect, denies that there is any distinction between <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. The <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> described the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as a part of the material world-substance; the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a> held that it is a compound of material atoms; modern <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialism</a> knows no substantial <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> except the nervous system; Cabanis, for instance, proclaims his materialism in the well-known Crude formula: "The brain digests impressions, and organically secretes thought." <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">Psychological</a> materialism, as metaphysical materialism, closes its eyes to those phenomena of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which it cannot explain, or even denies that such phenomena exist. <li>(B) Monism of the idealistic type takes an entirely opposite course. It reduces the body to mind or <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> conditions. Some of the <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonists</a> held that all matter is non-existent, that our body is, therefore, an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> on the part of our minds, and that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone is the <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>.

<p>John <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> Eriugena, influenced by the <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonists</a>, held the body to be a resultant from incorporeal qualities which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by thinking them and synthesizing them, creates into a body for itself. In modern times, Berkeley included the human body in his general denial of the reality of matter, and maintained that there are no substances except the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The grounds for this <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> are <a href="../cathen/05506a.htm">epistemological</a>. <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">Psychological</a> Monism runs counter to common sense and experience. Historically, it is a reaction against materialism. To refute materialism it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to deny that the body is a reality. The unreflecting <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> of common sense and the scientific <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> which the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> built on the facts of experience steer a safe and consistent course between the hasty generalization of the <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialist</a>, who sees nothing but body, and the bold paradox of the Idealist, who recognizes no reality except mind. <li>(C) A third kind of <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> Monism goes by the name of psychophysical parallelism. It maintains two principles, the one negative and the other affirmative. First, it denies categorically that there is, or can be, any direct causal influence of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on the body or of the body on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: our thoughts cannot produce the movements of our muscles, neither can the action of light on the retina produce in us the "thought" of a colour. Secondly, it affirms in some shape or form that both the body and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are phases of something else, that this something evolves its activities along two parallel lines, the physical and the psychical, so that the thought, for instance, of moving my hand is synchronous with the motion of my hand, without one in any way influencing the other. This is the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Occasionalists who, like <a href="../cathen/09568a.htm">Malebranche</a>, maintain that the union of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body "consists in a mutual and natural correspondence of the thoughts of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the processes of the brain, and of the emotions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the movements of the animal spirits" (Rech. de la V&eacute;rit&eacute;, II, v). It is the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/14217a.htm">Spinoza</a>, whose metaphysical Monism compelled him to hold that body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are merely aspects of the one substance, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, under the attributes extension and thought, but that they unfold their modes of activity in a manner preordained to correspondence (Eth., II, ii, schol.). Leibniz meets the difficulty in his own characteristic way by teaching that all <a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">monads</a> are partly material and partly immaterial, and that among all <a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">monads</a> and their activities there exists a pre-established harmony (see <a href="../cathen/09134b.htm">L<font size=-2>EIBNIZ</font></a>; <a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">M<font size=-2>ONAD</font></a>). In the so-called <em>Identit&auml;tsphilosophic</em> of some German Transcendentalists, such as Schelling, reality is mind in so far as it is active, and matter in so far as it is passive; mind and matter are, therefore, two harmonious, but independent, series of phases of reality. Fechner's view is similar: he holds that the reality pervading the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is at once physical and psychical, that the physical is the "exterior" and the psychical the "interior", or "inner", side of reality, and that the body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in man are but one instance of a parellelism which prevails everywhere in nature. Paulsen ("Introd. to Phil.", tr. Thilly, 87 sqq.) holds that "two propositions are contained in the theory of parallelism: (I) Physical processes are never effects of psychical processes; (2) Psychical processes are never effects of physical processes." He adopts Fechner's <a href="../cathen/11446a.htm">panpsychism</a>, maintaining that "everything corporeal points to something else, an inner, intelligible element, a being for itself, which is akin to what we experience within ourselves". Both the corporeal and the "inner" are parts of the universal system, which is the body of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, though they do not interact, they act in such a way that harmony results.</ul>

<p>Herbert Spencer uses the word <em>parallelism</em> in a slightly different sense: the separate impressions of the senses and the stream of inner conscious states must be adjusted by the activity of the mind, if the two series are to be of any use to the developing or evolving animal or man; that is, there must be a parallelism between a certain physical evolution and the correlative psychical evolution" (Principles of Psych., n. 179), while both mind and matter are mere "symbols of some form of Power absolutely and forever unknown to us" (op. cit., n. 63). This <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> finds favour among the evolutionists generally, and has one distinct advantage: it obviates the necessity of explaining many phenomena of mind which could not be accounted for by the principles of materialistic evolution. Thus, under the name "double-aspect theory" it is adopted by Clifford, Bain, Lewes, and Huxley. Among empirical <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychologists</a> parallelism has been found satisfactory as a "working hypothesis". Experience, it is maintained, tells us nothing of a substantial <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that acts on the body and is acted upon. It does tell us, however, that psychical states are apparently conditioned by bodily states, and that states of body apparently influence states of mind. For the purposes of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, conclude the empiricists, it is enough to maintain as an empirical formula that the two streams of activity are, so to speak, parallel, though never confluent. There is no need to ground the formula on any universal metaphysical theory, such as the pan-psychism of Fechner and Paulsen. It is enough that, as Wundt points out, the facts of experience establish a correspondence between physical and psychical, while the dissimilarity of the physical and the psychical precludes the possibility of one being the cause of the other. To all these parallelistic explanations of the relations between <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> dualists take exception. First, the scholastics call attention to the verdict of experience. Up to a certain point, the facts of experience are capable of a parallelistic, as well as of a <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a>, explanation. But when we come to consider the unity of consciousness, which is a fact of experience, we find that the theory of parallelism breaks down, and the only explanation that holds is that of dualists, who maintain the substantiality of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Secondly, if the parallelistic theory be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, what, ask the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> dualists, becomes of the freedom of the will and moral responsibility? If our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> and bodily states are not to be referred to an immediate personal subject, but are considered phases or aspects of a universal substance, a cosmic <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, mind-stuff, or unknown "form of Power", it is not easy to see in what sense the will can be free, and man be held responsible for his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> or bodily acts.

<p>In a minor sense the word <em>monism</em> is sometimes used in <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> to designate the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that there is no real distinction between the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and its faculties. <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">Psychological</a> <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> holds that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body are distinct, though incomplete, substances. But how about the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself? <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that it has three parts has had very little following in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> distinguished between the substance of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and its powers (<em>dynameis</em>), or faculties, and bequeathed to the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> the problem whether these faculties are really, or only notionally, distinct from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself. Those who favour the real distinction are sometimes called pluralists in <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a>, and their opponents, who say that the distinction is nominal or, at most, notional, are sometimes called <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> Monists. The question is decided by inferences from the facts of consciousness. Those who hold real distinction of function argue that this is sufficient ground for a real distinction of faculties.
<h2 id="section4">In epistemology</h2>

<p>As in <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a>, Monism is used in various senses to signify, in a general way, the antithesis of <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualist</a> in <a href="../cathen/05506a.htm">epistemology</a> agrees with the ordinary observer, who distinguishes both in theory and in practice between "things" and "thoughts". Common sense, or unreflecting consciousness, takes things generally to be what they seem. It acts on the conviction that the internal world of our thoughts corresponds with the external world of reality. The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> dualist questions the extent and accuracy of that correspondence; he learns from <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> that many instances of so-called immediate perception have in them a large share of interpretation, and are, in so far, referable to the activity of the mind. Nevertheless, he sees no reason to quarrel with the general verdict of common sense that there is a world of reality outside us, as well as a world of representation within us, and that the latter corresponds in a measure to the former. He distinguishes, therefore, between subject and object, between self and not-self, and holds that the external world exists. The Monist in one way or another eliminates the objective from the field of reality, obliterates the distinction between self and not-self, and denies that the external world is real. Sometimes he takes the ground of <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">idealism</a>, maintaining that thoughts are things, that the only reality is perception, or rather, that a thing is real only in the sense that it is perceived, <em>esse est percipi</em>. He scornfully rejects the view of na&iuml;ve realism, refers with contempt to the copy-theory (the view that our thoughts represent things) and is rather proud of the fact that he is in conflict with common sense. Sometimes he is a solipsist, holding that self alone exists, that the existence of not-self is an illusion, and that the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the existence of other minds than our own is a vulgar <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Sometimes, finally, he is an acosmist: he denies that the external world exists except in so far as it is thought to exist: or he affirms that we create our own external world out of our own thoughts.

<p>However, the classical forum of <a href="../cathen/05506a.htm">epistemological</a> Monism at the present time is known as Absolutism. Its fundamental tenet is metaphysical monism of the purely idealistic type. It holds that both subject and object are merely phases of an abstract, unlimited, impersonal consciousness called the <a href="../cathen/01060c.htm">Absolute</a>; that neither things nor thoughts have any reality apart from the <a href="../cathen/01060c.htm">Absolute</a>. It teaches that the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is a rational and systematic whole, consisting of an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> "ground" and multiform "appearances" of that ground, one appearance being what the Realist calls things, and another what the Realist calls thoughts. This is the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegelians</a>, from <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a> himself down to his latest representatives, Bradley and McTaggart. All these forms of <a href="../cathen/05506a.htm">epistemological</a> Monism &mdash; namely, <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">idealism</a>, solipsism, acosmism, and absolutism &mdash; have, of course, metaphysical bearings, and sometimes rest on metaphysical foundations. Nevertheless, historically speaking, they are traceable to a <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> assumption which is, and always will be, the dividing line between <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a> and Monism in <a href="../cathen/05506a.htm">epistemology</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualists</a>, in their analysis of the act of knowing, call attention to the fact that in every process of perception the object is immediately given. It seems like emphasizing the obvious to say so, yet it is precisely on this point that the whole question turns. What I perceive is not a sensation of whiteness but a white object. What I taste is not the sensation of sweetness but a sweet substance. No matter how much the activity of the mind may elaborate, synthesize, or reconstruct the data of sense-perception, the objective reference cannot be the result of any such subjective activity; for it is given originally in consciousness. On the contrary, the Monist starts with the idealistic assumption that what we perceive is the sensation. Whatever objective reference the sensation has in our consciousness is conferred on it by the activity of the mind. The objective is, therefore, reducible to the subjective; things are thoughts; we make our world. In the dualist's analysis there is immediate, presentative contact in consciousness between the subject and the object. In the Monist's account of the matter there is a chasm between subject and object which must be bridged over somehow. The problem of <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a> or Monism in <a href="../cathen/05506a.htm">epistemology</a> depends, therefore, for solution on the question whether perception is presentative or representative; and the dualist, who holds the presentative theory, seems to have on his side the verdict of introspective <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> as well as the approval of common sense.

<p>In recent Pragmatist contributions to <a href="../cathen/05506a.htm">epistemology</a> there is presented a different view of <a href="../cathen/05506a.htm">epistemological</a> Monism from that given in the preceeding paragraphs, and a solution is offered which differs entirely from that of traditional <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a>. In William James's works, for instance, Monism is described as that species of Absolutism which "thinks that the all-form or collective-unit form is the only form that is rational", while opposed to it is Pluralism, that is, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that "the each-form is an eternal form of reality no less than it is the form of temporal appearance" (A Pluralistic Universe, 324 sqq.). The multitude of "each-forms" constitute, not a chaos, but a cosmos, because they are "inextricably interfused" into a system. The unity, however, which exists among the "each-forms" of reality is not an integral unity nor an articulate or organic, much less a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>, unity. It is a unity "of the strung-along type, the type of continuity, contiguity, or concatenation" (op. cit., 325). Into this unfinished <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, into this stream of successive experiences, the subject steps at a certain moment. By a process which belongs, not to <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, but to life, which exceeds <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, he connects up these experiences into a concatenated series. In other words, he strings the single beads on a string, not of thought, but of the practical needs and purposes of life. Thus the subject makes his own world, and, really, we are not any better off than if we accepted the verdict of the intellectualistic Idealist. We have merely put the practical reason in place of the theoretical: so far as the value of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is concerned the antithesis between Monism and Pluralism is more apparent than real, and the latter is as far from the saneness of realistic <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a> as the former. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the Pluralist admits, in a sense, the existence of the external world; but so also does the Absolutist. The trouble is that neither admits it in a sense which would save the distinction between subject and object. For the Pluralist as well as the Monist is entangled in the web of subjective <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">Idealism</a> as soon as he favours the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that perception is representative, not presentative.
<h2 id="section5">In cosmology</h2>

<p>The central question is the origin of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. The early Ionian <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> assigned, as the cause or principle (<em>arche</em> is the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelian</a> word) of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, a substance which is at once the material out of which the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is made and the force by which it was made. As <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> says, they failed to distinguish between the material cause and the efficient cause. They were, therefore, <a href="../cathen/05222a.htm">dynamists</a> and <a href="../cathen/07594a.htm">hylozoists</a>. That is, they held matter to be of its <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> active, and endowed with life. Without the aid of any extrinsic force, they said, the original substance, by a process of thickening and thinning, or by quenching and kindling, or in some other immanent way, gave rise to the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> as we now see it. This primitive cosmothetic Monism gradually gave way to a <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a> conception of the origin of the world. Tentatively at first, and then more decisively, the later Ionians introduced the notion of a primitive force, distinct from matter, which fashioned the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> out of the primordial substance. Anaxagoras it was, who, by clearly defining this force and describing it as mind (<em>nous</em>), earned the encomium of being the "first of the ancient <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who spoke sense". <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a>, thus introduced, withstood the onslaughts of materialistic <a href="../cathen/02053a.htm">Atomism</a> and <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureanism</a>, <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoicism</a> and emanationistic <a href="../cathen/10742b.htm">neo-Platonism</a>. It was developed by <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, who brought to their description of the world-forming process a higher notion of cosmothetic mind than the pre-Socratic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> possessed. It was left for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and their successors, the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a>, to elaborate the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of creation <em>ex nihilo</em>, and thus bring out more clearly the r&ocirc;le played by the Divine Power and Will in the formation of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. The order, harmony, and purposiveness evident everywhere in nature are cited by the creationists as evidence to show that mind must have presided at the origination of things. Furthermore, the question of dynamism or mechanism hinges on the problem of the nature of matter. This phase of the question has been developed especially in post-Cartesian philosophy, some maintaining that matter is essentially inert and must, therefore, have acquired force and activity from without, while others as stoutly maintain that matter is by nature active and, consequently, may have developed its own force from within. Evolution of the thorough going type takes the latter view. It holds that in the primitive cosmic matter was contained "the power and potency" of all life and movement, in such a way that no external agent was required in order to bring it to actual existence. Here, as in the question of Theism, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> philosophy is frankly <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a>, although it acknowledges that, since actuality antecedes potency by nature and, as a matter of fact, the world originated in time, while <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is eternal, there was, before creation, but One Reality.
<h2 id="section6">In ethics</h2>

<p>The word <em>Monism</em> is very little used. In some German works it is employed to designate the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that the moral law is autonomous. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ethics is essentially heteronomic: it teaches that all law, even <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, emanates from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantian</a> ethics and Evolutionistic ethics hold that the moral law is either self-imposed or emanates from the moral sense which is a product of the struggle for existence. In both the <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantian</a> and the Evolutionistic systems there is only one source of the power of moral discrimination and approval. For this reason the word <em>Monism</em> is here used in its generic sense. In English <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> literature, however, the word has no such signification. In accounting for the origin of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, a problem which, though it belongs to <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>, has important bearings on <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> questions, some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have adopted a Dualistic <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and explained that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> originate from two distinct principles, the one supremely good, the other completely and absolutely <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. This was the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the ancient <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, from whom it was borrowed by Manes, the founder of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichean sect</a>. Opposed to this is the Monistic view, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is indeed the cause of all that is good in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not to be assigned to any supreme cause distinct from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Whatever explanation be given of the existence of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the world, it is maintained that a supreme principle of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is utterly impossible and even inconceivable.
<h2 id="section7">Contemporary monistic movements and schools</h2>

<p>In current <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> literature, whenever no special qualification is added, Monism generally means the modified materialistic monism of Haeckel. Modern materialistic Monism in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> begins with Feuerbach, a disciple of <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a>. Feuerbach was followed by Vogt and Moleschott. To these succeeded Haeckel, who combines Darwinian evolution with a materialistic interpretation of <a href="../cathen/14217a.htm">Spinoza</a> and Bruno. Haeckel's works, both in the original and in English translations, have had a wide circulation, their popularity being due rather to the superficial manner in which Haeckel disposes of the most serious questions of <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> than to any intrinsic excellence of content or method. Haeckel is honorary president of the Monistenbund (Society of Monists), founded at Jena in 1906, for the purpose of propagating the doctrines of Monism. The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is openly anti-Christian, and makes active <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Its publications, "Der Monist" (a continuation of the "Freie Glocken" &mdash; first number, 1906), "Bl&auml;tter des deutschen Monistenbunds" (first number, July, 1906), and various pamphlets (Flugbl&auml;tter des Monistenbunds), are intended to be a campaign against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and the union of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>.

<p>The group of writers in America who, under the editorship of Dr. Paul Carus, have been identified with the "Monist" (Chicago, monthly, first number, Jan., 1891) are not, apparently, actuated by the same animosity against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Nevertheless, they hold Haeckel's fundamental tenet that Monism as a system of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> transcends <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> as a form of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, and is the only rational synthesis of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and religion. "Religious progress no less than <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> progress", writes Carus, "is a process of growth as well as a cleansing from mythology. . . . Religion is the basis of ethics. . . . The ideal of religion is the same as that of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, it is a liberation of the mythological elements and its aim is to rest upon a concise but exhaustive statement of facts" (Monism, Its Scope and Import, 8, 9). This "concise but exhaustive statement of facts" is positive Monism, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, namely, that the whole of reality constitutes one inseparable and indivisible entirety. Monism is not the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that one substance alone, whether it be mind or matter, exists: such a theory, says Dr. Carus, is best designated as Henism. True Monism "bears in mind that our words are abstracts representing parts or features of the One and All, and not separate existences" (op. cit., 7). This Monism is Positivistic, because its aim is "the systematisation of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that is, of a description of facts" (ibid.). "Radical free thought" is the motto of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Monism; at the same time, it disclaims all sympathy with destructive <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheism</a>, <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a>, <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialism</a>, and Negativism in general. Nevertheless, the untrained student of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> will be likely to be more profoundly influenced by the Monistic criticism of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> than by the constructive effort to put something in place of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> referred to.

<p>All Monism may be described as resulting from the tendency of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to discover unitary concepts under which to subsume the manifold of experience. So long as we are content to take and preserve the world of our experience as we find it, with all its manifoldness, variety, and fragmentation, we are in the condition of primitive man, and little better than brute animals. As soon as we begin to reflect on the data of the senses, we are led by an <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> of our rational nature to reduce manifold effects to the unity of a causal concept. This we first do in the scientific plane. Afterwards, carrying the process to a higher plane, we try to unify these under <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> categories, such as <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> and <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, matter and force, body and mind, subject and object. The history of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, however, shows with unmistakable clearness that there is a limit to this unifying process in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. If <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a> were right, and the formula, "The rational alone is real", were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, then we should expect to be able to compass all reality with the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> powers which we possess. But, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> philosophy holds, the real extends beyond the domain of the (finite) rational. Reality eludes our attempt to compress it within the categories which we frame for it. Consequently, <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a> is often the final answer in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; and Monism, which is not content with the partial synthesis of <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a>, but aims at an ideal completeness, often results in failure. <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">Dualism</a> leaves room for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and hands over to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> many of the problems which philosophy cannot solve. Monism leaves no room for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The only <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> that is compatible with it is <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a>, and very different from that "vision" in which, for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mystic, all the limitations, imperfections, and other shortcomings of our feeble efforts are removed by the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.
