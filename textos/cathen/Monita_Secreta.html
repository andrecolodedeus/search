<h1>Monita Secreta</h1>  

<p>A code of instructions alleged to be addressed by Acquaviva, the fifth general of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, to its various superiors, and laying down the methods to be adopted for the increase of its power and influence. According to them, every means is to be employed of acquiring wealth for the order, by enticing promising young men to enter it and endow it with their estates; rich <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> are to be cajoled and dissuaded from remarriage; every means is to be used for the advancement of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> or other <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a> and to discredit the members of other orders, while the world is to be persuaded that the Societies animated by the purest and least interested motives: the reputation of those who quit it is to be assailed and traduced in every way.

<p>That the "Monita" are in reality what they pretend, cannot possibly be maintained. They are known to be the work of one Jerome Zahorowski, a <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Pole</a>, who, having been a member of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, had been discharged in 1611. They first appeared at Cracow in 1612 in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, purporting to be a translation from the Spanish, and were printed in the same city in 1614. Various stories were told, however, as to the mode in which these secret instructions were originally discovered; the credit being most commonly assigned to Duke Christian of Brunswick who, having been born in 1599, was a mere boy when they first saw the light. The place where they were found was variously set down as <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, Glatz, and on board a captured East Indianman. Attempts were likewise made at various times, as late even as 1783, to excite interest in the work as the result of a new discovery; to say nothing of an undated edition, in the early nineteenth century, which professes to issue from the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> Press, and to be authenticated by the testimonies of various <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> authorities. These, however, are manifestly nothing but impudent and malignant fabrications, the general, "Felix Aconiti", being utterly unknown in the Annals of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, and the censor who approves the publication bearing the ominous name "Pasquinelli", while the titles which, it is alleged, should ensure the esteem of men in general for the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, include all the crimes and abominations of every kind &#151; immoralities, conspiracies, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murders</a>, and regicides &#151; which their bitterest enemies have ever attributed to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>.

<p>In looking for more authentic evidence as to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> character of the "Monita", it is unnecessary to cite any to whose testimony a suspicion of partiality might attach &#151; from Bishop Lipski of Cracow (1616), through the long list of <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> writers who have from the first denounced the fabrication, and who are quoted by Father Bernard Duhr in his "Jesuiten Fablen". Witnesses beyond any such exception are for example, the famous <a href="../cathen/13477b.htm">Fra Paolo Sarpi</a>, the historian of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> <a href="../cathen/07219a.htm">Henri de Saint-Ignace</a>, as well as Arnauld and the "Nouvelles Ecclesiastiques", to whom may be added <a href="../cathen/11511a.htm">Pascal</a> himself, whose negative testimony is sufficient to show what he thought on the subject.

<p>To these witnesses may be added such pronounced anti-Jesuits as von Lang, <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, Friedrich (the author of Janus), Huber, and Reusch, as well as the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> historian Gieseler. In the British House of Commons, during the debates on Catholic Emancipation, the <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraudulent</a> character of the "Monita" was fully acknowledged by more than one speaker, while the authorities of the British Museum and likewise the French bibliographer M. Barbier, agree in describing the work as "apocryphal".

<p>The only defence seriously attempted on the other side is that offered by the late Dr. Littledale in his <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> article "Jesuits", in the "Encyclopaedia Britannica". He acknowledges, indeed, that the work is in reality "both caricature and libel", but pleads nevertheless that it is substantially <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, since its author, "a shrewd and keen observer", having noticed how <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> actually worked, <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> from his observations the rules by which they were guided. As to this remarkable example of "jesuiti cal" argumentation, it is sufficient to inquire upon what solid foundation Dr. Littledale's basal assumption rests. Where is the evidence that the principles of the "Monita" animate <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> practice? The official rules and constitutions of the order plainly contradict I every respect these supposed instructions, for they expressly prohibit the acceptance of <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a> by its subjects, unless compelled by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority, and from the days of the founder, St. Ignatius himself, it is known that every obstacle has been thrown by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in the way of such promotion. Moreover, in many cases, genuine private instructions from the general to subordinate superiors have fallen into hostile hands, but while in many cases they are found to give instructions directly contrary to those we have heard, it is not even alleged that in any instance they corroborate them.
