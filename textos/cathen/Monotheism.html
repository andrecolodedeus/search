<h1>Monotheism</h1>  

<p>Monotheism (from the Greek <em>monos</em> "only", and <em>theos</em> "god") is a word coined in comparatively modern times to designate <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">supreme God</a>, the Creator and Lord of the world, the eternal Spirit, All-powerful, All-wise, and All-good, the Rewarder of good and the Punisher of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the Source of our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and perfection. It is opposed to <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">Polytheism</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in more gods than one, and to <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheism</a>, which is disbelief in any deity whatsoever. In contrast with <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deism</a>, it is the recognition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> presence and activity in every part of creation. In contrast with <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of conscious freedom, distinct from the physical world. Both <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deism</a> and <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> are religious <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophies</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>.

<p>On the other hand, Monotheism, like <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">Polytheism</a>, is a term applying primarily to a concrete system of religion. The grounds of reason underlying monotheism have already been set forth in the article <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">GOD</a>. These grounds enable the inquiring mind to recognize the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> as a morally certain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Its reasonableness acquires still greater force from the positive data associated with the revelation of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">REVELATION</a>.)
<h2>Primitive monotheism</h2>

<p>Was monotheism the religion of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parents</a>? Many Evolutionists and <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalist</a> <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> answer No. Rejecting the very notion of positive, <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>, they hold that the mind of man was in the beginning but little above that of his ape-like ancestors, and hence incapable of grasping so <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> a conception as that of Monotheism.

<p>They assert that the first religious notions entertained by man in his upward course towards civilization were <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a> of the grossest kind. In a word, primitive man was, in their opinion, a savage, differing but little from existing savages in his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, moral, and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> teaches that the religion of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parents</a> was monotheistic and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, being the result of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>. Not that primitive man without Divine help could not possibly have come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first man</a>, like his descendants today, had by nature the capacity and the aptitude for religion. Being a man in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense, with the use of reason, he had the tendency then, as men have now, to recognize in the phenomena of nature the workings of a mind and a will vastly superior to his own. But, as he lacked experience and scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, it was not easy for him to unify the diverse phenomena of the visible world. Hence he was not without danger of going astray in his religious interpretation of nature. He was liable to miss the important <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that, as nature is a unity, so the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of nature is one. Revelation was morally <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parents</a>, as it is for men today, to secure the possession of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> monotheistic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and worship.

<p>The conception that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> vouchsafed such a revelation is eminently reasonable to everyone who recognizes that the end of man is to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is repugnant to think that the first generations of men were left to grope in the dark, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> alike of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a> and of their religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, while at the same time it was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will that they should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him. The instruction in religion which children receive from their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and superiors, anticipating their powers of independent reasoning, and guiding them to a right <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being impossible for our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parents</a>, was not without a fitting substitute. They were set right from the first in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of their religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> by a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>. It is a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, intimately connected with the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> and with that of the Atonement, that our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parents</a> were raised to the state of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> and were destined to a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end, namely, the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. This necessarily implies <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which could come only by revelation.

<p>Nor is there anything in sound <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> or philosophy to invalidate this teaching that Monotheistic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> was imparted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to primitive man. While it may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> in the beginning was on a comparatively low plane of material culture, it is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the first men were endowed with reason, i.e., with the ability to conceive with sufficient distinctness of a being who was the cause of the manifold phenomena presented in nature. On the other hand, a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> degree of culture along the lines of art and industry is quite compatible with right religion and morality, as is evident in the case of tribes converted to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in recent times; while retaining much of their rude and primitive mode of living, they have reached very clear notions concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and shown remarkable fidelity in the observance of His law. As to the bearing of the Evolutionistic hypothesis on this question, see <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">FETISHISM</a>.



<p>It is thus quite in accordance with the accredited results of physical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> to maintain that the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first man</a>, created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was keen of mind as well as sound of body, and that, through Divine instruction, he began life with right notions of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of his moral and religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. This does not necessarily mean that his conception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was scientifically and philosophically profound. Here it is that scholars are wide of the mark when they argue that Monotheism is a conception that implies a philosophic grasp and training of mind absolutely impossible to primitive man.

<p>The notion of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">supreme God</a> needed for religion is not the highly metaphysical conception demanded by right philosophy. If it were, but few could hope for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of religion is the unspeakably great Lord on whom man depends, in whom he recognizes the source of his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and perfection; He is the righteous Judge, rewarding good and punishing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; the loving and merciful Father, whose ear is ever open to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of His needy and penitent children. Such a conception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be readily grasped by simple, unphilosophic minds &#151; by children, by the unlettered peasant, by the converted savage.

<p>Nor are these notions of a supreme being utterly lacking even where barbarism still reigns. Bishop Le Roy, in his interesting work, "Religion des primitifs" (Paris, 1909), and Mr. A. Lang, in his "Making of Religion" (New York, 1898), have emphasized a point too often overlooked by students of religion, namely, that with all their religious crudities and <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a>, such low-grade savages as the Pygmies of the Northern Congo, the Australians, and the natives of the Andaman Islands entertain very noble conceptions of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Supreme Deity</a>. To say, then, that primitive man, fresh from the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was incapable of monotheistic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, even with the aid of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>, is contrary to well-ascertained fact. From the opening chapters of Genesis we gather that our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parents</a> recognized <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be the author of all things, their Lord and Master, the source of their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, rewarding good and punishing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The simplicity of their life made the range of their moral <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> easy of recognition. Worship was of the simplest kind.
<h2>Mosaic monotheism</h2>

<p>The ancient Hebrew religion, <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by Moses in the name of <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jehovah</a> (Jahweh), was an impressive form of Monotheism. That it was Divinely revealed is the unmistakable teaching of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, particularly of Exodus and the following books which treat explicitly of <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic legislation</a>. Even non-Catholic Scriptural scholars, who no longer accept the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, as it stands, as the literary production of Moses, recognize, in great part, that, in the older sources which, according to them, go to make up the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>, there are portions that reach back to the time of Moses, showing the existence of Hebrew monotheistic worship in his day. Now, the transcendent superiority of this Monotheism taught by Moses offers a strong <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of its Divine origin. At a time when the neighbouring nations representing the highest civilization of that time &#151; <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, Greece &#151; were giving an impure and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> worship to many <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a>, we find the insignificant Hebrew people professing a religion in which <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, impure rites, and a degrading mythology had no legitimate place, but where, instead, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">one true God</a> was associated with a dignified worship and a lofty <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> code. Those who reject the claim of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> Monotheism to have been revealed have never yet succeeded in giving a satisfactory explanation of this extraordinary phenomenon. It was, however, pre-eminently the religion of the Hebrew people, destined in the fullness of time to give place to the higher monotheistic religion revealed by Christ, in which all the nations of the earth should find peace and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. The Jewish people was thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> chosen people, not so much by reason of their own merit, as because they were destined to prepare the way for the absolute and universal religion, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Moses is no mere tribal deity. He is the Creator and Lord of the world. He gives over to His chosen people the land of the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaanites</a>. He is a jealous <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, forbidding not only worship of strange gods, but the use of images, which might lead to abuses in that age of almost universal <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Love of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is made a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, but reverential fear is the predominant emotion. The religious sanction of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is centred chiefly in temporal rewards and punishments. Laws of conduct, though determined by <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> rather than by charity and mercy, are still eminently humane.
<h2>Christian monotheism</h2>

<p>The sublime Monotheism taught by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has no parallel in the history of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is presented to us as the loving, merciful Father, not of one privileged people, but of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. In this filial relation with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> &#151; a relation of confidence, gratitude, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> &#151; Christ centres our <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> both to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to our fellow-men. He lays hold of the individual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and reveals to it its high destiny of Divine sonship. At the same time, He impresses on us the corresponding <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of treating others as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> children, and hence as our brethren, entitled not simply to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but to mercy and charity. To complete this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> fellowship, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> shows Himself to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">eternal Son of God</a>, sent by His heavenly Father to save us from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to raise us to the life of grace and to the dignity of children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through the atoning merits of His life and death. The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a> thus includes the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of His incarnate Son. Personal devotion to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the motive of right conduct in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Monotheism. Co-operating in the sanctification of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> is the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and life, sent to confirm the faithful in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and charity. These three Divine Persons, distinct from one another, equal in all things, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are one in essence, a trinity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the one, undivided <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">TRINITY</a>). Such is the Monotheism taught by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. The guaranty of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His teaching is to be found in His supreme moral excellence, in the perfection of His <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> teaching, in His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, especially His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">bodily resurrection</a>, and in His wonderful influence on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> for all time. (Cf. <a href="../bible/joh017.htm#vrs3">John 17:3</a>; <a href="../bible/1co008.htm#vrs4">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>) As <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in its beginnings was surrounded by the <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheistic</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and practices of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> world, a clear and authoritative expression of Monotheism was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Hence the symbols of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or creeds, open with the words: "I [we] <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> [<em>theon, deum</em>]" or, more explicitly, "I [we] <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> [<em>hena theon, unum deum</em>]". (See <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, "Enchiridion", 1-40; cf. <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">APOSTLES' CREED</a>; <a href="../cathen/02033b.htm">ATHANASIAN CREED</a>; <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">NICENE CREED</a>.) Among the early <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, some of the most important and most directly opposed to Monotheism arose out of the attempt to account for the origin of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Good they ascribed to one divine principle, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to another. (See <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">GNOSTICISM</a>; MANICH&AElig;ISM; <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">MARCIONITES</a>.) These <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualistic</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> gave occasion for a vigorous defence of Monotheism by such writers as St. Iren&aelig;us, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, St. Augustine, etc. (see Bardenhewer-Shahan, "Patrology", St. Louis, 1908).

<p>The same <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> naturally held the foremost place in the teaching of the missionaries who converted the races of Northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; in fact, it may be said that the diffusion of Monotheism is one of the great achievements of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the various <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> definitions regarding the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity of Persons in God</a>, emphasis is laid on the unity of the Divine nature; see, e.g., Fourth Council of Lateran (1215), in <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, "Enchiridion", 428. The <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">medieval Scholastics</a>, taking up the traditional <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, brought to its support a long array of arguments based on reason; see, for instance, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, "Contra Gentes", I, xlii; and <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>, "Monol.", iv. During the last three centuries the most conspicuous tendency outside the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has been towards such extreme positions as those of Monism and <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> in which it is asserted that all things are really one in substance, and that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is identical with the world. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, however, has steadfastly maintained, not only that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is essentially distinct from all things else, but also that there is only one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. "If any one deny the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Creator and Lord of all things visible and invisible, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>" (Conc. Vatican., Sess. III, "De fide", can. i).
<h2>Mohammedan monotheism</h2>

<p>Of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> Monotheism little need be said. The <a href="../cathen/01316a.htm">Allah</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a> is practically one with the <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Jehovah</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>. Its keynote is <a href="../cathen/08190a.htm"><em>islam</em></a>, submissive resignation to the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is expressed in everything that happens. <a href="../cathen/01316a.htm">Allah</a> is, to use the words of the <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a>, "The Almighty, the All-knowing, the All-just, the Lord of the worlds, the Author of the heavens and the earth, the Creator of life and death, in whose hand is dominion and irresistible power, the great all-powerful Lord of the glorious throne. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the mighty . . . the Swift in reckoning, who knoweth every ant's weight of good and of ill that each man hath done, and who suffereth not the reward of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to perish. He is the King, the Holy, . . . the Guardian over His servants, the Shelterer of the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a>, the Guide of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erring</a>, the Deliverer from every affliction, the Friend of the bereaved, the Consoler of the afflicted, . . . the generous Lord, the gracious Hearer, the Near-at-hand, the Compassionate, the Merciful, the Forgiving" (cited from "Islam", by Ameer Ali Syed). The influence of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, particularly the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, on <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> Monotheism is well known and need not be dwelt on here.
<h2>Monotheism and polytheistic religions</h2>

<p>What has thus far been said leads to the conclusion that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Monotheism and its antecedent forms, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> and primitive Monotheism, are independent in their origin of the <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">Polytheistic religions</a> of the world. The various forms of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a> that now flourish, or that have existed in the past, are the result of man's faulty attempts to interpret nature by the light of unaided reason. Wherever the scientific view of nature has not obtained, the mechanical, secondary causes that account for such striking phenomena as sun, moon, lightning, tempest, have invariably been viewed either as living beings, or as inert bodies kept in movement by invisible, intelligent agents. This personalizing of the striking phenomena of nature was common among the highest <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> nations of antiquity. It is the common view among peoples of inferior culture today. It is only since modern <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> has brought all these phenomena within the range of physical law that the tendency to view them as manifestations of distinct personalities has been thoroughly dispelled. Now such a personalizing of nature's forces is compatible with Monotheism so long as these different intelligences fancied to produce the phenomena are viewed as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> creatures, and hence not worthy of Divine worship. But where the light of revelation has been obscured in whole or in part, the tendency to deify these personalities associated with natural phenomena has asserted itself.

<p>In this way <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheistic</a> nature-worship seems to have arisen. It arose from the mistaken application of a sound principle, which man everywhere seems naturally to possess, namely, that the great operations of nature are due to the agency of mind and will. Professor George Fisher observes: "The <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheistic religions</a> did not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in identifying the manifold activities of nature with <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> agency. The spontaneous feelings of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> in this particular are not belied by the principles of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a> lies in the splintering of that will which is immanent in all the operations of nature into a plurality of personal agents, a throng of divinities, each active and dominant within a province of its own" ("Grounds of Christian and Theistic Belief", 1903, p. 29). <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">Polytheistic</a> nature-worship is to be found among practically all peoples who have lacked the guiding star of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>. Such history of these individual <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> as we possess offers little evidence of an upward development towards Monotheism: on the contrary, in almost every instance of known historic development, the tendency has been to degenerate further and further from the monotheistic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. There is, indeed, scarcely a <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">Polytheistic religion</a> in which one of the many <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> recognized is not held in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> as the father and lord of the rest. That this is the result of an upward development, as non-Catholic scholars very generally assert, is speculatively possible. But that it may as well be the outcome of a downward development from a primitive monotheistic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> cannot be denied. The latter view seems to have the weight of positive evidence in its favour. The ancient Chinese religion, as depicted in the oldest records, was remarkably close to pure Monotheism. The gross <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">Polytheistic</a> nature-worship of the Egyptians of later times was decidedly a degeneration from the earlier quasi-Monotheistic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/15318a.htm">Vedic</a> religion a strong Monotheistic tendency asserted itself, only to weaken later on and change into <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>. The one <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> exception is the upward development which the ancient Aryan <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">Polytheism</a> took in the land of the Iranians. Through the wise reform of Zoroaster, the various gods of nature were subordinated to the supreme, omniscient spirit, <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ormuzd</a>, and were accorded an inferior worship as his creatures. <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ormuzd</a> was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as the creator of all that is good, the revealer and guardian of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of religious and moral conduct, and the sanctifier of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. The sense of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was strongly developed, and a standard of morality was set forth that justly excites admiration. <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, the final renovation of the world, including the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">bodily resurrection</a>, were elements in <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrian</a> <a href="../cathen/05528b.htm">eschatology</a>. A nobler religion outside the sphere of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religion</a> is not to be found. Yet even this religion is rarely classed by scholars among monotheistic <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, owing to the <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheistic</a> colouring of its worship of the subordinate nature-spirits, and also to its retention of the ancient Aryan rite of fire-worship, justified by <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrians</a> of modern times as a form of symbolic worship of <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ormuzd</a>.

<p>The so-called survivals in higher <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in food-eating ghosts, pain-causing spirits, <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witchcraft</a>, the use of amulets and fetishes, are often cited as evidence that even such forms of Monotheism as <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> are but outgrowths of lower <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>. The presence of the greater part of these <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and customs in the more <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> sections of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> peoples is easily explained as the survival of tenacious customs that flourished among the ancestors of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> peoples long before their conversion to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Again, many of these <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and customs are such as might easily arise from faulty interpretations of nature, unavoidable in unscientific grades of culture, even where the monotheistic <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> prevailed. Superstitions like these are but the rank weeds and vines growing around the tree of religion.
