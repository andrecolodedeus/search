<h1>Monsignor</h1>  

<p>(<em>Dominus meus; monseigneur</em>, My Lord).

<p>As early as the fourteenth century it was the custom to address <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> high in rank or power with the title Monseigneur or Monsignore. In the intercourse of seculars, either of equals or of superiors with inferiors, there was no fixed rule. Until the seventeenth century French nobles demanded from their subjects and dependents the title of Monseigneur. In international intercourse two titles gradually won general recognition, "Monsieur" as the title of the eldest brother of the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (if not heir presumptive) and "Monseigneur" for the Dauphin, or eldest son of the French king, who was also the crown prince, or for whatever male member of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was recognized as heir presumptive to the throne. Actually all Bourbon pretenders assume this title as a matter of course, e.g. the late Don Carlos Duke of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, his son Don Jaime, the Count of <a href="../cathen/03399a.htm">Caserta</a>, the Duke of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, etc. Moreover, the custom often obtains, especially in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, of extending by courtesy the title Monseigneur to the adult members of the Bourbons and closely allied <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> usually addressed as "Your Royal Highness". In official usage, however, this would scarcely be permissible. At present the title is no longer borne by other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of civil rank, and, so far as the author of this article is aware, no one else lays claim to it. Among <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> the title Monsignore implies simply a distinction bestowed by the highest <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, either in conjunction with an office or merely titular. In any case it bears with it a certain prescribed dress. To counteract a widely spread misconception we may state here that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> does not bestow the title Monsignore, but a distinction of some sort to which this title is attached. Accordingly it is quite incorrect to say that any one has been appointed a Monsignor by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. If we may be permitted to use a comparison, Monsignor in the spiritual order corresponds to the word officer in the military. The highest general and the youngest lieutenant are equally officers, and the most venerable patriarch bears the title Monsignor as well as the simplest honorary <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>. Thus among <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, both higher and lower, it is no badge of distinction except as it denotes in a very general way an elevation above the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Those only bear the title of Monsignor, who are <em>familiares summi pontificis</em>, those who, by virtue of some distinction bestowed upon them, belong as it were to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and the retinue of the Holy Father. These familiares are entitled to be present in the <em>cappella pontificia</em> (when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> celebrates solemn Mass), and to participate in all public celebrations purely religious or <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> in character, at which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> retinue assist. it is assumed that they will appear in the robes corresponding to their respective offices.

<p>Up to 1630, when <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> reserved the title Eminence (<em>Eminentissimus</em>) for the exclusive use of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, the latter bore the title of Monsignor in common with the other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of high rank, and in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> it is still customary to address a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> as Monseigneur. In all other languages this usage has completely disappeared, so that, practically speaking, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> are no longer counted among the Monsignori. All other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, from <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> down, who have received a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> distinction or are <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or mitred <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> (among the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> only), have a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to this title. The fact that it lapsed in usage in many countries, so far as these are concerned, does not affect the question. Instead of addressing <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> as "Vostra Beatitudine", <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> as "Your Grace", <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as "My Lord", <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> as "Gracious Lord" one may without any breach of etiquette salute all equally as Monsignor. Following is a list of official and honorary <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> exclusive of those already mentioned: <ul><li>the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the seven official prothonotaries Apostolic <em>de numero participantium</em> (of the number of participants); <li>the supernumerary prothonotaries (<em>supra numerum</em>), including, (a) the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> canons of the three patriarchal <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, (b) the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> canons of certain <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral churches</a>, while in office; <li>prothonotaries Apostolic <em>ad instar participantium</em> (after the manner of participants), including, (a) <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> canons of certain <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral churches</a>, as above, (b) prothonotaries appointed <em>ad personam</em> (individually); <li>the College of Auditors of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>; <li>the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of official <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of the Apostolic Camera; <li>all other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> not members of any of the above named colleges, the numerous domestic <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> scattered throughout the world. All the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> are entitled to wear the <a href="../cathen/09611a.htm">mantelletta</a> and <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a>; <li>the private chamberlains constituting the official college of pontifical masters of ceremonies; <li>the official private chamberlains known as <em>participantes</em>; <li>the super-numerary private chamberlains (<em>camerieri segreti soprannumerari</em>), of whom there are several hundred in various parts of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world; <li>the honorary chamberlains in violet; <li>the honorary chamberlains <em>extra urbem</em> (outside the city), who are not received in their official capacity in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court when held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; <li>the official college <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>; <li>the honorary private <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>; <li>the honorary <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> <em>extra urbem</em> (see 11); <li>the private <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>; and <li>the official college of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>. </ul>

<p>In the case of certain of the above-mentioned classes the honorary office (together with the corresponding title and distinctive dress) lapses at the death of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. This is particularly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> with regard to the supernumerary private and honorary Chamberlains. The reason for this is self-evident. It is possible to be prothonotary of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy Roman Church</a> or cleric of the Apostolic Camera, etc.; but one cannot be chamberlain to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy Roman Church</a>, but simply chamberlain to a particular pontiff, whose death dissolves the relation between the two. Unless the newly elected pontiff renews the appointment the former chamberlain returns permanently to the general ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Nor is there inconsistency in the fact that certain lay chamberlains continue in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> service immediately after a papal election. Their services are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to the new pontiff and he naturally recognizes such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, which amounts practically to a tacit appointment. It is regrettable that occasionally <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> thus distinguished by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> either assume a dress arranged according to their own notions or, being dissatisfied with dress conceded, appropriate that of a higher office. The farther a country is from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the more apt are such things to occur. It should be noted that members of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders may use the title "Monsignor" only if they are <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. All other ranks of the prelacy are of course closed to them, if we except the <a href="../cathen/10039a.htm">Master of the Sacred Palace</a>, who being always a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, is one of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, but may not be addressed as Monsignor. The custom introduced in the sixteenth century of giving the generals of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders the title "Monsignor" was of short duration.
