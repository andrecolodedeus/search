<h1>Monte Vergine</h1>  

<p>An <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in the province of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, near the town of <a href="../cathen/02149c.htm">Avellino</a>, commanding a magnificent view of the Mediterranean along the Bays of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06333a.htm">Gaeta</a>, and inland as far as the Abruzzi Mountains. Monte Vergine was formerly known as Mons Sacer because of a temple sacred to Cybele that stood there; also as Mons Virgilianus, from the legend that Virgil retired thither to study the Sibylline books. <a href="../cathen/06033b.htm">St. Felix of Nola</a> is said to have taken refuge there, and in the seventh century St. Vitalian of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a> erected on the hill a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>, called "Sancta Maria de Monte Vergine". Whatever the origin of the name it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> shrine existed there, and the ruins of the temple of Cybele lie all about the hill. In 1119 <a href="../cathen/15639b.htm">St. William of Vercelli</a> built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of strict observance and perpetual abstinence on Monte Vergine, and in 1149 his successor Blessed Robert, with the approval of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, gave it to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>. According to Castellain, St. William was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 25 June. As early as 1191 the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> is spoken of as belonging "ad Dominum Papam specialiter". It received throughout the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> many marks of consideration from the kings of the Two Sicilies, within whose domains there were at one time no less than one hundred <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of this branch of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> order. After many vicissitudes, laxity of rule threatened ruin to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and in the sixteenth century Clement VIII charged Blessed John Leonard, founder of the <a href="../cathen/04051d.htm">Clerks Regular</a> of the Mother of God, to restore the monastic spirit. The new constitutions were approved by Paul V in 1611, and included among other things a regulation that the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Monte Vergine should use the <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>. The habit of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> was to be white, and they were to wear a white scapular.

<p>From the beginning the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> seems to have been freed from <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> control, and its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> had the faculty of conferring the four <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> and confirmation. Between 1440 and 1515 it was held in commendam by five cardinals, and in that year was united with the Hospital of the Nunziata at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. The governors of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> sent as their representative to Monte Vergine a <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacristan</a> who interfered with the discipline of the place, and from this indignity the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were freed by St. Pius V in 1557. In 1579 Gregory XIII gave them charge of St. Agatha's in Subura, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; Paul V made it a privileged <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and it remained in their care until Gregory XVII gave it to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> students (see IRISH COLLEGE, ROME).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> contains an ancient Byzantine picture of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>, said to have come originally from Antioch. The dark features of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> standing out from a background of bright gold have won for it from peasants and <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> the name of "Schiavona". The story runs, that the head of the picture was cut from its frame by Baldwin, the Latin Emperor of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, to save it from <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a>, that it was found among his possessions by his grand-niece Catherine of Valois (who lies buried in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>), and that she gave it to Monte Vergine. The lower portion of the picture as it exists in the shrine was added at a later date by the brush of <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a> di Arezzo. The church is also said to contain relics of the bodies of the young men, Sidrach, Misach, Abdenago, who were saved from the fiery furnace. These relics were brought from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> by <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>. Pentecost and the eighth of September are the two great days of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> and rejoicing at Monte Vergine. The nearest town is Mercogliano and on these days its population is more than doubled. The present <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> is Mgr. Victor Corvaia, O.S.B., born at <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, 19 June, 1834, succeeded 18 January, 1884. The chapter consists of 15 canons. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot's</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> extends over 7 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> forming part of four communes in the border provinces of <a href="../cathen/02149c.htm">Avellino</a> and <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>. There are 27 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> within the prelacy, and the population of 8070 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is ministered to by 31 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> and 18 regulars.
