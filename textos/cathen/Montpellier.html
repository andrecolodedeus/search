<h1>Montpellier</h1>  

<p>The Diocese of Montpellier (Montis Pessulani) comprises the department of H&eacute;rault, and is a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. When the Concordat of 1802 reestablished this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, it accorded to it also the department of Tarn, which was detached from it in 1822 by the creation of the <a href="../cathen/01267a.htm">Archdiocese of Albi</a>; and from 1802 to 1822, Montpellier was a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. A <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 16 June, 1877, authorized the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Montpellier to call themselves <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Montpellier, B&eacute;ziers, <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm#agde">Agde</a>, Lod&egrave;ve, and Saint-Pons, in memory of the different <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> united in the present Diocese of Montpellier.
<h3 id="A">Diocese of Montpellier</h3>

<p>Maguelonne was the original diocese. Local traditions, recorded in 1583 by Abb&eacute; Gariel in his "Histoire des &eacute;v&ecirc;ques de Maguelonne", affirm that St. Simon the Leper, having landed at the mouth of the Rh&ocirc;ne with St. Lazarus and his sisters, was the earliest apostle of Maguelonne. Gariel invokes in favour of this tradition a certain <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> brought from Byzantium. But the chronicler, Bishop Arnaud de Verdale (1339-1352) was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this alleged Apostolic origin of Maguelonne. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the tombstone of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> named Vera was found at Maguelonne; Le Blant assigns it to the fourth century. The first historically known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maguelonne was Boetius, who assisted at the Council of Narbonne in 589. Maguelonne was completely destroyed in the course of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> between <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was then transferred to Substantion, but Bishop Arnaud (1030-1060) brought it back to Maguelonne which he rebuilt. Near Maguelonne had grown up by degrees the two villages of Montpellier and Montpellieret. According to legend, they were in the tenth century the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the two sisters of <a href="../cathen/06313a.htm">St. Fulcran</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lod&egrave;ve. About 975 they gave them to Ricuin, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maguelonne. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that about 990 Ricuin possessed these two villages; he kept Montpellieret and gave Montpellier in fief to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Guillems. In 1085 Pierre, Count of Substantion and Melgueil, became a vassal of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for this countship, and relinquished the right of <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to the Diocese of Maguelonne. <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> charged the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maguelonne to exercise the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> suzerainty, and he spent five days in this town when he came to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to preach the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a>. In 1215 <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> gave the countship of Melgueil in fief to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maguelonne, who thus became a temporal lord.

<p>From that time the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maguelonne had the right of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a>. <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a> reproached (1266) Bishop B&eacute;renger de Fr&eacute;dol with causing to be struck in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> a coin called "Miliarensis", on which was rend the name of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mahomet</a>; in fact at that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as well as the King of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> and the Count of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, authorized the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a> of Arabic money, not intended for circulation in Maguelonne, but to be sold for exportation to the merchants of the Mediterranean.

<p>In July, 1204, Montpellier passed into the hands of Peter of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, son-in-law of the last of the Guillems; Jaime I, son of Peter II, united the city to the Kingdom of Majorca. In 1282 the King of Majorca paid homage to the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for Maguelonne. B&eacute;renger de Fr&eacute;dol, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maguelonne, ceded Montpellier to <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip IV</a> (1292). Jaime III of Majorca sold Montpellier to Philip VI (1349); and the city, save for the period from 1365 to 1382, was henceforth French. <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a> (Guillaume de Grimoard) had studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and canon law at Montpellier and was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by Cardinal Ardouin Aubert, nephew of <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maguelonne from 1352 to 1354; hence the attachment of <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Pope Urban</a> for this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> which he favoured greatly. In 1364 he caused the foundation at Montpellier, of a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> under the patronage of St. Germain, and came himself to Montpellier to see the new church (9 Jan.-8 March, 1367). He caused the city to be surrounded by ramparts, in order that the scholars might work there in safety; and finally he caused a large canal to be begun by which Montpellier might communicate with the sea. At the request of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">King Francis I</a>, who pleaded the epidemics and the ravages of the pirates which constantly threatened Maguelonne, <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> transferred the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to Montpellier (27 March, 1536). Montpellier, into which <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> was introduced in Feb., 1560, by the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, Guillaume Mauget, was much troubled by the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of religion. Under Henry III a sort of <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> republic was installed there. The city was reconquered by Louis XIII (October, 1622).



<p>Among the 54 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Maguelonne, and the 18 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Montpellier, may be mentioned: Blessed Louis Aleman (1418-23), later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles; <a href="../cathen/11609c.htm">Guillaume Pellicier</a> (1527-68), whom <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> sent as an ambassador to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and whose leaning as a <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> and naturalist made him after Sc&eacute;vole de Sainte-Marthe, "the most learned man of his century"; the preacher Pierre Fenouillet (1608-52); Fran&ccedil;ois de Bosquet (1657-76), whose historical labours were very useful to the celebrated <a href="../cathen/02242a.htm">Baluze</a>; the bibliophile Colbert de Croissy (1696-1738), who induced the Oratorian Pouget to compose in 1702 the famous "Catechism of Montpellier", condemned by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in 1712 and 1721 for <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> tendencies; Fournier (1806-34), who in 1801 was confined for a time in the madhouse at Bic&ecirc;tre at the command of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, for a sermon against the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. Among the numerous councils and <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> held at Montpellier, the following merit mention: the council of 1162 in which <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, Victor; the provincial synod of 1195, which was occupied with the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>; the council of 1215, which was presided over by Peter of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and passed important canons concerning discipline, and declared also that subject to the approval of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and all the other towns taken from the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> should be given to Simon de Montfort; the council of 1224, which rejected the request of Raymond, Count of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. who promised to protect the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and demanded that Amaury de Montfort withdraw his claims to the countship of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>; the council of 1258, which by permitting the seneschal of Beaucaire to arrest <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> taken in the act of crime, in order to hand them over to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, made way for royal magistrates to exercise a certain power within the limits of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> and thus inaugurated the movement as a result of which, under the name of "privileged cases", a certain number of offences committed by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> became amenable to lay <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<h3 id="agde">Diocese of Agde</h3>

<p>Local traditions designate as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm#agde">Agde</a>, St. Venustus, said to have suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> during the legendary invasion of the barbarian, Chrocus, about 407 or 408. The first historically known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm#agde">Agde</a> is Sophronius who assisted at the <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Council of Agde</a> in 506.
<h3 id="C">Diocese of B&eacute;ziers</h3>

<p>Local traditions assign as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of B&eacute;ziers the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> saint, Aphrodisius, said to have sheltered the Holy Family at Hermopolis and to have become a disciple of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, also to have accompanied Sergius Paulus to Gaul when the latter went thither to found the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Narbonne, and to have died a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> at B&eacute;ziers. The first historically known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Paulinus mentioned in 418; St. Guiraud was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of B&eacute;ziers from 1121 to 1123; <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> refused the See of B&eacute;ziers to devote himself to the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses.</a>

<p>Among the fifteen <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> held at B&eacute;ziers must be mentioned that of 356 held by Saturninus of Arles, <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, against St. Hilary; those of 1233, 1246 and 1255 against the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>.

<p>Local traditions made St. Aphrodisius arrive at B&eacute;ziers mounted on a camel. Hence the custom of leading a camel in the procession at B&eacute;ziers on the feast of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>; this lasted until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>.
<h3 id="D">Diocese of Lod&egrave;ve</h3>

<p>Since the fourteenth century local tradition has made St. Florus first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Lod&egrave;ve, and relates that as a disciple of St. Peter, he afterwards evangelized Haute-Auvergne and died in the present village of St-Flour. It is historically certain that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Lod&egrave;ve have existed since 421; the first historically known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Maternus, who was present at the <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Council of Agde</a> in 506. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Lod&egrave;ve are: St. George (863-884), previously a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>; <a href="../cathen/06313a.htm">St. Fulcran</a> (949-1006), who in 975 dedicated the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Gen&egrave;s and founded the Abbey of St. Sauveur; the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Bernard Guidonis (1324-1331); Cardinal Guillaume d'Estouteville (1450-1453), who played an important part as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, also in the rehabilitation of <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a>; the brothers Guillaume Bri&ccedil;onnet (1489-1516) and Denis Bri&ccedil;onnet (1516-1520).
<h3 id="E">Diocese of Saint-Pons-de-Thomi&egrave;res</h3>

<p>The Abbey of St-Pons was founded in 936 by Raymond, Count of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, who brought thither the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of St. G&eacute;raud d'Aurillac. By a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 18 Feb., 1318, <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> raised the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> to a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>.

<p>Special <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is paid in the present Diocese of Montpellier to St. Pons (Pontius) de Cimiez, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> under <a href="../cathen/15256b.htm">Valerian</a>, patron of St-Pons-de-Thomi&egrave;res; Sts.

The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Aniane (see <a href="../cathen/02467a.htm">B<font size=-2>ENEDICT OF</font> A<font size=-2>NIANE</font></a>) was in the ninth century a centre of monastic reform. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Valmagne was founded in 1138 by Raymond of Trencavel, Viscount of B&eacute;ziers. As early as 1180 the Hospital of the Holy Ghost at Montpellier received exposed or abandoned children.

Congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> native to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: The Augustinian Sisters of Charity of Our Lady, hospitallers, founded at B&eacute;ziers in 1646; Sisters of Christian Doctrine, founded in 1853 (mother-house at Ceilhes); <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> religious founded in 1855 (mother-house at Cette); the Nursing Sisters of Notre Dame auxiliatrice, founded 1845 by the Abb&eacute; Soulas (mother-house at Montpellier). At the beginning of the twentieth century the congregations directed in the diocese 2 cr&egrave;ches, 53 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the blind, 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for deaf mutes, 8 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for boys, 15 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for girls, 1 institution of preservation,1 establishment for correction, 1 institution of rehabilitation, 8 houses of mercy, 15 establishments for nursing the sick in their homes, 1 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for the insane, 6 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or infirmaries. In 1908 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> numbered 482,779 inhabitants, 43 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 310 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 27 vicariates.

<h2 id="university">University of Montpellier</h2>

<p>It is not known exactly at what date the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of literature were founded which developed into the Montpellier <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">faculty of arts</a>. it may be that they were a direct continuation of the Gallo-Roman <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of law was founded by Placentinus, a doctor from Bologna, who came to Montpellier in 1160, taught there during two different periods, and died there in 1192. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of medicine was founded perhaps by a graduate of the Spanish medical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that, as early as 1137, there were excellent physicians at Montpellier. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> given in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, which were completed in 1240 by Pierre de Conques, placed this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maguelonne. <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> issued a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> in 1289, combining all the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> into a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, which was placed under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but which in fact enjoyed a large measure of autonomy. Theology was at first taught in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/01556a.htm">St. Anthony of Padua</a>, Raymond Lullus, and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Bernard de la Treille lectured. Two letters of King John prove that a faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> existed at Montpellier independently of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, in January, 1350. By a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 17 December, 1421, <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> granted <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> to this faculty and united it closely with the faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>.

<p>In the sixteenth century the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> disappeared for a time, when <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>, in the reign of Henry II, held complete possession of the city. It resumed its functions after Louis XIII had reestablished the royal power at Montpellier in 1622; but the rivalries of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> interfered seriously with the prosperity of the faculty, which disappeared at the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. The faculty numbered among its illustrious pupils of law <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a>, who spent four years at Montpellier, and among its lecturers <a href="../cathen/11089a.htm">Guillaume de Nogaret</a> chancellor to <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>, Guillaume de Grimoard, afterwards <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Pedro de Luna</a>, <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> as <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>. But after the fifteenth century this faculty fell into decay, as did also the <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">faculty of arts</a>, although for a time, under Henry IV, the latter faculty had among its lecturers Casaubon. The Montpellier <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of medicine owed its success to the ruling of the Guilhems, lords of the town, by which any licensed physician might lecture there; there was no fixed limit to the number of teachers, lectures were multiplied, and there was a great wealth of teaching. Rabelais took his medical degrees at Montpellier. It was in this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> that the biological theory of vitalism, elaborated by Barthez (1734-1806), had its origin. The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> did not interrupt the existence of the faculty of medicine. The faculties of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and of letters were re-established in 1810; that of law in 1880. It was on the occasion of the sixteenth centenary of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, celebrated in 1889, that the Government of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> announced its intention &#151; which has since been realized &#151; of reorganizing the provincial <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.
