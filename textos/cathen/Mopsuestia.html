<h1>Mopsuestia</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> of Cilicia Secunda in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> and suffragan of <a href="../cathen/01461a.htm">Anazarbus</a>. The founding of this city is attributed to the soothsayer, Mopsus, who lived before the Trojan <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, although it is scarcely mentioned before the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era. Pliny calls it the free city of Mopsos (Hist. nat., V, 22), but the ordinary name is Mopsuestia or better Mompsuestia, as found in all the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> geographers and chroniclers. At one time the city took the name of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a>, but gave it up at the time of the Roman conquest; under Hadrian it was called Hadriana, under <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a> Decia, etc., as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from the inscriptions and the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of the city. Constantius built there a magnificent bridge over the Pyramus (<a href="../cathen/08466c.htm">Malalas</a>, "Chronographia", XIII; P.G., XCVII, 488) afterwards restored by Justinian (Procopius, "De Edificiis", V. 5) and still to be seen in a very bad state of preservation. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> seems to have been introduced very early into Mopsuestia and during the third century there is mention of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Theodorus, the adversary of <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>. Worthy of mention are Saint Auxentius, who lived in the fourth century and whose <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept on 18 December, and Theodore, the teacher of Nestorius. The Greek diocese which depended on the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, still existed at the beginning of the fourteenth century (<a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> "Oriens Christianus", II, 1002). At first a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/01461a.htm">Anazarbus</a>, Mopsuestia was an autocephalous <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> in 879 (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Concil. Collectio", XVII, XVIII, 472, 476-480, etc.), and perhaps it was already so in 713 (<a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, Il, 1000). The city was taken by the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> at the very beginning of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islamism</a>; in 686 we find all the surrounding forts occupied by them and in 700 they fortified the city itself (<a href="../cathen/14623a.htm">Theophanes</a>, "Chronogr.", A. M. 6178, 6193). Nevertheless because of its position on the frontier, the city fell naturally from time to time into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>, about 772 its inhabitants killed a great member of <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> (op. cit., A. M. 6264). Being besieged in vain by the Byzantine troops of John Tzimisces in 964, Mopsuestia was taken the following year after a long and difficult siege by Nicephorus Phocas. The city then numbered 200,000 inhabitants, some of whom were killed, some transported elsewhere and replaced by a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> population. Its river, the Pyramus, formed a great harbour extending twelve miles to the sea.

<p>In 1097 the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> took possession of the city and engaged in a fratricidal <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> under its walls; it remained in the possession of Tancred who annexed it to the Principality of Antioch. It suffered much from <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, and Greeks who lost it and recaptured it alternately notably in 1106, in 1152, and in 1171. The Greeks finally abandoned it to the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>. Set on fire in 1266, Mamissa, as it was called in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, became two years afterwards the capital of the Kingdom of Lesser <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, at the time that a council was held there. Although it was by this time in a state of decline it still possessed at least four <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> churches. In 1322, the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> suffered a great defeat under its walls, in 1432 the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchman</a>, Bertrandon, found the city occupied by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> and largely destroyed. Since then it has steadily declined and today, under the name of Missis, is a little village of about 800 inhabitants, partly <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, partly <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>; it is situated in the sanjak and the vilayet of <a href="../cathen/01135f.htm">Adana</a>. The list of its <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> may be found in <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, III, 1197-200; in <a href="../cathen/05181b.htm">Ducange</a>, Les families d'outre-mer", 770; in Eubel. "Hierarchia catholica medii aevi", I, 338; that of the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in Alishan, "Sissouan", 290.
