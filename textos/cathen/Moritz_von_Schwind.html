<h1>Moritz von Schwind</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1804; died at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1871. A <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> possessing an inexhaustible wealth of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, specially gifted for incisive individualization, and perfectly familiar with the entire range of tones and the power of expression by mien, movement, pose, and costume, he was one of the ornaments of the <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of art. He was above all a draughtsman and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> of small details, understanding how to make small pictures harmonious both in colour and composition. He was by nature inclined to the Romantic school of thought and feeling and this tendency, much developed in the studio of Ludwig Schnorr von Caroldfeld, was still more so by his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. After a journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of frescoes at Carlsruhe, and a short stay at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, he came in 1847 to <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> where <a href="../cathen/04376a.htm">Cornelius</a> gained great influence over him. The spirit of his art is that of the minnesingers, of <a href="../cathen/05363b.htm">Eichendorff</a>, and of Bretano. The material upon which he worked was nature and life, especially child-life, lyrically and poetically conceived, drawing and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in water-colours being the mediums in which he best expressed his thoughts. Among his fellow artists Richter and <a href="../cathen/14285a.htm">Steinle</a> stand probably in the closest relation to him. He set a high value on <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">religious painting</a>, and though he thought it less suited to his talents, he did not neglect it altogether. In the castle on the Wartburg he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> fine frescoes of the works of mercy and the life of St. Elizabeth, which recall the early <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>; he also <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> there the history of the Thuringian rulers and the <em>S&auml;ngerkrieg</em>. The work for the altar of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Our Lady at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> is splendid in tone and the coloured cartoons for <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> windows which were executed at Oxford and <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> are also greatly esteemed. At Carlsruhe he adorned the academy of art with entertaining frescoes characterizing art. The easel-picture "Ritter Kurts's Search for a Wife" had gained the commission for him, for the delightful humor of his popular creations is not spoiled by flippancy. Other excellent easel pictures are in the Schack gallery at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. In his oil-paintings, however, the harmonious combination of the parts with the whole and of the colour with the drawing are often lacking. In the frescoes the professional water-colour <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> is evident. As a water-colour <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> he attained his greatest triumphs in the cyclus of the Seven Ravens, and in that of the legend of Melusine.
