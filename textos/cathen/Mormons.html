<h1>Mormons</h1>  

<p>(<em>Also called the</em> Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.)

<p>This <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious body</a> had its origin during the early part of the nineteenth century.

<p>Joseph Smith, the founder and first president of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, was the son of a <a href="../cathen/15354b.htm">Vermont</a> farmer, and was born in Sharon township, Windsor County, in that state, on 23 December, 1805. In the spring of 1820, while living with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> at <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, <a href="../cathen/11254a.htm">Ontario</a> (now Wayne) County, <a href="../cathen/11029a.htm">New York</a>, he became deeply concerned upon the subject of his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, a condition partly induced by a religious revival which proselytized a few of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian Faith</a>. Joseph himself was inclined toward <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodism</a>; to satisfy his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> as to which one of the existing <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> he should join, he sought Divine guidance, and claimed to have received in answer to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> a visitation from two glorious beings, who told him not to connect himself to any of these Churches, but to bide the coming of Church of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which was about to be re-established.

<p>According to his own statement, there appeared to him on the night of 21 September, 1823, a heavenly messenger, who gave his name as Moroni, and revealed the existence of an ancient record containing the fullness of the Gospel of Christ as taught by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> after his <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> to the Nephites, a branch of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">House of Israel</a> which inhabited the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">American continent</a> ages prior to its discovery by <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a>. Moroni in mortal life had been a Nephite <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, the son of another <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> named Mormon, who was the compiler of the record buried in a hill situated about two miles from the modern village of Manchester.

<p>Joseph Smith states that he received the record from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Moroni in September, 1827. It was, he alleges, engraved upon metallic plates having the appearance of gold and each a little thinner than ordinary tin, the whole forming a book about six inches long, six inches wide, and six inches thick, bound together by rings. The characters engraved upon the plates were in a language styled the Reformed <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, and with the book were interpreters &#151; <a href="../cathen/15224a.htm">Urim and Thummim</a> &#151; by means of which these characters were to be translated into English. The result was the "Book of Mormon", published at <a href="../cathen/11433a.htm">Palmyra</a>, New York in March, 1830; in the preface eleven witnesses, exclusive of Joseph Smith, the translator, claim to have seen the plates from which it was taken. By renouncing Mormonism subsequently, Cowdery, Whitmer, and Harris&mdash;the three principal <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnesses</a>&mdash;implicitly declared this testimony <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. 

<p>The "Book of Mormon" purports to be an abridged account of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> dealings with the two great races of prehistoric Americans &#151; the Jaredites, who were led from the <a href="../cathen/15005b.htm">Tower of Babel</a> at the time of the confusion of the tongues, and the Nephites who came from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> just prior to the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> captivity (600 B.C.). According to this book, America is the "Land of Zion", where the New Jerusalem will be built by a gathering of scattered <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> before the second coming of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a>. The labours of such men as <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a>, the Pilgrim Fathers, and the patriots of the Revolution, are pointed out as preparatory to that consummation. The work of Joseph Smith is also prophetically indicated, he being represented as a lineal descendant of the Joseph of old, commissioned to begin the gathering of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> foretold by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaias</a> (<a href="../bible/isa011.htm#vrs10">11:10-16</a>) and other ancient <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.

<p>In another part of his narrative Joseph Smith affirms that, while translating the "Book of Mormon", he and his scribe, Oliver Cowdery, were visited by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, who declared himself to be <a href="../cathen/08406b.htm">John the Baptist</a> and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> them to the Aaronic <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; and that subsequently they were <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, <a href="../cathen/08279b.htm">James</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>. According to Smith and Cowdery, the Aaronic <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> gave them authority to preach <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and repentance, to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> by immersion for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and to administer the sacrament of the Lord's Supper; the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a> empowered them to lay on hands and bestow the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

<p>The "Book of Mormon" being published, its peculiar doctrines, including those just set forth, were preached in western New York and northern <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. Those who accepted them were termed "Mormons", but they called themselves "Latter-Day Saints", in contradistinction to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of former times. The "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints" was organized on 6 April, 1830, at Fayette, Seneca County, New York; Joseph Smith was accepted as first elder, and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, seer, and revelator.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> formulated by him are as follows:<blockquote><p>"(1) We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. <br>"(2) We believe that men will be punished for their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and not for <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">Adam's transgression</a>. <br>"(3) We believe that through the <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atonement of Christ</a> all men may be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>, by obedience to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and ordinances of the Gospel. <br>"(4) We believe that these ordinances are: First, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>; second, repentance; third, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by immersion for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; fourth, <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> for the gift of the Holy Ghost <br>"(5) We believe that a man must be called of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by prophecy, and by the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> by those who are in authority, to preach the Gospel and administer the ordinances thereof. <br>"(6) We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the same organization that existed in the <a href="../cathen/07326a.htm">primitive church</a>, viz. apostles, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> teachers, evangelists, etc. <br>"(7) We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, etc. <br>"(8) We believe the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> to be the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the 'Book of Mormon' to be the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <br>"(9) We believe all that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that he will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>. <br>"(10) We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the literal gathering of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes. That Zion will be built upon this continent. That Christ will reign personally upon the earth, and that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisaic glory. <br>"(11) We claim the privilege of worshipping <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> according to the dictates of our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and allow all men the same privilege; let them worship how, where, or what they may. <br>"(12) We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in being subject to kings, president, rulers and magistrates, in obeying. honouring and sustaining that law. <br>"(13) We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in being honest, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul, 'We believe all things, we hope all things' we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely or of good report, or praiseworthy, we seek after these things." </p></blockquote>



<p>Six months after its inception, the Mormon Church sent its first mission to the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">American Indians</a> &#151; called in the "Book of Mormon" the <em>Lamanites</em>, "the degenerate remnants of the Nephite nation." Oliver Cowdery was placed at the head of this mission, which also included Parley P. Pratt, a former preacher of the Reformed <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a>, or Campbellites. The missionaries proceeded to northern <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, then almost a wilderness, where Elder Pratt presented to his former <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, Sidney Rigdon, a copy of the "Book of Mormon", published several months before. Up to that time Rigdon had never seen the book, which he was accused of helping Smith to write. The Mormons are equally emphatic in their denial of the identity of the "Book of Mormon" with Spaulding's "Manuscript Story", now in Oberlin College; they quote in this connection James H. Fairchild that institution, who, in a communication to the "New York Observer" (5 February, 1885), states that Mr. L.L., Rice and he, after comparing the "Book of Mormon" and the Spaulding romance, "could detect no resemblance between the two, in general or detail".

<p>Elder Cowdery and his companions, after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> about one hundred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> went to western <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, and, thence crossing over at Independence into what is now the <a href="../cathen/08597a.htm">State of Kansas</a>, laboured for a time among the Indians there. Meanwhile the Mormons of the East, to escape the opposition awakened by their extraordinary claims, and to be nearer their proposed ultimate destination, moved their headquarters to Kirtland, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, from which place, in the summer of 1831, departed its first colony into <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a> &#151; Jackson County in that state having been designated as the site of the New Jerusalem.

<p>Both at Kirtland and at Independence efforts were made to establish "The United Order", a communal system of an industrial character, designed to make the church members equal in things spiritual and temporal. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> taught that a system had sanctified the City of Enoch, whose people were called "Zion, because they were of one heart and one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and dwelt in righteousness," with "no poor among them". He also declared that the ancient Apostles had endeavoured to establish such an order at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs32">Acts 4:32-37</a>), and that, according to the "Book of Mormon", it had prevailed among the Nephites for two centuries after Christ.

<p>In the latter part of 1833 trouble arose between the Mormons and the <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missourians</a>, based largely, say Mormon writers, upon a feeling of apprehension concerning the aims and motives of the new settlers. Coming from the north and the east, they were suspected of being abolitionists, which was sufficient of itself to make them unpopular in <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>. It was also charged that they intended to unite with the Indians and drive the older settlers from the land. The Mormons asserted their innocence of these and other charges, but their denial did not avail. Armed mobs came upon them, and the whole colony &#151; twelve hundred men, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and children &#151; were driven from Jackson County, and forbidden on pain of death to return.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> the Mormons prospered, though even there they had their vicissitudes. At Kirtland a temple was built, and a more complete organization of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> effected. Mormonism's first foreign mission was opened in the summer of 1837, when Heber C. Kimball and Orson Hyde, two of the "twelve apostles of the Church", were sent with other elders to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> for that purpose. While this work of proselytizing was in progress, disaffection was rife at Kirtland, and the ill-feeling grew and intensified until the "prophet" was compelled to flee for his life. It is of importance to bear in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> that the opposition to the Mormons in the localities where they settled is, from the contradictory and divergent statements made by the Latter-Day Saints and the neighbours not of their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, difficult of explanation. It is safe to assume that there was provocation on both sides. The main body of the Mormons, following their leader to <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, settled in and around Far West, Caldwell County, which now became the chief gathering place. The <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> had been organized by six men, and a year later was said to number about two thousand <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. In <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a> it increased to twelve thousand. A brief season of peace was followed by a series of calamities, occasioned by religious and political differences. The trouble began in August, 1838, and during the strife considerable blood was shed and much <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> destroyed, the final act in the drama being the mid-winter expulsion of the entire Mormon community from the state.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, where they were kindly received, they built around the small village of Commerce, in Hancock County, the city of Nauvoo, gathering in that vicinity to the number of twenty thousand. Another temple was erected, several towns founded, and the surrounding country occupied. Up to this time there had been no Mormon recruiting from abroad, all the converts to the new <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> coming from various states in the Union and from <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. In 1840-1 Brigham Young and other emissaries visited Great Britain, preaching in all the principal cities and towns. Here they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> a number of people, published a new edition of the "Book of Mormon", founded a periodical called the "Millennial Star", and established a permanent emigration agency. The first Mormon emigrants from a foreign land &#151; a small company of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> converts &#151; reached Nauvoo. by way of New York, in the summer of 1840. Subsequently the emigration came via <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>.

<p>The Legislature of <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a> granted a liberal charter to Nauvoo, and, as a protection against mob <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and further drivings and spoliations, the Mormons were permitted to organize the "Nauvoo Legion", an all but independent military body, though part of the state militia, commanded by Joseph Smith as lieutenant-general. Moreover, a municipal court was instituted, having <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in civil cases, as a bar to legal proceedings of a persecuting or vexatious character.

<p>Similar causes to those which had resulted in the exodus of the Mormons from <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a> brought about their expulsion from <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, prior to which a tragic event robbed them of their <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, Joseph Smith, and their patriarch, Hyrum Smith, who were killed by a mob in Carthage jail on 27 June, 1844. The immediate cause of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of the two brothers was the destruction of the press of the Nauvoo <em>Expositor</em>, a paper established by seceders from Mormonism to give voice to the wide indignation caused by the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of Smith's revelation of 12 July, 1843, establishing <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a>, which had been practised personally by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> for several years. Another avowed purpose of this paper was to secure the repeal of the Nauvoo Charter, which the Mormons looked upon as the bulwark of their liberties. The "Expositor" issued but once, when it was condemned as a public nuisance by order of the city council, its printing-office being destroyed and its editor, Foster, expelled. This summary act of anti-Mormon sentiment, and, on Smith's preparing to resist by force the warrant procured by foster for his arrest, the militia were called out and armed mobs began to threaten Nauvoo.

<p>At Carthage was a large body of militia, mustered under Governor Thomas Ford to compel the surrender of Nauvoo. Smith submitted and repaired to <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, where he and his brother Hyrum, with others, were placed in jail. Fearful of a bloody collision, the governor disbanded most of his force, and with the remainder marched to Nauvoo, where the Mormons laid down their arms. During the governor's absence, a portion of the disbanded militia returned to Carthage and assaulted the jail in which the Mormon leaders were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, shooting Joseph and Hyrum Smith, and all but fatally wounding John Taylor; Willard Richards, their fellow-prisoner, escaped unhurt.

<p>In the exodus that ensued, Brigham Young led the people westward. Passing over the frozen Mississippi (February, 1846), the main body made their way across the prairies of <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, reaching the Missouri River about the middle of June. A Mormon colony, sailing from New York, rounded Cape Horn, and landed at Yerba Buena (San Francisco) in July, 1846. Prior to that time only a few thousand Americans had settled on the Pacific Coast, mostly in <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, which was then claimed both by Great Britain and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. So far as known, no American had then made a permanent home in what was called "The Great Basin". The <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> region, now known as Salt Lake Valley, was then a part of the Mexican province of <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, but was uninhabited save by Indians and a few wandering trappers and hunters.

<p>The Mormon pioneers, marching from the Missouri River in April, 1847, arrived in Salt Lake Valley on 24 July. This company, numbering 143 men, 3 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and 2 children, was led by Brigham Young. Most of the exiles from Nauvoo remained in temporary shelters on the frontier where they entered into winter quarters in what is now Nebraska. Well-armed and disciplined, they accomplished the journey of over a thousand miles to Salt Lake Valley without one fatality. A few days after their arrival they laid out <a href="../cathen/13404c.htm">Salt Lake City</a>.

<p>The people left upon the Missouri migrated in the autumn of 1848, and after them came yearly to the Rocky Mountains, generally in Church wagons sent to the frontier to meet them, Mormon emigrants from the States, from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and from other lands to which missionaries continued to be sent. Most of the converts were drawn from the middle and <a href="../cathen/08719a.htm">working</a> classes, but some professional people were among them.

<p>While awaiting the time for the establishment of a civic government, the Mormons were under <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rule. Secular officers were appointed, however, to preserve the peace, administer <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and carry on public improvements. These officers were often selected at church meetings, and civil and religious functions were frequently united in the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. But this state of affairs did not continue long. As soon as a civic government was organized, many of the forms of political procedure already in use in American commonwealths were introduced, and remained in force till statehood was secured for <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a>.

<p>In March, 1849 thirteen months after the signing of the treaty by which Mexico ceded this region to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, the settlers in Salt Lake Valley founded the provisional Government of the State of Deseret, pending action by the American Congress upon their petition for admission into the Union. Deseret is a word taken from the "Book of Mormon", and signifies honey-bee. Brigham Young was elected governor, and a legislature, with a full set of executive officers, was also chosen. Congress denied the petition for statehood, and organized the Territory of <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a>, naming it after a local tribe of Indians. Brigham Young was appointed governor by President Millard Fillmore (September 1850) and four years later was reappointed by President Franklin Pierce. The period between 1850 and 1858, during which the Mormons defied the authority of the Federal Government, is one of the least creditable chapters of their history.

<p>One reason given for the persistent hostility to the Mormons was the dislike caused by the acrimonious controversy over <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a> or plural marriage. Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism, claimed to have received a revelation and a command ordering him to re-introduce plural marriage and restore the polygamous condition tolerated among the pre-Judaic tribes. Polygamy now became a principle of the creed of the Latter-Day Saints, and, though not enforced by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Mormon <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, was preached by the elders and practised by the chiefs of the cult and by many of the people. The violation by the Mormons of the monogamous law of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was brought to the attention of Congress, which prohibited under penalty of fine and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> the perpetuation of the anti-Christian practice, refusing, however, to make the prohibition retroactive. The Mormons appealed to the Supreme Court, which sustained the action of Congress, and established the constitutionality of the anti-polygamy <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>.

<p>The Latter-Day Saints, strangely enough, submitted to the decrees of Congress, unwittingly admitting by their submission that the revelation of their founder and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, Joseph Smith, could not have come from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If the command to restore <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a> to the modern world was from on High, then, by submitting to the decision of the Supreme Court, the Mormon <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> reversed the apostolic proclamation and acknowledged it was better "to obey man than to obey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>".

<p>So long as <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a> remained a territory there was much bitterness between her Mormon and non-Mormon citizens, the latter termed "Gentiles". The Mormons submitted, however, and their president, Wilford Woodruff, issued a "Manifesto" which, being accepted by the Latter-Day Saints in General Conference, withdrew the sanction of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from the further solemnization of any marriages forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the land. One of the results of this action was the admission of <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a> into the Union of States on 6 January, 1896.

<p>Instances of the violation of the anti-polygamy <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> subsequent to the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the "Manifesto" having been brought to light, the present head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (1913), President Joseph F. Smith, in April, 1904, made the following statement to the General Conference assembled at <a href="../cathen/13404c.htm">Salt Lake City</a>, and it was endorsed by resolution and adopted by unanimous vote:<blockquote>

<p align=center>OFFICIAL STATEMENT</p>

<p>Inasmuch as there are numerous reports in circulation, that plural marriages have been entered into, contrary to the official declaration of President Woodruff, of September 24th, 1890, commonly called the 'Manifesto', which was issued by President Woodruff and adopted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at its General Conference October 6th 1890, which forbade any marriages violative of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the land; I, Joseph F. Smith, President of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, hereby affirm and declare that no such marriages have been solemnized with the sanction, consent or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints; and I hereby announce that all such marriages are prohibited, and if any officer or member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> shall assume to solemnize or enter into any such marriage, he will be deemed in transgression against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> he will be liable to be dealt with according to the rules and regulations thereof, and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> therefrom.

<p>Joseph F. Smith, <br>President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Saints. </p></blockquote>

<p>In an "Address to the World", adopted at the General Conference of April, 1907, President Smith and his counsellors, John R. Winder and Anthon H. Lund, in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, reaffirmed its attitude of obedience to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of Congress. The practice of plural marriage is indeed fast becoming a thing of the past.

<p>Mormonism announces as one of its principal aims the preparation of a people for the coming of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>; a people who will build the New Jerusalem, and there await His coming. The United Order, the means of preparation, is at present in abeyance, but the preliminary work of gathering <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> goes on, not to Zion proper (Jackson County, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>) but to the Stakes of Zion, now numbering sixty-one, most of them in <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a>; the others are in <a href="../cathen/07627a.htm">Idaho</a>, <a href="../cathen/01719a.htm">Arizona</a>, <a href="../cathen/15724b.htm">Wyoming</a>, <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a>, <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and Mexico. A stake is a division of the Mormon Church, organized in such a way as to constitute almost a "church" in itself; in each stake are subdivisions called wards, also fully organized. The area of a stake is usually that of a county, though the extent of territory differs according to population or other conditions. Each stake is presided over by three high-priests, who, with twelve high councilors, constitute a tribunal for the adjudication of differences among church members within their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Each ward has a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of three, a lower tribunal, from whose decisions appeals may be taken to the high council. The extreme penalty inflicted by the church courts is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. In each stake are quorums of high-priests, seventies, and elders, officers and callings in the <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>: and in each ward, quorums of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, teachers, and deacons, who officiate in the Aaronic <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. This lesser authority <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> in temporal things, while the higher <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> in things spiritual, which include the temporal.

<p>Presiding over the entire Church is a supreme council of three high-priests, called the First Presidency, otherwise known as the president and his counsellors. Next to these are the twelve apostles, equal in authority to the First Presidency, though subject to and acting under their direction. Whenever the First Presidency is dissolved, which occurs at the death of the president, the apostles take the government and reorganize the supreme council &#151; always, however, with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whose members are called to vote for or against this or any other proposition submitted to them. The manner of voting is with the uplifted right hand, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> voting as well as men. Besides the general conference held semi-annually and the usual <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> meetings, there are stake and ward conferences, in which the consent of the people is obtained before any important action is taken. The special function of the apostles is to preach the Gospel, or have it preached, in all nations, and to set in order, whenever <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, the affairs of the entire Mormon Church.

<p>Among the general authorities there is also a presiding patriarch, who, with his subordinates in the various stakes, gives <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> to the people and comforts them with sacred ministrations. The first council of the Seventies, seventy in number, assist the twelve apostles, and preside over all the quorums of seventies. Upon a presiding <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of three devolves the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of receiving and disbursing the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and otherwise managing its business, under the general direction of the first presidency.

<p>The Mormon Church is supported by the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> and offerings of its members, most of whom reside in the Stakes of Zion, though a good number remain in the several missions, scattered in various countries of the globe. About two thousand missionaries are kept in the field; while they consider themselves under the Divine injunction to "preach the Gospel to every creature", they have special instructions to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> no married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> without the consent of her husband, and no child under age without the consent of its <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> are used for the building of <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> and other places of worship, the work of the ministry, the furtherance of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and indigent, and for charitable and philanthropic purposes in general. Nearly every male member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> holds some office in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, but only those who devote their entire time to its service receive support.

<p>In every stake are institutions known as auxiliaries, such as relief <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, young men's and young ladies' mutual improvement associations, primary associations, and religious classes. The Relief Society is a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> organization, having a special mission for the relief of the destitute and the care of the sick. An "Old Folks committee" is appointed to care for the aged. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system comprises the Brigham Young University at Provo, the Brigham Young College at Logan, and the Latter-Day Saints University at Salt lake City. There are also nearly a score of stake academies. There are four Mormon <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> in <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a>, the principal one being at <a href="../cathen/13404c.htm">Salt Lake City</a>. It was begun in April, 1853, and completed in April, 1893, costing, it is said, about $4,000,000. In these <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> ordinances are administered both for the living and the dead. It is held that vicarious work of this character, such as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, endowments etc., will be effectual in saving <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, once mortal, who believe and repent in the spiritual state. The Mormons claim a total membership of 584,000. [<em>Note:</em> As of 2005, this number stood at 11 million.] According to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Census Report of 21 May 1910, there are 256,647 Mormons within the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">Federal Union</a>.
