<h1>Moses</h1>  

<p>Hebrew liberator, leader, lawgiver, prophet, and historian, lived in the thirteenth and early part of the twelfth century, B. C.
<h2>Name</h2>

<p>Mosh&eacute;h (M. T.), <em>Mouses</em>, <em>Moses</em>. In <a href="../bible/exo002.htm#vrs10">Exodus 2:10</a>, a derivation from the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>Mashah</em> (to draw) is implied. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> and the Fathers assign the Coptic <em>mo</em> (water) and <em>uses</em> (saved) as the constituent parts of the name. Nowadays the view of Lepsius, tracing the name back to the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <em>mesh</em> (child), is widely patronized by Egyptologists, but nothing decisive can be established.
<h2>Sources</h2>

<p>To deny or to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the historic <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> of Moses, is to undermine and render unintelligible the subsequent history of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>. Rabbinical literature teems with legends touching every event of his marvellous career: taken singly, these popular tales are purely <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginative</a>, yet, considered in their cumulative force, they vouch for the reality of a grand and illustrious personage, of strong character, high purpose, and noble achievement, so deep, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and efficient in his religious convictions as to thrill and subdue the minds of an entire race for centuries after his death. The Bible furnishes the chief authentic account of this luminous life.
<h2>Birth to vocation (Exodus 2:1-22)</h2>

<p>Of Levitic extraction, and born at a time when by kingly edict had been decreed the drowning of every new male offspring among the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, the "goodly child" Moses, after three months' concealment, was exposed in a basket on the banks of the Nile. An elder brother (<a href="../bible/exo007.htm#vrs7">Exodus 7:7</a>) and sister (<a href="../bible/exo002.htm#vrs4">Exodus 2:4</a>), Aaron and Mary (AV and RV, <em>Miriam</em>), had already graced the union of Jochabed and Amram. The second of these kept watch by the river, and was instrumental in inducing <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh's</a> daughter, who rescued the child, to entrust him to a Hebrew nurse. The one she designedly summoned for the charge was Jochabed, who, when her "son had grown up", delivered him to the princess. In his new surroundings, he was schooled "in all the wisdom of the Egyptians" (<a href="../bible/act007.htm#vrs22">Acts 7:22</a>). Moses next appears in the bloom of sturdy manhood, resolute with sympathies for his degraded brethren. Dauntlessly he hews down an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> assailing one of them, and on the morrow tries to appease the wrath of two compatriots who were quarrelling. He is misunderstood, however, and, when upbraided with the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of the previous day, he fears his life is in jeopardy. <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> has heard the news and seeks to kill him. Moses flees to <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>. An act of rustic gallantry there secures for him a home with Raguel, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Sephora, one of Raguel's seven daughters, eventually becomes his wife and Gersam his <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>. His second son, Eliezer, is named in commemoration of his successful flight from <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>.
<h2>Vocation and mission (Exodus 2:23-12:33)</h2>

<p>After forty years of shepherd life, Moses speaks with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. To Horeb (Jebel Sherbal?) in the heart of the mountainous Sinaitic peninsula, he drives the flocks of Raguel for the last time. A bush there flaming unburned attracts him, but a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> voice forbids his approach and declares the ground so holy that to approach he must remove his shoes. The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a> designates him to deliver the Hebrews from the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> yoke, and to conduct them into the "land of milk and honey", the region long since promised to the seed of Abraham, the Palestine of later years. Next, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> reveals to him His name under a special form <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a> as a "memorial unto all generations". He performs two <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> to convince his timorous listener, appoints Aaron as Moses's "prophet", and Moses, so to speak, as Aaron's <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../bible/exo004.htm#vrs16">Exodus 4:16</a>). Diffidence at once gives way to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and magnanimity. Moses bids adieu to Jethro (Raguel), and, with his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, starts for <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. He carries in his hand the "rod of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>", a symbol of the fearlessness with which he is to act in performing signs and wonders in the presence of a hardened, threatening monarch. His confidence waxes strong, but he is uncircumcised, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> meets him on the way and fain would kill him. Sephora saves her "bloody spouse", and appeases <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcising</a> a son. Aaron joins the party at Horeb. The first interview of the brothers with their compatriots is most encouraging, but not so with the despotic sovereign. Asked to allow the Hebrews three days' respite for <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> in the wilderness, the angry monarch not only refuses, but he ridicules their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and then effectually embitters the Hebrews' minds against their new chiefs as well as against himself, by denying them the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> straw for exorbitant daily exactions in brick making. A rupture is about to ensue with the two strange brothers, when, in a vision, Moses is divinely constituted "Pharaoh's God", and is commanded to use his newly imparted powers. He has now attained his eightieth year. The episode of Aaron's rod is a prelude to the plagues. Either personally or through Aaron, sometimes after warning <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> or again quite suddenly, Moses causes a series of Divine manifestations described as ten in number in which he humiliates the sun and river gods, afflicts man and beast, and displays such unwonted control over the earth and heavens that even the magicians are forced to recognize in his prodigies "the finger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> softens at times but never sufficiently to meet the demands of Moses without restrictions. He treasures too highly the Hebrew labour for his public works. A crisis arrives with the last plague. The Hebrews, forewarned by Moses, celebrate the first <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a> or Phase with their loins girt, their shoes on their feet, and staves in their hands, ready for rapid escape. Then <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> carries out his dreadful threat to pass through the land and kill every <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of man and beast, thereby executing judgment on all the gods of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> can resist no longer. He joins the stricken populace in begging the Hebrews to depart.
<h2>Exodus and the forty years (Exodus 12:34 and after)</h2>

<p>At the head of 600,000 men, besides <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children, and heavily laden with the spoils of the Egyptians, Moses follows a way through the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, indicated by an advancing pillar of alternating cloud and fire, and gains the peninsula of Sinai by crossing the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>. A dry passage, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> opened by him for this purpose at a point today unknown, afterwards proves a fatal trap for a body of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> pursuers, organized by <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> and possibly under his leadership. The event furnishes the theme of the thrilling canticle of Moses. For upwards of two months the long procession, much retarded by the flocks, the herds, and the difficulties inseparable from <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> travel, wends its way towards Sinai. To move directly on <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a> would be too hazardous because of the warlike <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, whose territory would have to be crossed; whereas, on the south-east, the less formidable <a href="../cathen/01377c.htm">Amalacites</a> are the only inimical tribes and are easily overcome thanks to the intercession of Moses. For the line of march and topographical identifications along the route, see <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">ISRAELITES</a>, subsection <em>The Exodus and the Wanderings</em>. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> water obtained from the rock Horeb, and the supply of the quails and <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">manna</a>, bespeak the marvellous <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the great leader. The meeting with Jethro ends in an alliance with <a href="../cathen/09513b.htm">Madian</a>, and the appointment of a corps of judges subordinate to Moses, to attend to minor decisions. At Sinai the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">Ten Commandments</a> are <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, Moses is made mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the people, and, during two periods of forty days each, he remains in concealment on the mount, receiving from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the multifarious enactments, by the observance of which <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is to be moulded into a theocratic nation (cf. <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">MOSAIC LEGISLATION</a>). On his first descent, he exhibits an all-consuming <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the purity of Divine worship, by causing to perish those who had indulged in the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> orgies about the <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">Golden Calf</a>; on his second, he inspires the deepest awe because his face is emblazoned with luminous horns.

<p>After instituting the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and erecting the Tabernacle, Moses orders a census which shows an army of 603,550 fighting men. These with the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and children, duly celebrate the first anniversary of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a>, and, carrying the <a href="../cathen/01721a.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a>, shortly enter on the second stage of their migration. They are accompanied by Hobab, Jethro's son, who acts as a guide. Two instances of general discontent follow, of which the first is punished by fire, which ceases as Moses <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, and the second by plague. When the <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">manna</a> is complained of, quails are provided as in the previous year. Seventy elders &#151; a conjectural origin of the <a href="../cathen/13444a.htm">Sanhedrin</a> &#151; are then appointed to assist Moses. Next Aaron and Mary <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> their brother, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> vindicates him and afflicts Mary temporarily with <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>. From the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Pharan Moses sends spies into <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, who, with the exceptions of <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a> and Caleb, bring back startling reports which throw the people into consternation and rebellion. The great leader <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> intervenes, but only to condemn the present generation to die in the wilderness. The subsequent uprising of Core, Dathan, Abiron, and their adherents suggests that, during the thirty-eight years spent in the Badiet et-Tih., habitual discontent, so characteristic of nomads, continued. It is during this period that tradition places the composition of a large part of the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a>. Towards its close, Moses is doomed never to enter the Promised Land, presumably because of a momentary lack of trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> at the Water of Contradiction. When the old generation, including Mary, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> sister, is no more, Moses inaugurates the onward march around <a href="../cathen/07638a.htm">Edom</a> and <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moab</a> to the Arnon. After the death of Aaron and the victory over Arad, "fiery serpents" appear in the camp, a chastisement for renewed murmurings. Moses sets up the brazen serpent, "which when they that were bitten looked upon, they were healed". The victories over Sehon and Og, and the feeling of security animating the army even in the territory of the hostile Balac, led to presumptuous and <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> intercourse with the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> <a href="../cathen/10409b.htm">Moabites</a> which results, at Moses's command, in the slaughter of 24,000 offenders. The census, however, shows that the army still numbers 601,730, excluding 23,000 <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>. Of these Moses allows the Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasses to settle in the east-Jordan district, without, however, releasing them from service in the west-Jordan conquest.
<h2>Death and posthumous glory</h2>

<p>As a worthy legacy to the people for whom he has endured unparalleled hardships, Moses in his last days pronounces the three memorable discourses preserved in Deuteronomy. his chief utterance relates to a future Prophet, like to himself, whom the people are to receive. He then bursts forth into a sublime song of praise to Jahweh and adds prophetic <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> for each of the twelve tribes. From Mount Nebo &#151; on "the top of Phasga" &#151; Moses views for the last time the Promised Land, and then dies at the age of 120 years. He is buried "in the valley of Moab over against Phogor", but no man "knows his sepulchre". His memory has ever been one of "isolated grandeur". He is the type of Hebrew <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, so far outshining other models that twelve centuries after his death, the Christ Whom he foreshadowed seemed eclipsed by him in the minds of the learned. It was, humanly speaking, an indispensable providence that represented him in the Transfiguration, side by side with Elias, and quite inferior to the incomparable Antitype whose coming he had predicted.
