<h1>Moulins</h1>  

<p>D<font size=-2>IOCESE OF</font> M<font size=-2>OULINS</font> (M<font size=-2>OLINENSIS</font>).

<p>Suffragan of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> &#151; comprises the entire department of Allier. Under the old regime Moulins did not even have a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, the churches which served as <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were succursal churches of two neighbouring country <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, Yseure and St-Bonnet. In 1788 a see was created at Moulins; and des Gallois de la Tour, who exercised in that city the functions of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but had not been <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a> when the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> broke out in 1789. The See of Moulins was re-established by the Concordat of 1817, and had titulars from 1822. This new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was formed of dismembered parts of the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont-Ferrand</a>. In this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> the cantonal districts do not bear their geographical names, as in all other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, but the name of a saint which becomes the patron of the deanery: the Vichy deanery, for instance, is called the deanery of St-Raphael. <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a> came to Moulins in November, 1429, and from there wrote letters to all the important surrounding towns, asking for assistance. In 1604 Henry IV authorized the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to found a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at Moulins. The devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus was inaugurated in 1676 at the Visitation <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Moulins; <a href="../cathen/08282c.htm">St. Jane Frances de Chantal</a> died in this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in 1641. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Saint Lieu Sept Fons, in the present territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was founded in 1132 by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> on a site where there were seven springs (<em>septem fontes</em>) and a sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin; it was reformed in 1663 by Dom Eustache de Beaufort, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> from 1656 to 1709, a friend of de Ranc&eacute;. In 1845 the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was restored by the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappist</a> Dom Stanislaus Lapierre. St. Beno&icirc;t Labre passed two months there in 1769. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Souvigny, founded in 916, had a fine <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a>, where even yet the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of many Seigneurs de Bourbon can be seen. Saint Mayeul (Majolus), second <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Cluny, died at Souvigny in 994, and <a href="../cathen/11207c.htm">St. Odilo</a>, third <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Cluny, died there in 1049. The town of Gannat arose about an ancient abbey of Augustinians; the town of St. Pour&ccedil;ain owes its origin to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> founded in the sixth century by the slave St. Pour&ccedil;ain (Portianus) who put a stop to the devastations of Thierry, King of Austrasia, during his campaign against Auvergne. The preacher Jean de Lingendes (1595-1665) and the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> Abb&eacute; Chatel, founder of the "French Catholic Church" (1795-1857), were born in the territory of the present Diocese of Moulins.

<p>The principal <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Notre-Dame de St. Germain des Foss&eacute;s; the body of the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> St. Patroclus (sixth century) at Colombier; the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Mayeul at Souvigny; and the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. George at Bourbon l'Archambault, which possesses one of the largest known fragments of the Holy Cross, a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> given by St. Louis to his son Robert of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>. Before the application of the Associations Law of 1901 there were <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a>, <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, Missionary Fathers of the Sacred heart, and several orders of School Brothers in the Diocese of Moulins. At the beginning of the twentieth century the religious congregations of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> had charge of: 1 cr&egrave;che, 15 day nurseries, 2 boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 10 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 5 industrial rooms, 1 <a href="../cathen/09524a.htm">Magdalen</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, 6 "houses of mercy" for the relief of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, 13 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or asylums, 3 houses for the care of the sick in their own homes.

<p>In 1908 the Diocese of Moulins counted 390,812 inhabitants, 31 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 281 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 55 vicariates.
