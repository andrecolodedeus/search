<h1>Mount Thabor</h1>  

<p>The name of Mount Thabor, <img alt="Image" src="../images/14551a01.gif" height=16>, is rendered in the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> as <img alt="Image" src="../images/14551a02.gif" height=16>, and in Jeremias and Osee as <img alt="Image" src="../images/14551a03.gif" height=16>. It is under this last form (Itabyrion or Atabyrion) that the mount figures in the historical works of the ancients. The <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> call it Jebel et Tur (mountain of mountains), a name which they give likewise to Mounts Garizim, Sinai, and Olivet. Mount Thabor is distinguished among the mountains of Palestine for its picturesque site, its graceful outline, the remarkable vegetation which covers its sides of calcareous rock, and the splendour of the view from its summit. Nearly isolated on all sides and almost hemispherical in shape it rises in a peak 1650 feet above the Plain of Esdraelon, which it bounds on the north and east, about five miles south-east of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>. It attains a height of 1843 feet above the level of the Mediterranean and of 2540 feet above that of the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Lake of Tiberias</a>. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Bell. Jud., IV, i, 8) gives it a height of thirty stadia, or 18,201 feet, but he doubtless made use of the figure <img alt="Image" src="../images/14551a04.gif" height=12> (four stadia or 2427 feet), which the copyist must have replaced by <img alt="Image" src="../images/14551a05.gif" height=12> (thirty). The summit forms an oblong plateau about 3000 feet long, from north-west to south-east, by 1000 wide. The eye is immediately attracted to the north-east by the gigantic masses of <a href="../cathen/07288a.htm">Great Hermon</a>, then to the Valley of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">Jordan</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Lake of Tiberias</a> and the mountain chains of Hauran, Basan, and Galaad. To the south are Naim and Endor at the foot of Jebel Daby or Mount Moreh (<a href="../bible/jdg007.htm#vrs1">Judges 7:1</a>), wrongly identified by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> with Little Hermon (Ps. xli, 7); somewhat farther off is seen Mount Gelboe. Westward the rich plain of Esdrelon stretches as far as Mount Carmel and innumerable Biblical and historical localities stir thoughts of the past.

<p>Mount Thabor is the object of poetical comparisons on the part of the Psalmist (<a href="../bible/psa088.htm">Psalm 88:13</a>), the Prophet Jeremias (<a href="../bible/jer046.htm">46:18</a>), and the Prophet Osee (<a href="../bible/hos005.htm">5:1</a>). The beautiful mountain also played an important part in history. There the Prophetess Debbora secretly assembled 10,000 <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> under the command of <a href="../cathen/02281a.htm">Barac</a>, who subsequently swept down upon the army of Sisara and put it to flight at the torrent of Cison (<a href="../bible/jdg006.htm#vrs2">Judges 6:2</a>-<a href="../bible/jdg007.htm#vrs18">7:18-19</a>). At the division of the Promised Land, Thabor formed the boundary between Isachar and <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">Zabulon</a> (<a href="../bible/jos019.htm#vrs22">Joshua 19:22</a>). Within the tribe of <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">Zabulon</a>, but near Dabereth, a city of Isachar, the Book of <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Josue</a> (<a href="../bible/jos019.htm">19:12</a>) mentions the city of Coseleththabor, in Hebrew Chisloth-Thabor, which means "slope or side of Thabor". <a href="../bible/1ch006.htm">1 Chronicles 6:77</a> also speaks of a city of <a href="../cathen/15739b.htm">Zabulon</a> called simply Thabor and assigned to the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> descended from Merari. This is an abbreviated form of the name of the same city, and is probably the same as that which as Dabour figures among the Galilean cities conquered by Rameses II, according to the "Papyrus Anastasii" (I, xxii, 2). Polybius (Hist., V, lxx, 6) relates that in 218 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> Antiochus the Great captured by stratagem the city of Atabyrion in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. History makes no further mention of this city, not even in connexion with the bloody battles fought at the foot of Mount Thabor in 53 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> between Alexander, the son of Aristobulus, and Gabinius, the lieutenant of Pompey ("Ant. Jud.", XIV, vi, 3; "Bell. Jud.", I, viii, 7). <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> alone again refers to it in the words "Dabira &hellip; a village of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> on Mount Thabor" ("Onom.", ed. Klostermann, 78). Dabereth (<a href="../bible/jos019.htm#vrs12">Joshua 19:12</a>; <a href="../bible/jos021.htm#vrs28">21:28</a>) is indisputably the modern village of Dab&#251;riy&eacute;h, at the foot of Mount Thabor towards the west.

<p>A ten minutes' ascent northward from <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> brings one to the ruins of a Hebrew place called by the natives Khirbet Daboura (ruins of Daboura) and also Abu Amo&#251;d (father of columns). This is the site of the Biblical Ciseleth Thabor, of the Daboura of the Egyptians, and the Atabyrion of the Greeks. It commanded the road of caravans and armies. During the revolt of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> against the Romans, <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> surrounded "the plateau of Thabor" with a wall of circumvallation twenty-six stadia or about two miles in circumference, which task was accomplished in forty days. This formed a kind of entrenched camp where the rebels, pursued from all directions, sought refuge in order to organize their last stand. <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian's</a> lieutenant, Placidus, marched against them with a force of 600 horsemen, enticed them into the plain by stratagem, and completely defeated them ("Vita", 37; "Bell. Jud.", II, iv, xx, 6; i, 8). In the fourth century of our era Mount Thabor, which was acknowledged as the scene of <a href="../cathen/15019a.htm">Christ's Transfiguration</a>, became a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> and was surmounted by a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> and several <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. In 1101 the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> rebuilt the sacred edifices and erected a fortified <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, where they withstood several attacks by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, but after the battle of Hattin (1187) they had to abandon the mountain. Melek el Adel built there (1210-12) a large and solid fortress which the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> attacked in vain in 1217; in the following year Melek el Adel caused it to be dismantled. The plateau of Mount Thabor is now occupied by <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and Schismatic Greek <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>.
