<h1>Munk&aacute;cs</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, of Greek <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Rite, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>. It dates from the fifteenth century. Until then the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Greek Ruthenians</a> who had <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> a generation before, 1254, were subject to the <a href="../cathen/12532a.htm">See of Przemysl</a>. In 1458 the Diocese of Munk&aacute;cs is mentioned for the first time in a document of King Mathias as a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> with episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. It was probably established between 1439 and 1458, as the document mentions that Lucas, the occupant of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, had already exercised the usual <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> for a considerable period. Its history is connected with that of the <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Csernekhegy near Munk&aacute;cs, established supposedly in 1360 by Duke Theodore Koriatovics, but demonstrably as late as 1418. The history of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> falls naturally into three periods. Until 1641, when union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> took place, Munk&aacute;cs endeavoured to extend its episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the thirteen districts (Komitate) of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, later its territory. The second period lasts from 1641 to 1771, when the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was canonically established. A third period brings its history down to the present. Of its history during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> very little, especially in regard to the mode of episcopal appointment, although it was probably by election until 1561, with the exception of the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> in 1458. In King Wladislaw II's documents a certain John is mentioned as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1491 and 1498; thence until 1551 we hear nothing more about the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, nor are we even sure that the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was occupied. The first document recording the actual appointment of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> dates from 1623. In 1641, under Bishop Theodore Tharassovics (1639-48), union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was facilitated by the wish to have done with dependence on the lords of Munk&aacute;cs, but George Rikoczi I of <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>, Lord of Munk&aacute;cs, being unfavourably disposed towards union, took Tharassovics <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, and, although the latter obtained his freedom in 1642, he did not regain possession of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. In 1649 the union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was again proclaimed by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Munk&aacute;cs influenced by Bishop George Jakusich of Eger; henceforth, especially from 1689, date the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Eger to bring Munk&aacute;cs into close subjection.

<p>After the union of 1649, Peter Parthenius was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Munk&aacute;cs, and was confirmed both by King Leopold and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. His death was followed by a period of decadence: the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was divided into several parts, administered more or less independently of one another, and conflicts arose between the emperor, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and the R&aacute;k&oacute;czi <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, concerning the right of <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1689 through the efforts of Archbishop Kolonics, Joseph de Camelis, a Greek, devoted his chief energy towards fostering the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the people and extirpating incontinence among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. To promote these objects he held twelve <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> within three years, that of <a href="../cathen/14419b.htm">Szatm&aacute;r</a> being of special importance. After Camelis's death the right of appointment was again disputed. King Joseph I appointed Joseph Hodermarszky <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1705; Francis R&aacute;k&oacute;czi II, as Lord of Munk&aacute;cs, filled the episcopal office independently; the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, on its part, appointed an administrator, not regarding the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> legally established for lack of canonical creation. Hodermarszky had to resign the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1715, and the endeavours of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Eger to treat Munk&aacute;cs as a suffragan thus triumphed. Hodermarszky's successor, Gennadius Bizanczi (1716-33), had already acted as Vicar Apostolic. Both he and still more his successor, Michael Olsavszky, contested the authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Eger; Olsavszky's successor, John Brad&aacute;cs, continued the conflict, and finally triumphed. In 1771, the See of Munk&aacute;cs was established canonically by <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a>, Bradacs becoming first canonical <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Under him the chapter, with seven canons, was also established. In 1816 the See of Eperjes was separated from Munk&aacute;cs, and in 1856 ninety-four <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were incorporated in the new See of Szamosujv&aacute;r. Basil Popovics (1837-64) made a lasting impression on the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; Stephen Pankovics (1866-74) displayed great activity in the domain of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> administration, and John P&aacute;szt&eacute;lyi-Kov&aacute;cs (1879-94) performed especially prominent service in the cause of public <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Since 1894 Julius Fircz&aacute;k has been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The residence is at Ungv&aacute;r. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is divided into two vicariates (M&aacute;rmaros and Hajdu-Dorog), seven archdeaneries, and forty-eight vice-archdeaneries. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> number 387, the right of patronage being exercised by ninety patrons, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> over 500. There are five <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and the chapter consists of six canons.
