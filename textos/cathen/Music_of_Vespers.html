<h1>Music of Vespers</h1>  

<p>The texts (e.g. <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, psalms, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>) sung in <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> vary according to the feast or the season of the church year; and in churches where it is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> to recite publicly the Canonical Hours of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> the <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> must follow the direction of the "Ordo". The <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1868) decreed (no. 379) that complete vespers be sung on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feasts in all churches, as far as possible, after the Roman fashion, and that vespers never be replaced by other exercises of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; "for the solemn worship approved by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and flourishing through so many centuries must be deemed pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a>". To facilitate the introduction of <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, the council further legislated (no. 380) that the rudiments of <a href="../cathen/06779a.htm">Gregorian chant</a> be taught in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, "so that gradually the greater part of the congregation might be enabled to join with the sacred <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> and the choir" in singing. A <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">Rescript</a> of the Congregation of Sacred Rites (11 Mar., 1882, Montereyen. et Angelor. n. 3539, 3) declared that the custom which had obtained in certain churches, of singing some verses of all or of some psalms in <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> and of omitting the others, should be wholly eliminated; and two years later the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1884) decreed (no. 118): "Moreover we will and command&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. that, where the office of <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> is performed, complete <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, that is, with integral psalms, be sung."

<p>The difficulty of preparing different <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, psalms, etc., for the various <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feasts overtaxed the powers of ordinary choirs; and happily a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the S.R.C. (29 Dec., 1884, Lucionen. n. 3624, 12) met the difficulty by declaring that in mere <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, where there is no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of public recitation of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, but where <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> are sung for the devotion of the people, the <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> may be taken from any Office, such as that of the Most <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> or of the Blessed Virgin, provided that the sacred <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> privately recite the <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> proper to the day. It is therefore clear that in practically all churches in English-speaking countries the choir may repeat the same <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, selected from any appropriate feast, for every <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> or feast. Composers and publishers of <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a> have further simplified the task of the choir by issuing brochures which contain all the ceremonial or <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrical</a> directions in English, in their appropriate place, and which give easy musical settings to the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, psalms, etc., or furnish easy accompaniments to the <a href="../cathen/12144a.htm">plainsong</a> melodies. Must the <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> thus selected at the pleasure of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or the choirmaster be complete in every part, e.g., the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>? Johner (p. 14) declares that "such <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> must accord in every respect with the <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> of the Office selected". The <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a> follows the Fourth <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> in the desire that "in vespers on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, the entire five psalms, and the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> proper to the occurring feast should never be omitted, unless the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> deems it impossible to observe this rule on account of local circumstances". In this connection, the discussion in the "Ecclesiastical Review" (Dec., 1911) should be consulted.

<p>The texts must be either sung or "recited" in a clear and intelligible manner. The portions that must be sung are: the first verse of the "Magnificat", the first and last verse of the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>, the verses where genuflection is prescribed (e.g. "Veni Creator", "O Crux Ave" on the Feasts of the Holy Cross, "Ave Maris Stella") or where all bow the head (e.g. the "Gloria Patri"). The "Ceremonial of Bishops" permits alternate verses of the "Magnificat" to be supplied by the <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a>, provided the choir meanwhile recites the text in an intelligible voice or--a better arrangement--a single chanter sings the text to accompaniment of the <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a>. The S.R.C. (Senogallien., 4 Mar., 1901, V) permits a similar arrangement for the psalms, but adds the condition that there be a poverty of voices (e.g. one or two voices on each side of the choir, as the Ephemerid. liturg., XV, 353, interprets). The "Ceremonial of Bishops" forbids the playing of the <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a> on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> and <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>, except Gaudete and L&aelig;tare <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> (the third of <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> and the fourth of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>); but a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">Rescript</a> of the S.R.C. (11 May, 1911) permits the <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a> to be played when it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for sustaining the voices, provided it ceases when the voices cease. The S.R.C. (Senogallien., 4 Mar., 1901, VII) requires a pause to be made at the asterisk in each verse of the psalms, "any custom whatsoever to the contrary notwithstanding".

<p>The general musical character of vespers is indicated in the "Instruction on Sacred Music" issued by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> (22 Nov., 1903), no. IV, 11. Classical polyphony or modern music may be used, although the <a href="../cathen/06779a.htm">Gregorian chant</a> is the typical setting for the texts. While the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> should regularly be in the assigned <a href="../cathen/06779a.htm">Gregorian</a> melodies, it is permitted occasionally to sing them in figured music; but in this case "they must never have either the form of a concert melody or the fullness of a <a href="../cathen/10600c.htm">motet</a> or cantata". While the "Gloria Patri" and "Sicut erat" may also be in figured music, the psalms should regularly be in <a href="../cathen/06779a.htm">Gregorian chant</a>; but on greater feasts the verses in <a href="../cathen/06779a.htm">Gregorian chant</a> may be alternated with verses in <em>falsibordoni</em> or "with verses similarly composed in a proper manner". Single psalms may sometimes be sung wholly in modern music, "provided the form proper to psalmody be preserved in such compositions; that is, provided the singers seem to be psalmodizing among themselves, either with new motifs, or with those taken from the <a href="../cathen/06779a.htm">Gregorian chant</a> or based upon it". The "Instruction" immediately adds that "psalms known as <em>di concerto</em> are, therefore, forever excluded and prohibited". These <em>di concerto</em> psalms are "theatrical compositions&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. with soli, chorus, and orchestra, comprising adagios, allegros, and often dance airs" (Duclos, 106, footnote 2). <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> alludes to these in his letter to <a href="../cathen/12786a.htm">Card. Respighi</a> (8 Dec., 1903): "For the devout psalmody of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, in which the people also used to join, there have been substituted interminable musical compositions on the words of the Psalms, all of them modelled on old theatrical works, and most of them of such meagre artistic value that they would not be tolerated for a moment even in second-rate concerts. Certain it is that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and devotion are not promoted by them; the curiosity of some of the less intelligent is fed, but the majority, disgusted and <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a>, wonder how it is that such an abuse can still survive. We, therefore, wish the cause to be completely extirpated, and that the solemnity of vespers should be celebrated according to the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> rules indicated by us." As to the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>, the "Ceremonial of Bishops" permits recitation of alternate stanzas with accompaniment of <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a>.
