<h2>History</h2>

<p>Originally Mysore belonged to the <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Archdiocese of Goa</a>, but what early mission work was done there is a matter of obscurity. In the Canarese or western portions a mission seems to have been established about the middle of the seventeenth century; in the eastern or Telugu portion another mission was brought into existence about the year 1703 by two <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> who came from Vellore and founded churches at Bangalore, Devanhalli, Chikka, Ballapoora, and elsewhere. But their work was stopped and partly destroyed by the fanaticism of the sultan, Tipu (1782-99). The district came under the Foreign Mission Society of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1776, which at that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> began work at <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>. The celebrated Abb&eacute; Dubois (b. 1765, d. 1848), himself a member of the Foreign Missions, spent most of his life among the Canarese <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Ganjam, Palhally and Satthully (see DUBOIS). Mysore was included in the Vicariate of the Coromandel Coast (Pondicherry), erected in 1836, but was separated in 1845, and erected into a distinct vicariate-Apostolic in 1850, at the same time as the district of <a href="../cathen/04095a.htm">Coimbatore</a>. On the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in 1886 it was made into a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> suffragan to Pondicherry with the same boundaries as now.
