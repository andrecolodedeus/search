<h1>Mystery</h1>  

<p>(Greek <em>mysterion</em>, from <em>myein</em>, "to shut", "to close".)

<p>This term signifies in general that which is unknowable, or valuable <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that is kept secret. In <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> antiquity the word mystery was used to designate certain esoteric doctrines, such as Pythagoreanism, or certain ceremonies that were performed in private or whose meaning was known only to the initiated, e.g., the Eleusinian rites, Phallic worship. In the language of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> the mysteries were those religious teachings that were carefully guarded from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the profane (see <a href="../cathen/05032a.htm">D<font size=-2>ISCIPLINE OF THE</font> S<font size=-2>ECRET</font></a>).
<h2>Notion of mystery in Scripture and in theology</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old-Testament</a> versions use the word <em>mysterion</em> as an equivalent for the <a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>s&ocirc;d</em>, "secret" (<a href="../bible/pro020.htm#vrs19">Proverbs 20:19</a>; <a href="../bible/jth002.htm#vrs2">Judith 2:2</a>; <a href="../bible/sir022.htm#vrs27">Sirach 22:27</a>; <a href="../bible/2ma013.htm#vrs21">2 Maccabees 13:21</a>). In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> the word mystery is applied ordinarily to the sublime revelation of the Gospel (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#vrs11">Matthew 13:11</a>; <a href="../bible/col002.htm#vrs2">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#vrs9">1 Timothy 3:9</a>; <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs51">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>), and to the Incarnation and life of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> and His manifestation by the preaching of the Apostles (<a href="../bible/rom016.htm#vrs25">Romans 16:25</a>; <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#vrs4">Ephesians 3:4</a>; <a href="../bible/eph006.htm#vrs19">6:19</a>; <a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs26">Colossians 1:26</a>; <a href="../bible/col004.htm#vrs3">4:3</a>).

<p>In conformity with the usage of the inspired writers of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> give the name <em>mystery</em> to <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> that surpass the powers of natural reason. Mystery, therefore, in its strict <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> sense is not synonymous with the incomprehensible, since all that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is incomprehensible, i.e., not adequately comprehensible as to its inner being; nor with the unknowable, since many things merely natural are accidentally unknowable, on account of their inaccessibility, e.g., things that are future, remote, or hidden. In its strict sense a mystery is a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, one that of its very nature lies above the finite intelligence.

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> distinguish two classes of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> mysteries: the <em>absolute</em> (or <em>theological</em>) and the <em>relative</em>. An <em>absolute</em> mystery is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> whose existence or possibility could not be discovered by a creature, and whose essence (inner substantial being) can be expressed by the finite mind only in terms of analogy, e.g., the Trinity. A <em>relative</em> mystery is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> whose innermost nature alone (e.g., many of the <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a>), or whose existence alone (e.g., the positive ceremonial <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>), exceeds the natural knowing power of the creature.
<h2>Catholic doctrine</h2>

<p>The existence of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> mysteries is a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> defined by the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, which declares: "If any one say that in Divine Revelation there are contained no mysteries properly so called (<em>vera et proprie dicta mysteria</em>), but that through reason rightly developed (<em>per rationem rite excultam</em>) all the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can be understood and demonstrated from natural principles: let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>" (Sess. III, Canons, 4. De fide et Ratione, 1). This teaching is clearly explained in Scripture. The principal <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> text, which was cited in part by the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, is <a href="../bible/1co002.htm">1 Corinthians 2</a>. Shorter passages are especially <a href="../bible/eph003.htm#vrs4">Ephesians 3:4-9</a>; <a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs26">Colossians 1:26-27</a>; <a href="../bible/mat011.htm#vrs25">Matthew 11:25-27</a>; <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs17">John 1:17-18</a>. These texts speak of a mystery of God, which only <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> wisdom can understand, namely, the designs of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> and the inner life of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> (see also <a href="../bible/wis009.htm#vrs16">Wisdom 9:16-17</a>; <a href="../bible/rom011.htm#vrs33">Romans 11:33-36</a>). Tradition abounds with testimonies that support this teaching. In the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Gravissimas Inter" (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchiridion", ed. Bannwart, nn. 1666-74), <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> defends the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> mystery by many citations from the works of the Fathers. Numerous other patristic texts that bear on the same question are quoted and explained in <a href="../cathen/08667a.htm">Kleutgen's</a> "Die Theologie der Vorzeit", II, 75 sq.; V, 220 sq.; and in <a href="../cathen/13524a.htm">Sch&auml;zler's</a> "Neue Untersuchungen &uuml;ber das Dogma von der Gnade" (Mainz, 1867), 466 sq. The manifold excellence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> revelation offers many <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> arguments for the existence of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> mysteries (cf. Scheeben, "Dogmatik", I, 24).
<h2>Reason and supernatural mystery</h2>
<h3 id="A">Errors</h3>

<p>The existence of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> mysteries is denied by <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> and semi-Rationalists. <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> object that mysteries are degrading to reason. Their favourite argument is based on the principle that no medium exists between the reasonable and the unreasonable, from which they conclude that the mysterious is opposed to reason (Bayle, Pfleiderer). This argumentation is fallacious, since it confounds incomprehensibility with inconceivableness, superiority to reason with contradiction. The mind of a creature cannot, indeed, grasp the inner nature of the mysterious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but it can express that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by analogies; it cannot fully understand the coherence and agreement of all that is contained in a mystery of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but it can refute successfully the objections which would make a mystery consist of mutually repugnant elements.

<p><a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> further object that the revelation of mysteries would be useless, since it is the nature of reason to accept only the evident (Toland), and since the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the incomprehensible can have no influence on the moral life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> (<a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>). To answer the first objection we have only to recall that there is a twofold evidence: the internal evidence of a thing in itself, and the external evidence of trustworthy authority. The mysteries of revelation, like the facts of history, are supported by external evidence and therefore they are evidently credible. The second difficulty rests on a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> assumption. The <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is rooted in his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, which is an anticipation of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> (<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, "Comp. Theol. ad fratrem Reg., " cap. ii), a profound act of religious homage (Contra. Gent., I, vi), and the measure by which he judges the world and the ways of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The history of civilization bears witness to the beneficial influence that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has exerted on the general life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> (cf. Gutberlet, "Apologetik," II, 2 ed., M&uuml;nster, 1895, 23).

<p>Some <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a>, trusting to far-fetched similarities, pretend that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mysteries were borrowed from the religious and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> systems of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Paganism</a>. A study of the origin of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> suffices to show the absurdity of such an explanation. Semi-Rationalism explains mysteries either as purely natural <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> expressed in symbolic language (Schelling, Baader, Sabatier), or as soluble problems of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> (G&uuml;nther, Frohschammer). The <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of G&uuml;nther were condemned in a pontifical letter to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> in 1857, and in another to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a> in 1860 (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchiridion", ed. Bannwart, nn. 1655-1658); those of Frohschammer, in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Gravissimas Inter", 11 Dec., 1862.
<h3 id="B">Relations of natural and supernatural truth</h3>

<p><em>(a) Superiority of the Supernatural</em>

<p>The mysteries contained in <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation are not simply disconnected <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> lying beyond the realm of natural things, but a higher, heavenly world, a mystical <em>cosmos</em> whose parts are united in a living bond. (<a href="../cathen/13525b.htm">Scheeben</a>, "Dogmatik", I, 25.) Even in those parts of this vast system that have been revealed to us there is a wonderful harmony. In his great work "Die Mysterien des Christenthums", <a href="../cathen/13525b.htm">Scheeben</a> has sought to show the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> connection in the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a> by considering its supreme mystery, the internal communication of Divine life in the Trinity, as the model and ideal of the external communication to the creature of the Divine life of grace and glory. The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> is more excellent than any human wisdom, because, although incomplete, it has a nobler object, and through its dependence on the unfailing word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> possesses a greater degree of certitude. The obscurity which surrounds the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> results from the weakness of the human <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which, like the eye that gazes on the sun, is blinded by the fulness of light.

<p><em>(b) Harmony of Natural and Supernatural Truth</em>

<p>Since all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there can be no real <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> between reason and revelation. Supernatural mysteries as such cannot be demonstrated by reason, but the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> can always show that the arguments against their possibility are not conclusive (<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, "Suppl. Boeth. de trinitate", Q. ii, a. 3). The <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">nature of God</a> which is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> and eternal, must be incomprehensible to an intelligence that is not capable of perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (cf. Zigliara, "Prop&aelig;deutica", I, ix). The powerlessness of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> to solve the mysteries of nature, a fact that <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> admit, shows how limited are the resources of the human <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/04639a.htm">Daumer</a>, "Des Reich des Wundersamen und Geheimnissvollen," <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, 1872). On the other hand reason is able not only to recognize wherein consists the special mysteriousness of a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but also to dispel to some extent the obscurity by means of natural analogies and to show the fittingness of the mystery by reasons of congruity (Council of Cologne, 1860). This was done with great success by the Fathers and the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. A famous example is <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas'</a> argument <em>ex convenientia</em> for the Divine processions in the Trinity (Summa Theol., I, QQ. xxvii-xxxi). (See <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">FAITH</a>, <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">REASON</a>, <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">REVELATION</a>.)
