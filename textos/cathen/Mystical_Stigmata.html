<h1>Mystical Stigmata</h1>  

<p>To decide merely the facts without deciding whether or not they may be explained by <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> causes, history tells us that many <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstatics</a> bear on hands, feet, side, or brow the marks of the <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">Passion of Christ</a> with corresponding and intense sufferings. These are called visible stigmata. Others only have the sufferings, without any outward marks, and these phenomena are called invisible stigmata.
<h2 id="section1">Facts</h2>

<p>Their existence is so well established <a href="../cathen/07635a.htm">historically</a> that, as a general thing, they are no longer disputed by unbelievers, who now seek only to explain them naturally. Thus a <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">free-thinking</a> physician, Dr. Dumas, professor of religious <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, clearly admits the facts (Revue des Deux Mondes, 1 May, 1907), as does also Dr. Pierre Janet (Bulletin de l'Institut psychologique international, Paris, July, 1901).

<p><a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a> at first had visible stigmata but through <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> she asked that they might be made invisible, and her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was heard. This was also the case with <a href="../cathen/03444a.htm">St. Catherine de' Ricci</a>, a Florentine <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> of the sixteenth century, and with several other stigmatics. The sufferings may be considered the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> part of visible stigmata; the <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of this grace consists of pity for Christ, participation in His sufferings, sorrows, and for the same end--the expiation of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> unceasingly committed in the world. If the sufferings were absent, the <a href="../cathen/15714a.htm">wounds</a> would be but an empty symbol, theatrical representation, conducing to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. If the stigmata really come from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it would be unworthy of His wisdom to participate in such futility, and to do so by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>.

<p>But this trial is far from being the only one which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have to endure: "The life of stigmatics," says Dr. Imbert, "is but a long series of sorrows which arise from the Divine malady of the stigmata and end only in death: (op. cit. infra, II, x). It seems historically <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstatics</a> alone bear the stigmata; moreover, they have <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">visions</a> which correspond to their r&ocirc;le of co-sufferers, beholding from time to time the blood-stained scenes of the Passion.

<p>With many stigmatics these <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparitions</a> were periodical, e.g., <a href="../cathen/03444a.htm">St. Catherine de' Ricci</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasies</a> of the Passion began when she was twenty (1542), and the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of her <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> states that for twelve years they recurred with minute regularity. The <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> lasted exactly twenty-eight hours, from Thursday noon till Friday afternoon at four o'clock, the only interruption being for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> to receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>. Catherine conversed aloud, as if enacting a drama. This drama was divided into about seventeen scenes. On coming out of the <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> limbs were covered with wounds produced by whips, cords etc.

<p>Dr. Imbert has attempted to count the number of stigmatics, with the following results:

<p><strong>1.</strong> None are known prior to the thirteenth century. The first mentioned is <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, in whom the stigmata were of a character never seen subsequently; in the wounds of feet and hands were excrescences of flesh representing nails, those on one side having round back heads, those on the other having rather long points, which bent back and grasped the skin. The saint's <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> could not prevent a great many of his brethren beholding with their own eyes the existence of these wonderful wounds during his lifetime as well as after his death. The fact is attested by a number of contemporary historians, and the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the Stigmata of St. Francis is kept on 17 September.

<p><strong>2.</strong> Dr. Imbert counts 321 stigmatics in whom there is every reason to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in a Divine action. He believes that others would be found by consulting the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In this list there are 41 men.

<p><strong>3.</strong> There are 62 <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> or blessed of both sexes of whom the best known (numbering twenty-six) were:

<ul> <li><a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a> (1181-1226); <li>St. Lutgarde (1182-1246), a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a>; <li><a href="../cathen/09653b.htm">St. Margaret of Cortona</a> (1247-97); <li><a href="../cathen/06534a.htm">St. Gertrude</a> (1256-1302), a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>; <li><a href="../cathen/04006a.htm">St. Clare of Montefalco</a> (1268-1308), an Augustinian; <li><a href="../cathen/01482a.htm">Bl.

Lucy of <a href="../cathen/10704a.htm">Narni</a> (1476-1547), <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> tertiary; <li>Bl.

<p><strong>4.</strong> There were 20 stigmatics in the nineteenth century. The most famous were:

<ul> <li><a href="../cathen/05406b.htm">Catherine Emmerich</a> (1774-1824), Augustinian; <li>Elizabeth Canori Mora (1774-1825), <a href="../cathen/15045d.htm">Trinitarian</a> <a href="../cathen/14520b.htm">tertiary</a>; <li><a href="../cathen/14430b.htm">Anna Maria Ta&iuml;gi</a> (1769-1837); <li>Maria Dominica Lazzari (1815-48); <li>Marie de Moerl (1812-68) and Louise Lateau (1850-83), <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/14520b.htm">tertiaries</a>.</ul>

<p>Of these, Marie de Moerl spent her life at Kaltern, Tyrol (1812-68). At the age of twenty she became an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstatic</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> was her habitual condition for the remaining thirty-five years of her life. She emerged from it only at the command, sometimes only <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> who was her director, and to attend to the affairs of her house, which sheltered a large <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Her ordinary attitude was kneeling on her bed with hands crossed on her breast, and an expression of countenance which deeply impressed spectators. At twenty-two she received the stigmata. On Thursday evening and Friday these stigmata shed very clear blood, drop by drop, becoming dry on the other days. Thousands of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> saw Marie de Moerl, among them G&ouml;rres (who describes his visit in his "Mystik", II, xx), <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a>, and Lord Shrewsbury, who wrote a defence of the <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstatic</a> in his letters published by "The Morning Herald" and "The Tablet" (cf. <a href="../cathen/16011a.htm">Bor&eacute;</a>, op. cit. infra).

<p>Louise Lateau spent her life in the village of Bois d'Haine, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> (1850-83). The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> she received were disputed even by some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who as a general thing relied on incomplete or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> information, as has been established by Canon Thiery ("Examen de ce qui concerne Bois d'Haine", Louvain, 1907). At sixteen she devoted herself to nursing the cholera victims of her <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, who were abandoned by most of the inhabitants. Within a month she nursed ten, buried them, and in more than one instance bore them to the cemetery. At eighteen she became an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstatic</a> and stigmatic, which did not prevent her supporting her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> by working as a seamstress. Numerous physicians witnessed her painful Friday <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasies</a> and established the fact that for twelve years she took no nourishment save weekly <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">communion</a>. For drink she was satisfied with three or four glasses of water a week. She never slept, but passed her nights in contemplation and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, kneeling at the foot of her bed.
<h2 id="section2">Explanations</h2>

<p>The facts having been set forth, it remains to state the explanations that have been offered. Some physiologists, both <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">Free-thinkers</a>, have maintained that the wounds might be produced in a purely natural manner by the sole action of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> coupled with lively emotions. The <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> being keenly impressed by the sufferings of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> and penetrated by a great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, this preoccupation acts on her or him physically, reproducing the <a href="../cathen/15714a.htm">wounds of Christ</a>. This would in no wise diminish his or her <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> in accepting the trial, but the immediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the phenomena would not be <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>.

<p>We shall not attempt to solve this question. Physiological <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> does not appear to be far enough advanced to admit a definite solution, and the writer of this article adopts the intermediate position, which seems to him unassailable, that of showing that the arguments in favour of natural explanations are illusory. They are sometimes arbitrary hypotheses, being equivalent to mere assertions, sometimes arguments based exaggerated or misinterpreted facts. But if the progress of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medical sciences</a> and psycho-physiology should present serious objections, it must be remembered that neither religion or <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> is dependent on the solution of these questions, and that in processes of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> stigmata do not count as incontestable <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.

<p>No one has ever claimed that <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> could produce wounds in a normal subject; it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that this faculty can act slightly on the body, as <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> said, it may accelerate or retard the nerve-currents, but there is no instance of its action on the tissues (De canoniz., III, xxxiii, n. 31). But with regard to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in an abnormal condition, such as <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> or hypnosis, the question is more difficult; and, despite numerous attempts, <a href="../cathen/07604b.htm">hypnotism</a> has not produced very clear results. At most, and in exceedingly rare cases, it has induced exudations or a sweat more or less coloured, but this is a very imperfect imitation. Moreover, no explanation has been offered of three circumstances presented by the stigmata of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>:

<ol><li>Physicians do not succeed in curing these wounds with remedies. <li>On the other hand, unlike natural wounds of a certain duration, those of stigmatics do not give forth a fetid odour. To this there is known but one exception: <a href="../cathen/13064a.htm">St. Rita of Cassia</a> had received on her brow a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> wound produced by a thorn detached from the crown of the crucifix. Though this emitted an unbearable odour, there was never any suppuration or morbid alteration of the tissues. <li>Sometimes these wounds give forth perfumes, for example those of Juana of the Cross, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/12428a.htm">prioress</a> of Toledo, and Bl. Lucy of Narni.</ol>

<p>To sum up, there is only one means of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proving</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientifically</a> that the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, that is auto-suggestion, may produce stigmata: instead of hypothesis, analogous facts in the natural order must be produced, namely wounds produced apart from a religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. This had not been done.

<p>With regard to the flow of blood it has been objected that there have been bloody sweats, but Dr. Lefebvre, professor of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, has replied that such cases as have been examined by physicians were not due to a moral cause, but to a specific malady. Moreover, it has often been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the microscope that the red liquid which oozes forth is not blood; its colour is due to a particular substance, and it does not proceed from a wound, but is due, like sweat, to a dilatation of the pores of the skin. But it may be objected that we unduly minimize the power of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, since, joined to an emotion, it can produce sweat; and as the mere <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of having an acid bon-bon in the mouth produces abundant saliva, so, too, the nerves acted upon by the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> might produce the emission of a liquid and this liquid might be blood. The answer is that in the instances mentioned there are glands (sudoriparous and salivary) which in the normal state emit a special liquid, and it is easy to understand that the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> may bring about this secretion; but the nerves adjacent to the skin do not terminate in a gland emitting blood, and without such an organ they are powerless to produce the effects in question. What has been said of the stigmatic wounds applies also to the sufferings. There is not a single experimental <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> could produce them, especially in violent forms.

<p>Another explanation of these phenomena is that the patients produce the wounds either <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraudulently</a> or during attacks of somnambulism, unconsciously. But physicians have always taken measures to avoid these sources of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, proceeding with great strictness, particularly in modern times. Sometimes the patient has been watched night and day, sometimes the limbs have been enveloped in sealed bandages. Mr. Pierre Janet placed on one foot of a stigmatic a copper shoe with a window in it through which the development of the wound might be watched, while it was impossible for anyone to touch it (op. cit. supra).
