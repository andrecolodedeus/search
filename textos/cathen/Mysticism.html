<h1>Mysticism</h1>  

<p>(From <em>myein</em>, to initiate).

<p><em>Mysticism</em>, according to its etymology, implies a relation to mystery. In philosophy, Mysticism is either a religious tendency and desire of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> towards an intimate union with the Divinity, or a system growing out of such a tendency and desire. As a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> system, Mysticism considers as the end of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> the direct union of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the Divinity through contemplation and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and attempts to determine the processes and the means of realizing this end. This contemplation, according to Mysticism, is not based on a merely analogical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Infinite, but as a direct and immediate <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> of the Infinite. According to its tendency, it may be either speculative or practical, as it limits itself to mere <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or traces <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> for action and life; contemplative or affective, according as it emphasizes the part of intelligence or the part of the will; <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> or heterodox, according as it agrees with or opposes the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a>. We shall give a brief historical sketch of Mysticism and its influence on philosophy, and present a criticism of it.
<h2>Historical sketch</h2>

<p>In his "History of Philosophy", Cousin mentions four systems, between which, he says, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> thought has continually wavered, viz., Sensism, <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">Idealism</a>, Scepticism, and Mysticism. Whatever may be thought of this classification, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that Mysticism has exercised a large influence on philosophy, becoming at times the basis of whole systems, but more often entering as an element into their constitution. Mysticism dominated in the symbolic philosophy of ancient <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. The Taoism of the <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Lao-tze is a system of <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> and ethics in which Mysticism is a fundamental element (cf. De Harlez, "Laotze, le premier philosophe chinois", in "M&eacute;moires couronn&eacute;s et autres de l'Acad&eacute;mie", <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, January, 1886). The same may be said of Indian philosophy; the end of human reflection and effort in <a href="../cathen/02730a.htm">Brahmanism</a> and Vedantism is to deliver the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from its transmigrations and absorb it into Brahma forever. There is little of Mysticism in the first <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Greek philosophy, but it already takes a large place in the system of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, e.g., in his theory of the world of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, of the origin of the world <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of recollection and <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a>. The Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> Philo (30 B.C-A.D. 50) combined these <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> elements with the data of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and taught that every man, by freeing himself from matter and receiving illumination from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, may reach the mystical, <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstatic</a>, or prophetical state, where he is absorbed into the Divinity. The most systematic attempt at a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> system of a mystical character was that of the Neoplatonic School of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, especially of Plotinus (A.D. 205-70) in his "Enneads". His system is a <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">syncretism</a> of the previous <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophies</a> on the basis of Mysticism--an emanative and <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> Monism. Above all being, there is the One absolutely indetermined, the absolutely Good. From it come forth through successive emanations intelligence (<em>nous</em>) with its <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, the world-soul with its plastic forces (<em>logoi spermatikoi</em>), matter inactive, and the principle of imperfection. The human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had its existence in the world-soul until it was united with matter. The end of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> and of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is to realize the mystical return of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Freeing itself from the sensuous world by purification (<em>katharsis</em>), the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> ascends by successive steps through the various degrees of the metaphysical order, until it unites itself in a confused and unconscious contemplation to the One, and sinks into it: it is the state of <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasis</a>.

<p>With <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, the history of Mysticism enters into a new period. The Fathers recognized indeed the partial <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> system, but they pointed out also its fundamental <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. They made a distinction between reason and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>; they acknowledged the aspirations of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but, at the same time, they emphasized its essential inability to penetrate the mysteries of Divine life. They taught that the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a> is the work of grace and the reward of eternal life; in the present life only a few <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, by a special grace, can reach it. On these principles, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> opposed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> gnosis based on grace and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic heresies</a>. St. Augustine teaches indeed that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the essences of things <em>in rationibus aeternis</em>, but this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> has its starting point in the data of sense (cf. Qu&aelig;stiones, LXXXIII, c. xlvi). <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a>, in his various works, gave a systematic treatment of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Mysticism, carefully distinguishing between rational and mystical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. By the former, he says, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not in His nature, but through the wonderful order of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, which is a participation of the Divine <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> ("De Divinis Nomin.", c, vii, &#167;&#167; 2-3, in P.G., III, 867 sq.). There is, however, he adds, a more perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> possible in this life, beyond the attainments of reason even enlightened by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, through which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> contemplates directly the mysteries of Divine light. The contemplation in the present life is possible only to a few privileged <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, through a very special <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a>: it is the <em>theosis, mystike enosis</em>.



<p>The works of <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a> exercised a great influence on the following ages. John Scotus Eriugena (ninth century), in his "De Divisione Natur&aelig;", took them as his guide, but he neglected the distinction of his master, identifying philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and creatures, and, instead of developing the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Dionysius, reproduced the <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> theories of Plotinus (see <a href="../cathen/05519a.htm">JOHN SCOTUS ERIUGENA</a>). In the twelfth century, <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Mysticism was presented under a systematic form by the Victorines, Hugh, Walter, and Richard (cf. Mignon, "Les Origines de la Scolastique et Hugues de St. Victor", Paris, 1895), and there was also a restatement of Eriugena's principles with <a href="../cathen/01379b.htm">Amaury de B&egrave;ne</a>, <a href="../cathen/08406c.htm">Joachim de Floris</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04645a.htm">David of Dinant</a>. A legitimate element of Mysticism, more or less emphasized, is found in the works of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> of the thirteenth century. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries there was, as a protest against a sterile dialecticism, a revival of mystical systems, some <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>--J. Ruysbroek, <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a>, Peter d'Ailly, Denys the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a>--and others <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heterodox</a>&mdash;John of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, John of Mirecourt, the <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguines and Beghards</a>, and various brotherhoods influenced by <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroism</a>, and especially <a href="../cathen/05274a.htm">Meister Eckhart</a> (1260-1327), who in his "Opus Tripartitum" teaches a deification of man and an assimilation of the creature into the Creator through contemplation (cf. <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a> in "Archiv f&uuml;r Literatur und Kirchengeschichte des Mittelalters", 1886), the "Theologia Germanica", and, to a certain extent, <a href="../cathen/11060b.htm">Nicholas of Cusa</a> (1401-64) with his theory of the <em>coincidentia oppositorum</em>. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, by its negation of all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority and by advocating a direct union of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, had its <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> outcome in a Mysticism mostly <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Mysticism is represented by Sebastian Frank (1499-1542), by Valentine Weiler (1533-88), and especially by J. B&ouml;hme (1575-1624), who, in his "Aurora", conceived the <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">nature of God</a> as containing in itself the energies of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and identified the <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">Divine nature</a> with the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> whose operation is to kindle, according to its <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, the fire of good or the fire of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (cf. Deussen, "J. B&ouml;hme ueber sein Leben und seine Philosophie", Kiel, 1897). Reuchlin (1455-1522) developed a system of cabalistic Mysticism in his "De arte cabalistica" and his "De verbo mirifico". We may also assign to the influence of Mysticism the ontological systems of <a href="../cathen/09568a.htm">Malebranche</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">Ontologists</a> of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The romantic Mysticism of Fichte (1762-1814), Novalis (1772-1801), and Schelling (1775-1854) was a reaction against the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> of the eighteenth century. A pseudo-Mysticism is also the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> outcome of the <a href="../cathen/06068b.htm">Fideism</a> and evolutionistic Subjectivism of modern <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, inaugurated by Lessing (1728-81), developed by Schleiermacher (1768-1834), A. <a href="../cathen/13086a.htm">Ritschl</a> (1822-89; cf. Goyau, "L'Allemagne Religieuse, Le Protestantisme", 6th ed., Paris, 1906), Sabatier, etc., and accepted by the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernists</a> in their theories of vital immanence and religious experience (cf. <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Pascendi"). (See <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">MODERNISM</a>.)
<h2>Criticism</h2>

<p>A tendency so universal and so persistent as that of Mysticism, which appears among all peoples and influences <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> thought more or less throughout all centuries, must have some real foundation in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. There is indeed in the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a natural desire for, an aspiration towards the highest <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the absolute <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the highest, the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> good. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by experience and reason that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and enjoyment of created things cannot give the fulness of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the perfection of beatitude which will completely satisfy our desires and aspirations. There is in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a capacity for more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and perfection than we can ever acquire through the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of created things. We realize that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is the end of man, that in the possession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone we can reach the satisfaction of our aspirations. (Cf. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, <em>Summa Theologica</em> <a href="../summa/1002.htm#article1">I:2:1</a>; <a href="../summa/1012.htm#article1">I:12:1</a>; <a href="../summa/1044.htm#article4">I:44:4</a>; <a href="../summa/2003.htm#article8">I-II:3:8</a>; "Contra Gentes", III, cc. i, xxv, l; "De Veritate", Q. xxii, a. 2; "Compend. Theologi&aelig;", 104, etc.) But the rational effort of our intelligence and positive aspirations of our will find here their limits. Is there truly possible a union of our reason and will with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> more intimate than that which we possess through created things? Can we expect more than a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by analogical concepts and more than the beatitude proportionate to that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? Here <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> cannot answer. But where reason was powerless, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> gave way to feeling and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. They dreamt of an <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> of the Divinity, of a direct contemplation and immediate possession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. They imagined a notion of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> and of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> that would make possible such a union. They built systems in which the world and the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> were considered as an emanation or part of the Divinity, or at least as containing something of the Divine essence and Divine <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> outcome was <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>.

<p>This result was a clear evidence of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> at the starting-point. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as guardian of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>, through her teaching and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, gave the solution of the problem. She asserted the limits of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>: the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has a natural capacity (<em>potentia obedientialis</em>), but no exigency and no positive ability to reach <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> otherwise than by analogical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. She condemned the immediate vision of the <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beghards and Beguines</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, "Enchiridion", nn. 474-5), the pseudo-Mysticism of <a href="../cathen/05274a.htm">Eckhart</a> (ibid., nn. 501-29), and Molinos (ibid., nn. 2121-88), the theories of the <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">Ontologists</a> (ibid., nn. 1659-65, 1891-1930), and <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> under all its forms (ibid., nn. 1801-5), as well as the vital Immanence and religious experience of the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernists</a> (ibid., nn. 2071-109). But she teaches that, what man cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by natural reason, he can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> through revelation and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; that what he cannot attain to by his natural power he can reach by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has gratuitously elevated <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> state. He has assigned as its ultimate end the direct vision of Himself, the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">Beatific Vision</a>. But this end can be reached only in the next life; in the present life we can but prepare ourselves for it with the aid of revelation and grace. To some <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, however, even in the present life, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives a very special grace by which they are enabled to feel His sensible presence; this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> mystical contemplation. In this act, there is no annihilation or absorption of the creature into <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> becomes intimately present to the created mind and this, enlightened by special illuminations, contemplates with ineffable <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> the Divine essence.
