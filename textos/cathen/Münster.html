<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Province of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Secular history</h2>

<p>The earliest name of M&uuml;nster was Mimegerneford, the later form being Mimigardeford, while from 1076 it was called by the Latin name Monasterium. It is first mentioned in 795, when <a href="../cathen/09415a.htm">St. Ludger</a> founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> here, and the place became his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> when he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Even at this early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> it must have been a place of some importance. Among the earliest possessions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at M&uuml;nster were three large landed estates, apparently the gift of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. These lands, at least in part, lay within the area of the later city. They were called the Brockhof, the Kampwordeshof, and the Bispinghof. The last-named belonged to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and, probably for this reason, bore his name. The Brockhof was owned by the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, the Kampwordeshof belonged later to the collegiate <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Moritz, to which it was apparently assigned when the church was founded. The fourth great estate, and one that is mentioned from the earliest days, the Judefelderhof, appears to have belonged originally to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, by which it was given in fief to a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> called J&uuml;defeld. In 1386 the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter obtained it by purchase. Near these four estates were quite a number of farms owned independently by free peasants; many of these in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> came into the possession of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09415a.htm">St. Ludger</a> was placed in the centre of these properties on the ground now surrounding the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. From the beginning the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was independent of the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the count. How large a district enjoyed this immunity cannot now be ascertained. Neither, for lack of original authorities, can the extent of the guild in which the free peasants were united be positively settled, nor the earliest state of the community and the legal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> exercised in it. In regard to the public administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, M&uuml;nster was from the earliest times under the authority of the Counts of Dreingau until, on account of the privileges granted by <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the count were transferred to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who exercised them, especially the higher <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, through governors. The relation of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the commune in the early period is not entirely clear, though it is evident that he exercised a certain influence over the affairs of the community.

<p>At first the population was very small: there appears to have been a large increase in the eleventh century, when, in addition to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the churches of Ueberwasser (1040), St. Moritz (about 1070), and <a href="../cathen/08757a.htm">St. Lambert</a> (after 1085) were built. M&uuml;nster at this time offered great advantages to merchants and mechanics, besides being the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, with a chapter and <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Thus, close to the episcopal castle, that had been built near the minster, there arose an outlying city in which commerce and trade were fairly prosperous, as early as the twelfth century. In 1115 the castle was provided with walls, gateways, and a moat. In the twelfth century three more <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches were built, those of <a href="../cathen/09415a.htm">St. Ludger</a>, mentioned in 1173, St. &AElig;gidius (1181), and St. Martin (before 1199). By the end of the twelfth century the place was virtually a city, although it cannot be ascertained when the distinctive municipal privileges were secured by it. From not later than 1168 the city formed a separate judicial district, and with this the development into a municipality was essentially complete. Yet M&uuml;nster was not a free imperial city; it was always dependent on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In 1173 the right of administering the city passed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. From the thirteenth century these two powers entrusted the exercise of legal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to officials (<em>ministerialen</em>) of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. From the thirteenth century, in addition to the judge appointed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, there were city judges, who are first mentioned in 1255. They were appointed by the burgomasters from the members of the city council. When court was held they sat by the judge, who was the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> appointee in order to guard the interests of the city, but outside of this had not much influence. The city council acted as a board of assessors in the city court. The extensive commerce of the city rapidly increased its importance. As early as 1253 it formed a defensive alliance with the neighboring cities of <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, Dortmund, Soest, and Lippstadt, and one with the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter in 1257. At a later date it joined the confederation of the cities of the Rhine, and about 1368 entered the Hanseatic League. In this period the commercial relations of M&uuml;nster extended as far as <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, and eastwards to Livonia and Novgorod.

<p>During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries important changes appeared in the government of the city. In <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> the population consisted of citizens and non-citizens. The citizen body was divided into the ruling patricians, who from the sixteenth century were also called "hereditary proprietors", and the commonalty. A body of city patricians can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have existed at M&uuml;nster from the thirteenth century. At least the burgomasters and the members of the city council were chosen from a limited number of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. From the fourteenth century the patricians had control of the court of the city; they maintained themselves in the sole ownership of the city government up into the fifteenth century. The representatives of the city were the burgomasters, first mentioned in 1253, and the assessors, mentioned in 1221. Besides its judicial authority, the body of assessors performed the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of a city council. It was presided over by the burgomasters, who, from 1268, were not appointed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but by those citizens (<em>guden luden</em>) who had the right of voting. Taking advantage of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> pecuniary needs, the municipality gradually obtained large <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges. Thus, besides its own autonomy, it acquired the military authority, the administration of a number of church <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a>, and supreme <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in certain courts in the neighbouring towns and villages. In the fourteenth century it had a court formed from its own council. After 1309 it was represented in the diet of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> along with the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter and the lower nobility.



<p>Nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> always appointed the judges and reserved to himself the confirmation of sentence in important cases. He levied the town-taxes which, however, he generally mortgaged; he owned the mint, and claimed certain <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> at the death of every citizen. The guilds formed by the leading trades in the fourteenth century (in the sixteenth century seventeen guilds are mentioned) originally exercised no control over the city government; in the second half of that century they formed a confederation. Thus confederated, the guilds were able to influence both the internal and external affairs of the city, working apparently in amicable agreement with the Council. In 1447 the confederated guilds were regarded as a ruling corporation co-ordinate and acting in union with the Council. Their veto could stop any proceedings of the Council, which was still chosen from the patrician body. On the other hand, the Council retained a certain right of supervision over the internal affairs of the guilds. A good understanding between Council and guilds was, therefore, the primary condition for a prosperous development of the city. As a matter of fact the two bodies worked harmoniously together until the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> feud which split the city into two armed camps (see below, under II). In 1454, after the close of this feud, it was decided to choose the burgomasters and members of the Council thenceforward from both the patricians and mass of the citizens. This arrangement was maintained until the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptist</a> outbreak. Internal peace promoted prosperity and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and learning flourished greatly. M&uuml;nster was regarded as the leading commercial city between the Rhine and the Weser, and the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> conducted by the Canon Rudolf of Langen had a great reputation.

<p>In 1533-35, however, M&uuml;nster was the scene of the wild excesses of the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a>. During the episcopate of Bishop Frederick III, brother of Hermann of Wied, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> spread widely in the Diocese of M&uuml;nster. In his agreement with the city (14 February, 1533) Bishop Franz of Waldeck ceded to it full religious liberty and granted the six <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches to the adherents of the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, in return for which the city promised him obedience and support against the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. From 1533 the city undertook the preparation of new church ordinances. The drawing up of a form of worship was assigned to Bernt Rothmann, a preacher of <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptist</a> proclivities. Supported by some preachers from Wassenberg in J&uuml;lich and by the Melchiorites (followers of Melchior Hoffmann), he began to spread his views. The strength of the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptist</a> party was steadily increased by accessions from <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, until, in February, 1534, their leaders, John of Leyden, a tailor, and Jan Matthiesen, a baker, came to M&uuml;nster from <a href="../cathen/07095a.htm">Haarlem</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> gained complete control of the city, and the peaceable minority either left the city <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> or were expelled. The <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> now indulged in the wildest orgies in "the New Jerusalem", as they called M&uuml;nster, introducing <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a> and communism, plundering and selling churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>.

<p>Notwithstanding his inclination to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was now <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to go to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the city in order to maintain his <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authority</a>. In alliance with Philip of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, he began (28 February, 1534) a siege of the city in which John of Leyden, as king of the New Zion, had established a reign of terror. After a siege of sixteen months the city was taken in a bloody assault (25 June, 1535). The leaders of the insurrections were executed with horrible tortures and their bodies were exposed in three cages hung on the tower of <a href="../cathen/08757a.htm">St. Lambert's</a> Church. The return of the expelled citizens and the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> proceeded slowly. A small <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> community was still maintained. In 1553 the city regained its old privileges and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Trade, commerce, and learning once more flourished. Although disputes now arose between the guilds and the town council, and these two combined against the growing importance of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, M&uuml;nster enjoyed general peace and prosperity until the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a>. Several times during that <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> the city was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to pay heavy contributions, but it was not utterly impoverished like so many other cities.

<p>The peace negotiations carried on at M&uuml;nster by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Powers, beginning in 1643, led to the neutralization of the city and its substantial benefit. Thus encouraged, the Council, a few years after the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, persuaded the citizens to make a bold attempt to throw off the sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and raise M&uuml;nster to the rank of a free city of the empire. In the struggle with the Prince-Bishop Christopher Bernhard of Galen, M&uuml;nster was defeated in March, 1661. It lost its privileges, and an episcopal citadel, the Paulsburg, was erected in the western part of the city. Never, while the prince-bishops remained rulers, did M&uuml;nster regain its full civic liberty. After the Seven years' War, during which M&uuml;nster was not able to hold out against a second siege, in 1759, the fortifications were turned into promenades, and the citadel razed. In place of the latter a castle was built in 1768 as a residence for the prince-bishop. In 1780 a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was founded with the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppressed Jesuits</a> and of the Abbey of Ueberwasser. A circle of learned men gathered at M&uuml;nster around the <a href="../cathen/06367a.htm">Princess Galitzin</a>, among them being <a href="../cathen/14299b.htm">Frederick Leopold Count zu Stolberg</a> and <a href="../cathen/11362a.htm">Overbeck</a>.

<p>By the Imperial delegate's enactment, the city of M&uuml;nster and a part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> fell to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, which had already (23 May, 1802) made an agreement concerning it with the <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Consul Bonaparte</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> troops under Bl&uuml;cher entered the city, 3 August. A commission accompanied the army to shape the constitution and administration of the newly-acquired district conformably with the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> model. Although the president of the commission, Freiherr von Stein, showed a very friendly spirit towards the city, yet the suppression of its independence and the overbearing behaviour of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> officers disgusted the citizens with <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> supremacy. M&uuml;nster joyfully welcomed the French, who entered it in 1806, after the defeat of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> at Jena and Auerst&auml;dt. In 1808 the city was assigned to the Grand Duchy of Berg, in 1810 to <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and in 1811 to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, as capital of the Department of Lippe. The old city-government was dissolved and replaced by the French municipal organization. Many good measures of administration were introduced, but the enthusiasm for them was rapidly chilled by the extensive billeting of soldiers upon the citizens, and by arbitrary action, especially in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters. When, therefore, after the overthrow of the <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> power at the battle of Leipzig, the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussians</a> again entered M&uuml;nster, they, in turn, were greeted with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government was wise enough to retain many improvements made by the French, which they further developed, so that the city quickly reached an unprecedented prosperity. In 1836 the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> municipal ordinance was applied to M&uuml;nster. The population, 13,000 at the beginning of the nineteenth century, rapidly increased with the growth of commerce and traffic, and, as capital of the Province of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, the quiet <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> city developed into an important centre of traffic for North-Western <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>.

<p>According to the census taken at the close of 1905, M&uuml;nster had 81,468 inhabitants, of whom 67,221 were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 13,612 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and 555 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; in 1910 the population was about 87,000, including 72,800 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The city has 25 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, including 12 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions of learning are: the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> with (in the summer of 1910) 316 students; the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for priests; 2 preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, namely, the Collegium Borrom&aelig;um and the Collegium Ludgerianum; a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> state gymnasium; a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for teachers; a high school for girls.
<h2 id="section2">Diocesan history</h2>

<p>Towards the end of the Saxon War, <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> founded, about 795, several Saxon <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, all suffragans of Cologne, among them M&uuml;nster, or Mimigerneford. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Ludger, who, since the year 787, had been a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> missionary in five Frisian "hundreds", or districts. The territory of the Diocese of M&uuml;nster was bounded on the west, south, and north-west by the Dioceses of Cologne and Utrecht, on the east and north-east by Osnabr&uuml;ck. The diocese also included districts remote from the bulk of its territory, namely, the five Frisian hundreds on the lower Ems (Hugmerki, Hunusgau, Fivelgau, Federitgau, and Emsgau), also the island of Bant, which has disappeared, leaving behind it the islands of Borkum, Juist, and Norderney. Mention has already been made above (see I) of the earliest landed estates of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Most of the territory over which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> eventually exercised sovereign <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> lay north of the River Lippe, extending as far as the upper Ems and the Teutoburg Forest. The most important accession was in 1252, when the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> purchased the Countship of Vechta and the district of Meppen. The country between these new districts was acquired later: in 1403 the district about Cloppenburg and Oyte was gained, in 1406 the manorial domain of Ahaus and the castle of Stromberg with its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; and in 1429 Wideshausen in pledge from the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>. This last addition made the new territory, which was entirely separate from the southern part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, a compact body subsequently known as "the lower diocese"; it remained an integral part of the Diocese of M&uuml;nster until the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, which somewhat reduced its size; what was left was retained until the secularization.

<p>St. Ludger established his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> as Mimegerneford and founded there a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, following the rule of Bishop Chrodegang of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> living in community. But the most important <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> founded by <a href="../cathen/09415a.htm">St. Ludger</a> was the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Werden, which became a nursery for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He also assisted in founding the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Nottuln, under his sister Heriburg. He was succeeded in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by two nephews, Gerfrid (809-39) and Altfrid (839-49), both of whom also presided over the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/15589a.htm">Werden</a>. The special connexion of Werden with the diocese ceased on the appointment of the next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Luitbert (849-71), who was not related to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the founder. There were even disputes between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which the Synod of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> settled in favour of the latter, awarding it the right of freely electing its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Bishop Wulfhelm (875-95) changed the collegiate body founded by Lutger into a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, with which he divided the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> till then held in common, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> having thenceforth his special residence. Among the religious foundations of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in the ninth century should be mentioned the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> at <a href="../cathen/09237a.htm">Liesborn</a> (814), Vreden (about 839), Freckenhorst (before 857), and Metelen (before 889). The development of religious and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life was checked in the first part of the tenth century by political disquiet. Better days did not begin until the reign of <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Emperor Otto I</a> (936-73). Under Bishop Duodo (867-93), in 968, the abbey of Borghorst was founded for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; the same <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> built a stone <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> near the old wooden one. Hermann I (1032-42) founded the Abbey of Our Lady of Ueberwasser; Bishop Frederick I, Count of Wettin (1064-84), established the collegiate <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Moritz at M&uuml;nster; Bishop Erpho (1085-97) built the church of <a href="../cathen/08757a.htm">St. Lambert</a>. Both the two just named and Bishop Burchard of Holte (1098-1118) were partisans of the emperor in the investiture conflict. During the episcopate of Dietrich II, Count of Zutphen (1118-27), several Pr&aelig;monstratensian and <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> arose. Hermann II (1174-1203) founded collegiate churches for the canons of <a href="../cathen/09415a.htm">St. Ludger</a> and St. Martin.

<p>The twelfth century was marked by a considerable growth of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>. Bishop Ludwig I, Count of Tecklenburg (1169-73), restored to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> the temporal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over its domains previously exercised by the Counts of Tecklenburg. Hermann II, like his immediate predecessors, <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, Count of Are (1152-68), and Ludwig I, was a partisan of <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>. With the overthrow of Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony, the last obstacle in the way of the complete sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was removed, and Hermann appears as a great feudatory of the empire. During the episcopate of his second successor, Dietrich III of Isenburg (1218-26), the position of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as a prince of the empire was formally acknowledged in 1220 by <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>. Hermann II was the last <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> directly appointed by the emperor. Dissensions arose about the election of his successor, <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a>, Count of Oldenburg (1204-18), and Emperor <a href="../cathen/11357a.htm">Otto IV</a> decreed that thenceforward the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter alone should elect the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The See of Cologne retained the right of confirmation, and the emperor that of investiture. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> temporal authority was limited in important matters; particularly in taxation, the consent of representative bodies of his subjects was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Among these, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter appears early in the thirteenth century; later, the lower nobility, and, lastly, the city of M&uuml;nster. In course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter extended its <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> by agreements made with <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> before election.

<p>The temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> increased greatly during the episcopate of Bishop <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>, Count of Lippe (1247-59). The city, at the same time, struggled to become independent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, not, however, with complete success, notwithstanding its alliance with the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. Even as early as the eleventh century the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> all belonged to noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, generally to those possessing lands in the neighbourhood; only too often the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was administered for the benefit rather of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> than of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were, in consequence, frequently involved in the quarrels of the nobility; <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs were neglected and the prosperity of the inhabitants of the prince-bishopric suffered. Conditions were at their worst during what is known as the M&uuml;nster Diocesan Feud (1450-57). The arbitrary conduct of Bishop Henry II of M&ouml;rs (1424-50) had aroused a very bitter feeling in the city. After his death the majority of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter elected Walram of M&ouml;rs, brother of Henry and also <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, while the city and a minority of the chapter demanded the election of Eric of Hoya, brother of Count John of Hoya. Although the election of Walram was confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, open <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> for the possession of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> broke out, and Walram was unable to gain possession of the city of M&uuml;nster. In 1457, after his death, a compact was made by which Eric of Hoya received a life income, and the privileges of the city were confirmed, while both parties recognized the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, John II, Count Palatine of Simmern (1457-66). After order had been re-established, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was taken seriously in hand. Bishop Henry III of Schwarzburg (1466-96), Conrad of Rietberg (1497-1508), and Eric of Saxe-Lauenburg (1508-22) produced excellent results by holding <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> and reforming religious foundations. Rudolf of Langen and John Murmellius made the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> a nursery of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanism</a>.

<p>Under the indolent and thoroughly worldly Frederick III (1522-32), brother of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, Hermann of Wied, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> spread rapidly after 1524, especially in the city. Scarcely any opposition to the innovation was made by the next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Franz of Waldeck (1532-53), who from the first planned to aid the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in his three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of M&uuml;nster, <a href="../cathen/10323a.htm">Minden</a>, and Osnabr&uuml;ck, in order to form out of these three a secular principality for himself. He was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a>, indeed, for the sake of his endangered authority, to proceed against the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> in the city of M&uuml;nster; but he did little for the restoration of the Faith, and at last joined the Smalkaldic League. <a href="../cathen/08629c.htm">William of Ketteler</a> (1553-57) was more <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> than <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>: although he regarded himself as an administrator of the old Church, and took the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, he refused to comply with the demands of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and resigned in 1557. Bernhard of Raesfeld (1557-66) was genuinely devoted to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, but he, too, finding himself unequal to the difficulties of his position, resigned. John of Hoya (1566-74), a faithful <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, in order to reorganize <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, undertook a general visitation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in the years 1571-73. The visitation revealed shocking conditions among <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people, and showed to what extent the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> had spread in the diocese under previous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Not only were <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> predominant in the northern part of the country, or "lower <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>", but the western part as well had been almost entirely lost to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the cities in other parts of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, too, the Faith had suffered greatly.

<p>The good this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> accomplished was almost undone after his death. His successor, John William of Cleves (1574-85), inherited the Duchy of Cleves in 1575, married, and gave up the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. A long diplomatic battle as to his successor arose between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> powers, during which the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was administered by Cleves. The maintenance of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was assured by the victory of Ernst of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1585-1612), who was also <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Freising, <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>. He <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> undertook the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>, invited the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to aid him, and encouraged the founding of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the old orders, although he could not repair all the losses. The western part of the Frisian district under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> of M&uuml;nster was transferred, in 1569, to the newly-founded <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> of Groningen and Deventer, and with them fell into <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. In the same way the possessions of the Counts of Bentheim-Steinfurt and some other fortified towns passed from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The two immediate successors of Bishop Ernst laboured in the same spirit. Ferdinand of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1612-50) was at the same time Elector of Cologne and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>. He founded a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which he placed under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Christopher Bernhard of Galen (1650-78) was equally efficient both as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and as secular ruler; he forced the refractory city of M&uuml;nster, after a long siege, to acknowledge his sovereign <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, succeeded in freeing his territory from foreign troops, gained parts of the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/15589a.htm">Diocese of Werden</a> in a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Sweden, restored church discipline, and established a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system for his territory.

<p>The immediate successors of the three distinguished rulers just mentioned were Ferdinand II of F&uuml;rstenberg (1678-83), Maximilian Henry of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1683-88), Frederick Christian of Plettenberg (1688-1712), and Francis Arnold of Wolf-Metternich (1708-18). Unfortunately, under these men church discipline declined, and much that was excellent decayed for lack of proper care, or, like the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, ceased to exist. The next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was the frivolous, vain, and pomp-loving Clement Augustus of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1719-61), who was also Elector of Cologne, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>. During his episcopate the diocese suffered terribly, in 1734-35 and during the Seven Years War, being almost ruined financially. The succeeding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Maximilian Frederick of K&ouml;nigsegg-Rottenfels (1761-84), who was also Elector of Cologne, was a weak, though well-meaning man. Happily, he left the administration of the Diocese of M&uuml;nster to a young <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canon, <a href="../cathen/06325a.htm">Franz Friedrich Wilhelm von F&uuml;rstenberg</a>, during whose administration the diocese attained unexampled prosperity. At the election of an <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>, von F&uuml;rstenberg was defeated by Maximilian Franz of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, who became the last Prince-Bishop of M&uuml;nster and Elector of Cologne (1774-1801). Upon the death of Maximilian Franz, his nephew, the Archduke Anthony Victor, was elected, but could not enter upon the administration on account of the opposition of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, which had long coveted the domains of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Northern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>.

<p>In 1803 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was secularized by the Imperial Delegates Enactment and broken up into numerous parts. The larger share was assigned to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, which took possession in March, 1803. The rich treasury of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was transferred to Magdeburg and has never been returned. Freiherr von F&uuml;rstenberg administered as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> even during the short supremacy of the French (1806-13). After his death, in 1810, the administrator was his former coadjutor, <a href="../cathen/05161b.htm">Clement Augustus von Droste-Vischering</a>, later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>. In the years 1813-15 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was administered, without the authorization of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, by Count Ferdinand Augustus von Spiegel, arbitrarily appointed by <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, and to whom <a href="../cathen/05161b.htm">Droste-Vischering</a> had given his faculties by subdelegation. In 1813 the principality was again ceded to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. Upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reorganization of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, completed by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 16 July, 1821, "De salute animarum", the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was given its present boundaries (see below). The see had been vacant for twenty years when Ferdinand von Lunninck (1821-25), formerly Prince-Bishop of Corvey, was appointed. On account of illness, he left the administration to Jodok Hermann von Zurm&uuml;hlen, already an old man, whom he made pro-vicar. The succeeding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Caspar Max, Freiherr von Droste-Vischering (1824-46), who, having been <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> since 1795, had confirmed many hundreds of thousands and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> over 2200 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. His administration was greatly hampered by the petty and far-reaching supervision of the Government. In place of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, suppressed in 1818, he was able to open, in 1832, an academy with <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculties; in 1902 this academy became a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Ecclesiastical life in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was in a somewhat unsatisfactory condition, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> being largely inclined to <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalistic</a> and <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">Hermesian</a> opinions.

<p>An <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and religious revival throughout <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> followed the events at Cologne in 1837 (see <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">COLOGNE</a>). This revival and the larger freedom granted the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> under King Frederick William IV produced excellent results in the diocese. During the episcopate of John Gregory M&uuml;ller (1847-70), fruitful popular missions were held in many places, many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> were rebuilt, and a large number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> and benevolent institutions were founded with the active assistance of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. His successor, John Bernhard Brinkmann (1870-89), laboured in the same apostolic spirit. During the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> he suffered fines, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, and, from 1875 to 1884, banishment. He was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to witness the destruction of much that had been established by his predecessors and by himself. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Hermann Dingelstadt, born 2 March, 1835, elected 15 August, 1889, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 24 February, 1890.
