<h1>Nagpur</h1>  

<p>(Nagpurensis)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, suffragan to Madras. Formerly the north-western portion of the Vicariate Apostolic of <a href="../cathen/15496a.htm">Vizagapatam</a>, it was erected into a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> on 29 July, 1887, and its boundaries finally readjusted on 10 July, 1895. It comprises the greater portion of the Central Provinces, Berar, a portion of the Indore State, a strip of the Nizam's dominions as far south as the Godavery River, etc., the boundaries being in many parts independent of civil divisions. The area is about 124,000 square miles with a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 15,000 out of total of about 15,000,000 inhabitants.

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Although the territories comprised under Nagpur were included within the Vicariate of the Great Mogul, there is no trace of any missionary ever having set foot there till the beginning of the nineteenth century. Nagpur, Kamptee, Aurangabad, and Jaulnah were first visited by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Goan <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, from <a href="../cathen/12235b.htm">Poona</a>, about 1814. A <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Anthony existed at Takli, suburb of Nagpur, where the troops of the Rajah of Nagpur were quartered. Another was built in Kamptee, and held in great veneration by native <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. A Goan <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> died at Nagpur in 1834. Simultaneously, Goan <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> established themselves at Aurangabad, and built a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> in 1816; another <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was built by them at Kannar, two miles from Aurangabad. Military cantonments for British troops were created at Kamptee in 1821, and at Jaulnah in 1827. The Goan <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> retained their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in these parts until 1839, when, in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Apostolic Brief</a> "Multa praeclare" of 24 April, 1838, the district fell to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>. In January, 1839, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a> took possession of Kamptee and Jaulnah. They were Fathers Breen (died 1844) and Egen at Kamptee, and D. Murphy at Jaulnah. Father Murphy, whose registers are preserved in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> residence at Nagpur, subsequently became <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Hyderabad and then <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07380c.htm">Hobart</a> Town, Tasmania, where he died in 1908. In 1845 some missionaries of St. Francis de Sales, from <a href="../cathen/01540a.htm">Annecy</a> (Savoy, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>), were appointed to the charge of the northern portion of the Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, which was thus separated and made into the Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/15496a.htm">Vizagapatam</a>. They took possession of Aurungabad, Jaulnah, and Kamptee in 1846, and visited Nagpur, Ellichpur (1848), Jubbulpur (1850), and Khandwa. Jubbulpur became a military cantonment in 1857. From 1846 to 1870 Nagpur was a sub-station of Kamptee, and then became a residential station. It developed into the headquarters of the mission when the district was finally separated from <a href="../cathen/15496a.htm">Vizagapatam</a> and made into an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, suffragan to <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a>, in 1887.
