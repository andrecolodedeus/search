<h1>Namur</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of Namur (Namurcensis), constituted by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 12 May, 1559, from territory previously belonging to the Diocese of Liege, and made suffragan of the new <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a> re-established a Diocese of Namur, its limits to coincide with those of the Department of Sambre-et-Meuse, and to be suffragan of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>. On 14 Sept., 1823, the Diocese of Namur was increased by the territory of <a href="../cathen/09465a.htm">Luxemburg</a>, which had formerly belonged to the <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Diocese of Metz</a>, and which, forming, under the First Empire, part of the Departments of the For&ecirc;ts and the Ardennes, had been given, in 1815, to the Kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. After the Revolution of 1830, which brought about the separation between the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg and the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Province of Luxemburg, the City of Luxemburg, received a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. In 1840 the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of this vicar was extended to the whole grand duchy. On 7 October, 1842, the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Diocese of Namur was definitively restricted to the two <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Provinces of Namur and Luxemburg.

<p>In 1047, Albert II, Count of Namur, caused the erection, on the site of an ancient <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, which an unauthenticated legend says was dedicated by Pope Cornlius in the third century, of a collegiate church, served by twelve canons, who had the right of administering <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> within their lands. The first dean, Frederick of Lorraine, brother-in-law of Albert II, about 1050 secured from the chapter of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> a portion of the head of St. Aubain, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. The collegiate church took the name of St. Aubain the Martyr. In 1057 Frederick became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the name of <a href="../cathen/14290c.htm">Stephen IX</a>. The various successors of Albert II enriched this foundation with numerous privileges. In 1209 <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, took it under his protection. In 1263 Baldwin, Emperor of Constantinople, heir of the counts of Namur, sold the countship to Guy de Dampierre, Count of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, and the House of Dampierre also protected the collegiate church. In 1429 Count John III sold the countship to Philip the Good, Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. Thenceforth, until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, Namur belonged to the House of Burgundy-Austria, except during the years 1692-95, when it was occupied by <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>. Charles the Bold, <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>, <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, Albert and Isabella all <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">knelt</a> and took the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> in the sanctuary of St. Aubain. This church thus held a most important place in the political life of the country. It was rebuilt in the eighteenth century after the model of St. Peter's at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Don John of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> is buried there.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Namur resisted Josephinism. In 1789, despite the formal prohibition of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, the image of the Blessed Virgin was carried in processions through the streets in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Immaculate Conception. Under the Directory, the <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a>, Stevens, formerly a professor in the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, and famous for his opposition to Josephinism, directed the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> by mysteriously circulated communications issued from his hiding-place at Fleurus. After the Concordat, when the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchman</a> Leopold-Glaude de Bexon had been made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Namur, Stevens feared that the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> would be too compliant towards <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>. The pamphlets which he circulated under the title "Sophisme d&eacute; voil&eacute;" advised the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to refuse adhesion to the Concordat, as it would be taken by the State for adhesion to the <a href="../cathen/01756a.htm">Organic Articles</a>. A <em>petite &eacute;glise</em> formed of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> calling themselves "Stevenists" was formed in the diocese. It was strengthened by the subservience of Bishop Bexon, whom age had weakened, for the prefect P&eacute;res and by the circular (13 November, 1802) in which he denied having disapproved of the <a href="../cathen/01756a.htm">Organic Articles</a>. At last Bexon resigned, 15 Sept., 1803, and was succeeded by Pisani de la Gaude. But Stevenism continued to exist. Stevens admitted that the Concordat was legitimate, and that the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> might be received; he only protested against the formula of adhesion to the Concordat. But the Stevenists went farther: they held that the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was radically defective, and they would recognize no other spiritual head than Stevens. The <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> lasted until 1814, when Pisani de la Gaude accepted the declaration recognizing the legitimate <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> which the Stevenists were willing to make. Stevens died on 5 September, 1828. He had submitted all his writings to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, which never passed judgment. Since 1866 the right of appointing the dean and chapter of Namur has been reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="../cathen/04665b.htm">Dechamps</a>, later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Namur from 1865 to 1867.

<p>Two <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> in the Diocese of Namur had great renown during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>: the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Brogne, founded by <a href="../cathen/06465b.htm">St. G&eacute;rard</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06105b.htm">Premonstratensian Abbey of Floreffe</a>. In 1819 a preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was installed at <a href="../cathen/06105b.htm">Floreffe</a>, which was suppressed by the Government in 1825 and re-established in 1830. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Gemblours, founded in 922 by Guibert de Darnau, acquired great renown in the twelfth century. Sigebert and Gottschalk wrote there an important chronicle. Ravaged by the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> in 1578, and by fire in 1712, the Abbey of Gemblours was suppressed in 1793. The Abbey of Waulsort was founded in 946 for Scotch (Irish) <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> under <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Benedictine rule</a>. Its first two <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were St. Maccelan and St. Cadroes; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> St. Forannan (d. 980) was also <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Waulsort. In 1131 <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the main altar of the church of the Abbey of G&eacute;ronsart, administered by the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular of St. Augustine</a>. The buildings of the Abbey of Paix Notre-Dame, founded in 1613 by the Reformed <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, have since 1831 sheltered a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. The Assumptionist fathers have a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Bure. A very important centre of studies was founded at Maredsous in 1872 by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>; it was erected into an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in 1878, and in 1888 provided with a beautiful <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a>. The "Revue B&eacute;n&eacute;dictine" and the "Analecta Maredsol&acirc;na" have already assured the fame of this <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was Placide Wolter, who in 1890 became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Beuron; the second was Hildebrand de Hemptinne, who, in 1893, became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>. In 1907 there were in the community of Maredsous 140 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, 64 of whom were <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. A college for higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and a technical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> are connected with the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. At Maredret, near Maredsous, waa established in 1893 the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> abbey of St. Scholastica, which in 1907 numbered 41 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>.

<p>The Diocese of Namur honours with special veneration Sts. Maiternus, Servatus (Servais), and Remaculus, the first apostles of the Diocese of Tongres, which later became that of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Liege</a>, and some <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the Diocese of Liege, Sts. Lambert, Hubert, and Juliana. Mention may also be made of <a href="../cathen/06123c.htm">St. Foillan</a>) of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> origin, founder, in 650, of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Fosses; St. Begge, sister of <a href="../cathen/06533c.htm">St. Gertrude of Nivelles</a>, and foundress, in 692, of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Andenne, where her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are preserved; St. Hadelin, founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Celles, d. about 690; St. Walhere, or Vohy, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Onhay (thirteenth century); St. Mary of Oignies, b. at Nivelles about 1177, celebrated for her visions, d. at the b&eacute;guinage of Oignies, where her director, Jacques de Vitry, who became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of St. Jean d'Acre and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, wished also to be buried. Lastly, the Diocese of Namur honours in a special manner the <a href="../cathen/06651c.htm">Martyrs of Gorkum</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> it possesses. At Arlon, which now belongs to the diocese, was born Henri Busch, famous as "Bon Henri", founder of the shoemakers' and the tailors' fraternities in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (seventeenth century).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> congregations administer in the Diocese of Namur, according to "La Belgique Charitable", 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for boys, 7 for girls, 1 mixed, 18 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or infirmaries, 4 clinics, 194 infant <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, 1 house of rescue, 6 houses for the care of the sick in their homes, 1 asylum for deaf mutes, 2 houses of retreat, l insane asylum. In 1907 the Diocese of Namur numbered 583,722 inhabitants, 36 deaneries, 37 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 677 succursals, 96 auxiliary <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 111 curacies paid by the State.
