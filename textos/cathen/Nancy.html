<p>DIOCESE OF NANCY (NANCEIENISIS ET TULLENSIS).

<p>Comprises the Departments of Meurthe and Moselle, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>. The See of Nancy is the heir, so to speak, of the celebrated See of Toul.

<p>St. Mansuetus, Apostle of the Leuci and first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toul, and according to some a disciple of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a>, cannot have been anterior to the fourth century. The dates of his saintly successors, Amondus, Alchas, and Celsinus, cannot be determined. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Toul should be mentioned: St. Auspicius (about 470); <a href="../cathen/15230a.htm">St. Ursus</a> (Ours), from whom <a href="../cathen/04070a.htm">Clovis</a> in 496 requested an ecclesiastic to instruct him in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">teaching of Christianity</a>; St. Epvre (Aper) (500-505), brother of St. Evronie (Apronia); St. Alband (about 508), established a community of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> from which originated the Abbey of St. Epvre; St. Leudinus-Bodo (second half of the seventh century), founder of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Bon Moustiers and brother of St. Salaberge, foundress and first <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Laon; St. Jacob (756-65); St. Gauzelin (922-62), who reformed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Epvre and founded that of Notre-Dame de Bouxi&egrave;res; St. Gerard (963-94); Bruno of Dagsbourg (1026-51), eventually <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">St. Leo IX</a>; Guillaume Fill&acirc;tre (1449-60) Cardinal John of Lorraine (1517-43), who held twelve sees and six large <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>; Charles of Lorraine, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> of Vaudemont (1580-87); Cardinal Nicholas Fran&ccedil;ois of Lorraine (1625-34); Andr&eacute; du Saussay (1649-75), author of "Martyrologium Gallicanum".

<p>The title of count and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Bishops of Toul originated in certain grants which Henry the Fowler gave St. Gauzelin in 927. The See of Toul was disturbed by the <a href="../cathen/08084c.htm">Conflict of Investitures</a> in 1108. The chapter was divided; the majority elected Riquin of Commercy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; the minority chose Conrad of Schwarzenburg. Henry V declared for the latter; <a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">Pascal II</a> for the former, but nevertheless he granted Conrad the title of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, provided he performed no episcopal office. In 1271 grave differences broke out again in the chapter of Toul; after seven years' vacancy the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> rescinded the four elections made by the chapter, and in 1278 <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> personally appointed as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Conrad of T&uuml;bingen. Thenceforth it was generally the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> which appointed the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, alleging various reasons as the vacancies arose, hence the many <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who held this important see until 1552, when Toul was occupied by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1597 Charles III, duke of <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, impatient of his dependence on a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> henceforth French, asked <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> for the dismemberment of the See of Toul and the creation of a see at Nancy; this failed through the opposition of Arnaud d'Ossat, Henry's ambassador at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, however, decided that Nancy was to have a <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> church and that its <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> would have the title of <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> of Lorraine and wear episcopal insignia, but should not exercise episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>.

<p>In 1777 and 1778 Toul lost territories out of which were formed two new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>: Saint-Di&eacute; and Nancy, both of them suffragans of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. The Concordat of 1802, which suppressed Toul, made Nancy the seat of a vast diocese which included the three Departments of Meurthe, Meuse, and Vosges; the latter two were detached from Nancy in 1822 on the re-establishment of the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a> and <a href="../cathen/13344b.htm">Saint-Di&eacute;</a>. When <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> lost Alsace-Lorraine in 1871, Nancy lost the arrondissements of Sarrebourg and Ch&acirc;teau-Salins which, having become German, were united with the <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Diocese of Metz</a>. Nancy however annexed the arrondissement of Briey which remained French, and was detached from the <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Diocese of Metz</a> (consistorial decrees of 10 and 14 July, 1874). Since 1824 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Nancy have borne the title of Bishops of Nancy and Toul, as the ancient Diocese of Toul is almost entirely united with Nancy. It has had some illustrious <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: Forbin-Janson (1824-44); <a href="../cathen/04634b.htm">Darboy</a> (1859-63); the future <a href="../cathen/09050d.htm">Cardinal Lavigerie</a> (1863-67); and the future Cardinal Foulon (1867-82). Since 1165, whenever the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Toul officiated pontifically, he wore an ornament called <em>surhumeral</em>, or <em>rationale</em>, a sort of <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> covered with precious stones, which decoration he alone of all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> wore. A brief of 16 March, 1865, restored this privilege to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Nancy and Toul. Concerning the insinuations of the <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a> in 1870 &agrave;propos of this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, see <a href="../cathen/06725a.htm">Granderath</a>, "Geschichte des Vatikanischen Konzils", II, 589, and III, 748. St. Sigisbert, III (630-54), King of Austrasia, and founder of twelve <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, is patron of the City of Nancy.

<p>On 5 Dec., 1572, <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> signed the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> for the erection of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at Pont-&agrave;-Mousson; the faculties of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and arts were entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; the learned <a href="../cathen/14027c.htm">Father Sirmond</a> made his profession there, and in 1581 <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Queen Mary Stuart</a> established a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for twenty-four Scotsmen and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irishmen</a>. <a href="../cathen/11767b.htm">St. Peter Fourier</a> was a pupil of this <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. <a href="../cathen/10048a.htm">Cardinal Mathieu</a> (d. 1908) was for many years <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Pont-&agrave;-Mousson. The congregation of Our Lady of Refuge was founded at Nancy for penitent <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in 1627, by Elizabeth of Ranfaing, known as sister Mary Elizabeth of the Cross of Jesus. This congregation had numerous houses throughout <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Mattaincourt, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of <a href="../cathen/11767b.htm">St. Peter Fourier</a>, belonged to Toul when the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> established his important foundations in the seventeenth century.

<p>The chief <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> centres are: Notre-Dame de Bon Secours, at Nancy, dating from the fifteenth century, and for which King Stanislaus built (1738-41) a large sanctuary on the site of the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> erected by King Ren&eacute;; Notre-Dame do Sion, at Saxe-Sion, dating from the episcopate of St. Gerard, and whose madonna, broken during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, was replaces in 1802 by another (<a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>) <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>; and St-Nicolas du Port, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">St. Nicholas, Bishop of Myra</a>, <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of Lorraine.

<p>Prior to the enforcement of the Associations Law of 1901, there were in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/11184b.htm">Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>, <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, and several orders of teaching brothers, one of which, the Brothers of the Christian Doctrine (founded in 1822) by Dom Fr&eacute;chard, former <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> of Senones Abbey), had its mother-house at Nancy.

<p>Orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canonesses Regular of St. Augustine</a> of the Congregation of Notre Dame, a teaching order founded at Vezelise in 1629, and transferred to Lun&eacute;ville in 1850; Sisters of St. Charles, a nursing and teaching order, the foundation of which in 1651 was due to the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of two <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, Joseph and Emmanuel Chauvenal; Sisters of the Christian Doctrine, called Vatelottes, a nursing and teaching order founded about 1718 by the Duke of Lorraine and Father Jean-Baptiste Vatelot; Sisters of the Holy Childhood of Mary, a nursing and teaching order which Canon Claude Daunot took thirty-five years to establish (1820-55); Sisters of the Holy Heart of Mary, a teaching order founded in 1842 by Bishop Manjaud and Countess Clara de Gondrecourt; Daughters of Compassion, a nursing order of <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a> tertiaries, established in 1854 by Abb&eacute; Thiriet at St-Firmin.

<p>The religious congregations of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> conduct 6 <em>cr&egrave;ches</em>, 57 day-nurseries, 2 institutions for sick children, 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the blind, 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for deaf-mutes, 3 boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 23 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 12 sewing rooms (industrial), 3 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for apprentices, 32 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or asylums, 17 houses for visiting nurses, 16 houses of retreat, 1 insane asylum. In 1909, the Diocese of Nancy had 517,508 inhabitants, 29 deaneries, 482 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 91 vicariates.
