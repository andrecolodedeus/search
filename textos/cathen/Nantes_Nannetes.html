<h1>Nantes (Nannetes)</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of Nantes (Nanceiensis).

<p>This <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which comprises the entire department of Loire Inf&eacute;rieure, was re-established by the Concordat of 1802, and is suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>. According to late traditions, St. Clarus, first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nantes, was a disciple of St. Peter. De la Borderie, however, has shown that the ritual of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Nantes, drawn up by <a href="../cathen/12372a.htm">precentor</a> Helius in 1263, ignores the apostolic mission of St. Clarus; that St. Peter's nail in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Nantes was not brought thither by St. Clarus, but at a time subsequent to the invasions of the <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Northmen</a> in the tenth century; that St. Flix of Nantes, writing with six other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in 567 to St. Radegond, attribute to St. Martin the chief r&ocirc;le in the conversion of the Nantais to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; that the traditions concerning the mission of St. Clarus are later than 1400. The earliest list of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Nantes (made, according to Duchesne, at the beginning of the tenth century) does not favour the thesis of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Nantes prior to Constantine. The author of the Passion of the Nantes <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, Sts. Donatian and Rogatian, places their death in the reign of Constantius Chlorus, and seems to believe that Rogatian could not be baptized, because the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was absent. Duchesne believes that the two <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> suffered at an earlier date, and disputes the inference of the ancient writer concerning the absence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He believes that the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Nantes, whose date is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, is Desiderius (453), correspondent of Sulpicius Severus and <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">St. Paulinus of Nola</a>. Several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, occupied the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> before him, among others St. Clarus and St. Similianus, but their dates are uncertain. Mgr Duchesne considers as legendary the St. &AElig;milianus supposed to have been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nantes in Charlemagnes reign and to have fought the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> in <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>.

<p>Among the noteworthy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are: St. Felix (550-83), whose municipal improvements at Nantes were praised in the poems of <a href="../cathen/06149a.htm">Fortunatus</a>, and who often mediated between the people of Brittany and the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kings; St. Pacharius (end of seventh century); St. Gohard (Gohardus), <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11115b.htm">Northmen</a> in 843, with the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Aindre; Actardus (843-71), during whose time the Breton prince Nomeno&eacute;, in his conflict with the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, created a see at Gu&eacute;rande, in favour of an ecclesiastic of <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a>, in the heart of the Diocse of Nantes; the preacher Cospeau (1621-36). The diocese venerates: the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> St. Herv&eacute; (sixth century); the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> Sts. Friard and Secondel of Besn&eacute; (sixth century); St. Victor, <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> at Cambon (sixth or seventh century); the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> Vital, or St. Viaud (seventh or eighth century); the Greek St. Beno&icirc;t, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Masserac in <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne's</a> time; St. Martin of Vertou (d. 601), apostle of the Herbauges district and founder of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Vertou; St. Hermeland, sent by <a href="../cathen/08757a.htm">St. Lambert</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Fontenelle, at the end of the seventh century to found on an island in the Loire the great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Aindre (now Indret); the celebrated missionary St. Amand, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maastricht (seventh century), a native of the district of Herbauges. Blessed Franoise d'Ambroise (1427-85), who became Duchess of Brittany in 1450, had a great share in the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of St. Vincent Ferrier, rebuilt the choir of the collegiate church of Notre-Dame, and founded at Nantes the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>. Widowed in 1457, she resisted the intrigues of Louis XI, who urged her to contract a second marriage, and in 1468 became a <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> at <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a>. In 1477, at the request of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, she restored the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Cou&euml;ts, near Nantes. The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a> was a native of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The Abbey of La Meilleraye, founded in 1132, was the beginning of an establishment of <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappist</a> Fathers, who played a most important part in the agricultural development of the country. The <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a> were preached at Nantes by <a href="../cathen/13096a.htm">Blessed Robert of Arbrissel</a>, founder of Fontevrault. Venerable Charles of <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a> won Nantes from his rival Jean de Montfort in 1341. On 8 August, 1499, Louis XII married Anne of Brittany at Nantes &#151; a marriage which later led to the annexation of the Duchy of Brittany to the Crown of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1532). Chateaubriant, a town of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> centre in the sixteenth century. For the Edict of Nantes (1595), which granted <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> religious freedom and certain political prerogatives, see <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">HUGUENOTS</a>.

<p>In 1665, by order of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, <a href="../cathen/12797a.htm">Cardinal Retz</a> was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the castle of Nantes, from which he contrived to escape. A college was created at Nantes in 1680 for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. Certain regions of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> were, during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, the scene of the War of La Vend&eacute;e, waged in defence of religious freedom and to restore royalty. At Savenay in December, 1793, succumbed the remains of the Vendean army, already defeated in the battle of Cholet. The atrocities committed at Nantes by the terrorist Carrier are well-known. Four councils were held at Nantes, in 600, 1127, 1264, and 1431. The mausoleum of Francis II, last Duke of Brittany, executed in 1507 by Michel Colomb, is one of the finest monuments of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. The chief places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: Notre-Dame de Bon Garant at Orvault, a very old <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, repeatedly made by Francis II, Duke of Brittany; Notre-Dame de Bon Secours at Nantes, a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> centre which dates back to the fourteenth century ; Notre-Dame de Toutes Aides. Notre-Dame de Mis&eacute;ricorde became a place of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> in 1026 in memory of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> by which the country is said to have been freed from a dragon; the present seat of the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> is the Church of St. Similien at Nantes. Before the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1901 against congregations, the diocese counted <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Missionary Priests of Mary, Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Missionaires of Africa, <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>, <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, and several orders of teaching brothers. The <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> of Nantes were established by <a href="../cathen/08481a.htm">St. Angela of Merici</a> in 1640.

<p>Among the congregations for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> originating in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: the Sisters of Christian Instruction, a teaching order founded in 1820 at Beignon (<a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Diocese of Vannes</a>) by Abb&eacute; Deshayes, of which the mother-house was transferred to St-Gildas des Bois in 1828; Sisters of the Immaculate Conception, a teaching and nursing order, founded in 1853 (mother-house at La Haye Mah&eacute;as) ; <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters, founded in 1871 (mother-house at St-Philbert de Grandlieu); Oblate <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters of the Heart of Jesus, founded in 1875 by Mlle Gazeau de la Brandanniere (mother-house at Nantes). At the beginning of the twentieth century, the religious congregations of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> conducted three creches, 44 day nurseries, 3 homes for sick children, 1 institution for the blind, 1 deaf and dumb institution, 6 boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 17 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 3 homes for poor girls, 1 institution for the extinction of mendicity, 2 houses of mercy, 1 house to supply work to the unemployed, 1 vestiary, 10 houses of visiting nurses, 7 homes for invalids and for retirement, 23 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or asylums. The Diocese of Nantes has 664,971 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 52 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 209 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>.
