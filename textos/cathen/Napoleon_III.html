<h1>Napoleon III</h1>  

<p>(Charles-Louis-Napol&eacute;on).

<p>Originally known as Louis-Napol&eacute;on-Bonaparte, Emperor of the French; b. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 20 April, 1808; d. at Chiselhurst, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 6 January, 1873; third son of Louis Bonaparte, King of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and Hortense de Beauharnais, daughter of the Empress Josephine.

<p>After the fall of the First Empire, Hortense, who had been separated from her husband, took her two sons to Geneva, Aix in <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, and then (1824) to the castle of Arenenberg in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. Louis Napoleon had for tutor the scholar Le Bas, son of a member of the Convention. The "principle of nationalities" attracted him in youth, and with his brother, he took part in an attempted insurrection in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>, in 1831. He was on the point of setting out for <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> when he heard that the Russians had entered Warsaw. On the death of the Duke of Reichstadt (1832) he regarded himself as the heir of the Napoleonic Empire. The Republican press, engaged in a struggle with Louis Philippe's government, manifested a certain sympathy for Louis Napoleon. Though Casimir P&eacute;rier had expelled him from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1831, he and a few officers from <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> attempted, but failed in, a <em>coup de main</em> (1836). In his book, "Id&eacute;es Napol&eacute;oniennes", published in 1838, he appears as the testamentary executor of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon I</a> and a bold social reformer. His attempted descent on Boulogne, in August, 1840, resulted in a sentence of life <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, notwithstanding his defence by <a href="../cathen/02517a.htm">Berryer</a>. While in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> at Ham, he wrote, among other brochures, one on the "Extinction of Pauperism". He escaped from Ham in 1846. After the Revolution of 1848 he returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, became a member of the Constituent Assembly, and finally was elected President of the Republic by 5,562,834 votes, on 10 December, 1848.
<h2>Presidency of Louis Napoleon</h2>

<p>Before his election Louis Napoleon had entered into certain engagements with <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a> in regard to freedom of teaching and the restoration of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, who had been driven to <a href="../cathen/06333a.htm">Gaeta</a> by the Roman Revolution. When General Oudinot's expedition made its direct attack on the Roman Republic, April, 1849, and the Constituent Assembly passed a resolution of protest (7 May, 1849), a letter from Louis Napoleon to Oudinot requested him to persist in his enterprise and assured him of reinforcements (8 May, 1849); at the same time, however, Louis Napoleon sent Ferdinand de Lesseps to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to negotiate with Mazzini, an agreement soon after disavowed. In this way the difficulties of the future emperor reveal themselves from the beginning; he wished to spare the religious susceptibilities of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and to avoid offending the national susceptibilities of the Italian revolutionists &#151; a double aim which explains many an inconsistency and many a failure in the religious policy of the empire. "The more we study his character, the more nonplussed we are", writes his historian, de la Gorce. Oudinot's victory (29 June, 1849) having crushed the Roman Republic, Napoleon, ignoring the decided <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> majority in the Legislative Assembly elected on 18 May, addressed to Colonel Ney, on 18 August, 1849, a sort of manifesto in which he asked of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> a general amnesty, the secularization of his administration, the establishment of the Code Napol&eacute;on, and a Liberal Government. The Legislative Assembly, on <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert's</a> motion, voted approval of the "Motu Proprio" of 12 September, by which <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> promised reforms without yielding to all the president's imperative demands. The president was dissatisfied, and forced the Falloux Cabinet to resign; but he was soon working with all the influence of his position for the passage of the Falloux Law on freedom of teaching &#151; a law which involved a great triumph for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> &#151; while, in the course of his journeys through <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, his deferential treatment of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was extremely marked. And when, by the <em>Coup d'Etat</em> of 2 December, 1851, Louis Napoleon had dissolved the Assembly, and by the <em>pl&eacute;biscite</em> appealed to the French people as to the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of that act, many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, following <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a> and <a href="../cathen/15394b.htm">Louis Veuillot</a>, decided in his favour; the prince-president obtained 7,481,231 votes (21 November, 1852). The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/12667b.htm">Ravignan</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05202a.htm">Bishop Dupanloup</a> were more reserved in their attitude. <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a> went so far as to say: "If <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> becomes accustomed to this order of things, we are moving rapidly towards the Lower Empire".
<h2>Dictatorial period of the empire, 1852-60</h2>

<p>The first acts of the new government were decidedly favourable to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. By the "Decree Law" of 31 January, 1852, the congregations of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, which previously could be authorized only by a legislative act, were made authorizable by simple decrees. A great many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> hailed with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> the day on which Louis Napoleon was proclaimed emperor and the day (30 January, 1853) of his marriage with the Spanish Eug&eacute;nie de Montijo, which seemed to assure the future of the dynasty. At this very time <a href="../cathen/05202a.htm">Dupanloup</a>, less optimistic, published a pastoral letter on the liberty of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, while <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a> began to perceive symptoms which made him fear that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would not always have reason to congratulate itself on the new order. For some years the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> enjoyed effective liberty: the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> held <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> at their pleasure; the budget of public worship was forthcoming; <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> sat in the Senate as of right; the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> appeared in religious processions; missions were given; from 1852-60 the State recognized 982 new communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; primary and secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> under <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> control increased in number, while, in 1852, P&eacute;res Petetot and <a href="../cathen/06731b.htm">Gratry</a> founded the Oratory as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> centre of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> like <a href="../cathen/13686a.htm">S&eacute;gur</a>, Cornudet, Baudon, <a href="../cathen/04078a.htm">Cochin</a>, and the Vicomte de Melun founded many <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> under state protection. Napoleon III was anxious that <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> should consent to come to crown him at Notre Dame. This request he caused to be preferred by <a href="../cathen/13686a.htm">Mgr de S&eacute;gur</a>, auditor of the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> explained that, if he <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Napoleon III, he would also be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to go and crown Francis Joseph of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, hinting, at the same time, that Napoleon could come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; and he gave it to be understood that, if the emperor were willing to suppress the <a href="../cathen/01756a.htm">Organic Articles</a>, he, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, might be able to accede to his request at the end of three months. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> also wished Napoleon III to make the Sunday rest <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> and abrogate the legal necessity of <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">civil marriage</a> previous to the religious <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. After two years of negotiations the emperor gave up this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> (1854), but thereafter his relations with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> seemed to be somewhat less cordial. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> in which <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> defined the Immaculate Conception was admitted into <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> grudgingly, and after some very lively opposition on the part of the Council of State (1854). Dreux Br&eacute;z&eacute;, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10603b.htm">Moulins</a>, was denounced to the Council of State for infringement of the <a href="../cathen/01756a.htm">Organic Articles</a>, while the "Correspondant" and the "Univers", having defended the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, were rigorously dealt with by the authorities. Lastly, the return to the <em>Cour de Cassation</em> (Court of Appeals) of the former <em>procureur g&eacute;n&eacute;ral</em> Dupin, who had resigned in 1852, was looked upon as a victory for Gallican <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>.



<p>The Crimean War (1853-56) was undertaken by Napoleon, in alliance with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, to check Russian aggression in the direction of <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkey</a>. The Fall of Sebastopol (8 September, 1855) compelled Alexander II to sign the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1856). In this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, thanks to its minister, Cavour, had had a part, both military and diplomatic; for the first time <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> was treated as one of the Great Powers. After all, the Italian Question interested the emperor more than any other, and upon this ground difficulties were about to arise between him and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. As early as 1856 Napoleon <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, through Cavour, that the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> programme involved the dismemberment of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>; at the promptings of the French Government the Congress of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> expressed a wish that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should carry out liberal reforms, and that the French and Austrian troops should soon leave his territories. The attempt on the emperor's life by the Italian Orsini (14 January, 1858), set in motion a policy of severe repression ("Law of General Security" and proceedings against Proudhon, the socialist). But the letter which Orsini wrote from his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> to Napoleon, beseeching him to give liberty to twenty-five million <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, made a lively impression upon the emperor's <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. Pietri, the prefect of police obtained from Orsini another letter, pledging his political friends to renounce all violent methods, with the understanding that the enfranchisement of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was the price to be paid for this assurance. From that time, it was Napoleon's active wish to realize Italian unity. On 21 July, 1858, he had an interview with Cavour at Plombi&eacute;res. It was agreed between them that <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> should drive the Austrians from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> should become a confederation, under the rule of the King of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, though the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was to be its honorary president. The result of this interview was the Italian War. For this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> public opinion had been schooled by a series of articles in Liberal and government organs &#151; the "Si&eacute;cle", "Presse", and "Patrie" &#151; by Edmond About's articles on the pontifical administration, published in the "Moniteur", and by the anonymous brochure "L'Empereur Napol&eacute;on III et l'Italie" (really the work of Arthur de la Gu&eacute;ronni&eacute;re), which denounced the spirit of opposition to reform shown by the italian governments. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> tried to obtain Napoleon's assurance that he would not aid the enemies of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. In the House of Representatives (Corps L&eacute;gislatif) the Republican Jules Favre asked: "If the government of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> is overthrown shall we shed the blood of the Romans to restore it?" And the minister, Baroche, made no answer (26 April, 1859). But Napoleon, in the proclamation announcing his departure for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (10 May, 1859), declared that he was going to deliver <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> as far as the Adriatic, and that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> power would remain intact. The victories of the French troops at Magenta (4 June. 1859) and Solferino (24 June, 1859) coincided with insurrectionary movements against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were alarmed, and so was the emperor; he would not appear as an accomplice of these movements, and on 11 July he signed the treaty of Villafranca. <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> ceded <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> retroceded it to <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>. Venetia was still to belong to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, but would form part of the Italian Confederation which would be under the honorary presidency of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> would be asked to introduce the indispensable reforms in his state. In November, 1859, at <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, these preliminaries were formally embodied in a treaty.

<p>Neither the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> nor the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> were pleased with the emperor. On the one hand the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did not thank Napoleon for his hints on the way to govern the Romagna, and an eloquent brochure from the pen of <a href="../cathen/05202a.htm">Dupanloup</a> denounced the schemes which menaced the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. On the other hand it was plain to the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> that the emperor had halted before enfranchising <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> as far as the Adriatic. Napoleon then dreamed of settling the affairs of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> by means of a congress, and Arthur de la Gu&eacute;ronni&eacute;re's pamphlet, "Le pape et le congr&eacute;s", demanded of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, in advance, the surrender of his temporal power. On 1 January, 1860, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> denounced this pamphlet as a "monument of hypocrisy", and on 9 January he answered with a formal refusal a letter from Napoleon advising him to give up the Legations. A few months later, the Legations themselves joined <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, while Napoleon, by making Thouvenel his minister of foreign affairs and by negotiating with Cavour the annexation of <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Nice</a> and <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that he was decidedly more devoted to the aspirations of <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> than to the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> commenced violent press campaigns under the leadership of the "Univers" and the "Correspondant". On 24 January, 1869, the "Univers" was suppressed. The minister of state, Billaut, prosecuted the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> publications and <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> utterances deemed seditious. To be sure Baroche, on 2 April, announced in the Corps L&eacute;gislatif, that the French troops would not leave <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> so long as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was unable to defend himself. But Napoleon, only too anxious to withdraw his troops, at one moment thought of having them replaced by <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> troops, and then proposed to <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, though in vain, that the Powers of the second order should be induced to organize a body of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> troops, to be paid by all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> states jointly. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, on the other hand, allowed Mgr de M&eacute;rode to make an appeal to the aristocracy of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> for the formation of a special corps of pontifical troops, which should enable the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to do without the emperor's soldiers. Among these soldiers of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> were a large number of French Legitimists; Lamerici&eacute;re, their commander, had always been a foe of the imperial regime. Napoleon III was annoyed, and ordered his ambassador at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to enter into negotiations for the withdrawal of the French troops: on 11 May, 1860, it was decided that within three months the soldiers given to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by Napoleon III should return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>In the meantime, however, Garibaldi's campaign in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and Calabria opened. Farini and Cialdini, sent by Cavour to Napoleon, represented to him (28 August) the urgent necessity of checking the Italian revolution, that Garibaldi was about to march on <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> ought to leave to <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> the task of preserving order in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, for which purpose the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> must be allowed to cross the pontifical territories so as to reach the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> frontier. "Faites vite (act quickly)", said the emperor, and himself left <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, travelling in <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a> and Algeria, while the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> troops invaded Umbria and the Marches, defeated the troops of Lamorici&eacute;re at Castelfidardo, captured <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, and occupied all the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a> except <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the province of <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>. Napoleon publicly warned Victor Emmanuel that, if he attacked the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> without legitimate provocation, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> would be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to oppose him; he withdrew his minister from <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, leaving instead only a charg&eacute; d'affaires, and was a mere spectator of that series of events which, in February, 1861, ended in Victor Emmanuel's being proclaimed King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The expedition to <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> (1859), in which 80,000 French troops went to the relief of the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite Christians</a>, who were being massacred by the Druses with the connivance of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, the two expeditions to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> (1857 and 1860), in co-operation with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, which resulted, among other things, in the restoration to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of their religious establishments, and the joint expedition of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (1858-62) against the Annamese Empire, which avenged the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> on Annam and ended in the conquest of Cochin China by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, merited for the armies of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the gratitude of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Still the attitude of Napoleon III in regard to Italian affairs caused great pain to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Falloux in an article entitled "Ant&eacute;c&eacute;dents et cons&eacute;quences de la situation actuelle", published in the "Correspondant", implied that Napoleon was an accomplice in the Italian revolution. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> associations formed to collect subscriptions for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> benefit were suppressed, and <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, in the consistorial allocution of 17 December, 1860, accused the emperor of having "feigned" to protect him.
<h2>Liberal period of the empire, 1860-70</h2>

<p>It was just at this time that the emperor, by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 24 November, 1860, made his first concession to the Opposition, and to Liberal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, by granting more independence and power of initiative to the Legislature. But the Liberal opposition was not disarmed, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> discontent was aggravated by his Italian policy, The emperor replied to <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> by publishing la Gu&eacute;ronni&eacute;re's book, "La France, Rome et l'Italie", a violent arraignment of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Then Bishop Pie of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> published his pastoral charge in which the words, "Lavetes mains, O Pilate" (Wash thy hands, O <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>), were addressed to Napoleon III. In the Senate, an amendment in favour of the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was lost by only a very small majority; in the Corps L&eacute;gislatif, one-third of the deputies declared themselves for the pontifical cause. The emperor asserted his Italian sympathies more and more clearly: in June, 1862, he recognized the new kingdom; he sent an ambassador to <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> two partisans of Italian unity; and he used his influence with <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> to procure their recognition of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>. One striking symptom of the emperor's changed feelings towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was the circular of January, 1862, by which Persigny declared all the <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> dissolved. Following upon Garibaldi's blow at the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>, which had been stopped by his defeat at Aspramonte (29 August, 1862), General Durando, minister of foreign affairs in Ratazzi's cabinet, declared in a circular that "the whole Italian nation demanded its capital". Thus were the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> proclaiming their eagerness to be installed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Fearing that at the forthcoming legislative elections the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> would revolt from the imperial party, Napoleon suddenly manifested a much colder feeling for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> influence of the empress gained the upper hand of Prince Napoleon's anti-religious influence. Thouvenel was supplanted by Drouin* de Lhuys (15 October, 1862), who was made to give out a curt statement that the French Government had no present intention of taking any action in consequence of the Durando circular, thus bringing about the fall of the Ratazzi cabinet in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. A great many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> recovered their confidence in Napoleon; but a political alliance between a certain number of Liberal <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, devoted to the Royalist cause and members of the Republican party resulted, in June, 1863, in the return of thirty-five Opposition members to the Chamber, mostly men of great ability. Republicans and Monarchists, <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">Freethinkers</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, they grouped themselves around <a href="../cathen/14635b.htm">Thiers</a>, who had been Louis Philippe's minister, and who won the confidence of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by pronouncing unequivocally in favour of the temporal power, But the alliance between Republicans who wanted Napoleon to desist from protecting the temporal power and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who thought he did not protect it enough, could not be very stable. From 1862 to 1864 the emperor did nothing in regard to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> that could cause Pius IX any uneasiness. He was at that period busy with the early stages of the Mexican War, in which he had very imprudently allowed himself to become involved. Four years of fighting against President Juarez were destined to end in the evacuation of Mexico by the French troops, early in 1867, and the execution of Maximilian, brother of the Emperor of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had caused to be proclaimed Emperor of Mexico. The impression created by this disaster notably increased the strength of the Opposition in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>Negotiations between Napoleon III and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> recommenced in 1864, the Italian Government beseeching the emperor to put an end to the French occupation of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>. The Convention of 15 September, 1864, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to refrain from attacking the actual possessions of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and, on the contrary, to defend them, while <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> promised to withdraw her troops within a period of not more than two years, <em>pari passu</em>, with the organization of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> army. This arrangement caused profound sorrow at the Vatican; <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> drew the conclusion that Napoleon was preparing to leave the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a> at the mercy of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>. The diplomatic remonstrances with which the emperors government replied to the Syllabus, its prohibition against the circulation of that document, and Duruy's project to organize primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> without the concurrence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, were causes of dissatisfaction to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The speech of <a href="../cathen/14635b.htm">Thiers</a> against Italian unity, denouncing the imprudence of the Imperial policy, was loudly applauded by the faithful supporters of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Napoleon III, always a prey to indecision, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> asked himself from time to time whether his policy was a wise one, but the circumstances which he himself had created carried him along. Late in 1864 he thought of negotiating an alliance between the Courts of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> and <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> against <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, so as to allow <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to get possession of Venetia. Having paved the way for Italian unity, he was inaugurating a policy by means of which <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> was to achieve German unity. He did nothing to prevent the conquest of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> by <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> at Sadowa (1866), and when he made a vain attempt to have Luxemburg ceded to him, Bismarck exploited the proceedings to convince public opinion in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> of the danger of French <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> and the serious necessity of arming against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. By the end of 1866 the withdrawal of the French troops which had guarded the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was complete. But Napoleon at the very time when he was thus carrying out the Convention of 15 September was organizing at Antibes a legion to be placed at the disposal of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; he once more exacted of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> a pledge not to invade the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>; he conceived a plan to obtain from the Powers a collective guarantee of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> temporal sovereignty. On 3 November, 1866, he wrote to his friend Francesco Arese: "People must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I will yield nothing on the Roman question, and that my mind is made up, while carrying out the Convention of 15 September, to support the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by all possible means". But the season of ill-luck and of blundering was setting in for the Imperial diplomacy. None of the Powers responded to Napoleon's appeal. <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, displeased at the organization of the Antibes Legion and the confidence reposed by the emperor in Rouher, a devoted champion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests, complained bitterly: Napoleon answered by complaining of the Garibaldian musters that threatened the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> territories. When the Garibaldians made an actual incursion, on 25 October, 1867, the French troops which had for some weeks been concentrated at Toulon, embarked for Civiti&acirc; Vecchia and helped the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> troops defeat the invaders at Mentana. <a href="../cathen/01583d.htm">Cardinal Antonelli</a> asked that the French forces should be directed against those of Victor Emmanuel, but the emperor refused. Menabrea, Victor Emmanuel's minister, though he gave orders for the arrest of the Garibaldians, published in spite of Napoleon, a circular affirming <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy's</a> right to possess <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Napoleon found it increasingly difficult to extricate himself from the coils of the Roman Question; he was still thinking of a <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> congress, but <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> declined. At the close of 1867, Thier's speech in support of the temporal power gave Rouher occasion to say, amid the applause of the majority, "We declare it in the name of the French government, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> shall not take possession of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Never, never will <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> tolerate such an assault upon her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and her <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>". That never was extremely unpleasant to the Italian patriots. The emperor had offended both the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> at the same time. When the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> was convoked the imperial government manifested no antagonism. M. Emile Ollivier, president of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, opined, on 2 January, 1870, that the States ought not to interfere in the deliberations of the council. His colleague Daru instructed Banneville, the French ambassador to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on 20 February, to protest in the name of French Constitutional law against the programme of enactments "De ecclesia", and tried to bring about concerted action of the Powers; but, after <a href="../cathen/01583d.htm">Antonelli's</a> demurrer of 10 March, Daru confined himself to reiterating his objections in a memorandum (5 April) which <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> declined to submit to the council. M. Ollivier, against the requests of certain anti-infallibilist <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, directed Banneville not to try to meddle in the proceedings of the council. In 1870 Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern's claim to the crown of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> brought on a conflict between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and King William of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. A dispatch relating to a conversation which took place at Ems, between William and Napoleon's ambassador, Benedetti, was, as Bismarck himself afterwards confessed, tampered with in such a way as to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> inevitable. Bismarck's own "Recollections" thus supply the refutation of the charge made by him in the Reichstag (5 December, 1874), that the empress and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had desired the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and driven him into it. The German historian Sybel has formally cleared the empress and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of this accusation. (On this point, which has provoked numerous polemics, see D&uuml;hr, "Jesuitenfabeln", 4th ed., Freiburg, 1904, pp. 877-79). <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> wrote to Emperor William offering his good offices as mediator (22 July, 1870), but to no purpose. As for the Italian government, on 16 July, 1870, it refused an alliance with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> because Napoleon had refused it <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On 20 July Napoleon promised that the imperial troops should be recalled from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but no more, and so, as usual, he offended both the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, whom he was about to leave defenceless, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, whose highest ambitions he was balking. The negotiations between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> were continued in August, by Prince Napoleon, who made a visit to Florence. <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> absolutely insisted upon being allowed to take <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and, on 29 August, Visconti Venosta, minister of foreign affairs, affirmed the right of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> to have <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for their capital. The anti-Catholic controversialists of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> have often made use of these facts to support their allegation that the emperor would have had the Italian alliance in the War of 1870 if he had not persisted in his demand that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should remain master of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy's</a> abstention entailed that of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, which would have helped <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> if <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> had. M. Welschinger has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that in 1870 these two powers were in no condition to be of material assistance to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. After the surrender of Sedan (2 September, 1870), Napoleon was sent, a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, to Wilhelmsh&ouml;he, where he learned that the Republic had been proclaimed at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 4 September, and that the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> had occupied <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (20 September). The National Assembly of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, on 28 February, 1871, confirmed the emperor's dethronement. After the Peace of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> he went to reside at Chiselburst, where he died. His only son, Eugene-Louis-Jean-Joseph,Napol&eacute;on, born 16 March, 1856, was killed by the Zulus, 23 June, 1879. Napoleon III left unfinished a "Vie de C&eacute;sar", begun in 1865, with the assistance of the historian Duruy, and of which only three volumes were published. His history still affords occasion for numerous polemics animated by party feeling. The portrait of him drawn by Victor Hugo in "Les Ch&acirc;timents" is extremely unfair. Napoleon was a tender-hearted dreamer, kindness was one of his most evident qualities. As regards his personal practice of religion, he was faithful to his <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. Much of the censure which his foreign policy has merited is equally applicable to the anticlericals and the Republicans of his time, whose press organs were clamouring for French aid towards the speedy realization of Italian unity, while their systematic opposition, in 1868, to the Government programme for strengthening the army was partly responsible for the military weakness of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1870.
