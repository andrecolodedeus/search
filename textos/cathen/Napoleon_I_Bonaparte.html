<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Napoleon I (Bonaparte)</h1>  

<p>Emperor of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a>, second son of Charles Marie Bonaparte and Maria L&aelig;titia Ramolino, b. at <a href="../cathen/01238b.htm">Ajaccio</a>, in <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>, 15 August, 1769; d. on the Island of St. Helena, 5 May, 1821.

<p>His childhood was spent in <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>; at the end of the year 1778 he entered the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, in 1779 the military <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Brienne, and in 1783 the military <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In 1785, when he was in garrison at <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a>, as a lieutenant, he occupied his leisure with researches into the history of <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a> and read many of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of his time, particularly Rousseau. These studies left him attached to a sort of <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deism</a>, an admirer of the <a href="../cathen/08382a.htm">personality of Christ</a>, a stranger to all religious practices, and breathing defiance against "sacerdotalism" and "theocracy". His attitude under the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> was that of a citizen devoted to the new <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, in testimony of which attitude we have his scolding letter, written in 1790, to Battafuoco, a deputy from the <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsican</a> <em>noblesse</em>, whom the "patriots" regarded as a traitor, and also a work published by Bonaparte in 1793, "Le Souperde Beaucaire", in which he takes the side of the Mountain in the Convention against the Federalist tendencies of the Girondins.

<p>His military genius revealed itself in December, 1793, when he was twenty-four years of age, in his recapture of Toulon from the English. He was made a general of brigade in the artillery, 20 December, and in 1794 contributed to Mass&eacute;na's victories in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The political suspicions aroused by his friendship with the younger Robespierre after 9 Thermidor of the Year III (27 July, 1794), the intrigues which led to his being removed from the Italian frontier and sent to command a brigade against the Vendeans in the west, and ill health, which he used as a pretext to refuse this post and remain in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, almost brought his career to an end. He contemplated leaving <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to take command of the sultan's artillery. But in 1795 when the Convention was threatened, Bonaparte was selected for the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of pouring grapeshot upon its enemies from the platform of the church of <a href="../cathen/13100c.htm">Saint Roch</a> (13 Vend&eacute;miaire, Year IV). He displayed great moderation in his hour of victory, and managed to earn at once the gratitude of the Convention and the esteem of its enemies.
<h3>The campaign in Italy</h3>

<p>On 8 March, 1798, he contracted a <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">civil marriage</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Alexandre de Beauharnais, Marie Jos&eacute;phine Rose Tascher de la Pagerie, who was born in <a href="../cathen/09731a.htm">Martinique</a>, in 1763, of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> originally belonging to the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a>. In the same month Napoleon set out for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where the Directory, prompted by Carnot, had appointed him commander in chief against the First Coalition. The victory of Montenotte, over the Austrians commanded by Beaulieu, and those of Millesimo, Dego, Ceva, and Mondov&igrave;, over Colle's <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> troops, forced Victor Amadeus, King of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, to conclude the armistice of Cherasco (28 April, 1796). Wishing to effect a junction on the Danube with the Army of the Rhine, Bonaparte spent the following May in driving Beaulieu across Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and succeeded in pushing him back into the Tyrol. On 7 May he was ordered by the Directory to leave half of his troops in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, under Kellermann's command, and march with the other half against Leghorn, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. Unwilling to share the glory with Kellermann, Bonaparte replied by tendering his resignation, and the order was not insisted on. In a proclamation to his soldiers (20 May, 1796) he declared his intention of leading them to the banks of the Tiber to chastise those who had "whetted the daggers of civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>" and "basely assassinated" Basseville, the French minister, to "re-establish the Capitol, place there in honour the statues of heroes who had made themselves famous", and to "arouse the Roman people benumbed by many centuries of bondage". In June he entered the Romagna, appeared at Bologna and <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, and made <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> of several <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. The Court of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> demanded an armistice, and Bonaparte, who was far from eager for this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, granted it. The Peace of Bologna (23 June, 1796) <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to give up Bologna and <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> to French occupation, to pay twenty one million francs, to surrender 100 pictures, 500 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and the busts of Junius and Marcus Brutus. The Directory thought these terms too easy, and when a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was sent to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to negotiate the treaty, he was told that as an indispensable condition of peace, <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> must revoke the Briefs relating to the Civil Constitution of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>. The Pope refused, and negotiations were broken off; they failed again at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, where an attempt had been made to renew them.

<p>During these <em>pourparlers</em> between <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Bonaparte repulsed the repeated efforts of the Austrian Wurmser to reconquer <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. Between 1 and 5 August, Wurmser was twice beaten at Lonato and again at Castiglione; between 8 and 15 September, the battles of Roveredo, Primolano, Bassano, and San Giorgio forced Wurmser to take refuge in <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, and on 16 October Bonaparte created the Cispadan Republic at the expense of the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a> and of the Legations, which were pontifical territory. Then, 24 October, he invited Cacault, the French minister at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to reopen negotiations with <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> "so as to catch the old fox"; but on 28 October he wrote to the same Cacault: "You may assure the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> that I have always been opposed to the treaty which the Directory has offered him, and above all to the manner of negotiating it. I am more ambitious to be called the preserver than the destroyer of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. If they will be sensible at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, we will profit by it to give peace to that beautiful part of the world and to calm the conscientious fears of many people." Meanwhile the arrival in Venetia of the Austrian troops under Alvinzi caused Cardinal Busca, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> secretary of state, to hasten the conclusion of an alliance between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the Court of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>; of this Bonaparte learned through intercepted letters. His victories at Arcoli (17 November, 1796) and Rivoli (14 January, 1797) and the capitulation of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a> (2 February, 1797), placed the whole of Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in his hands, and in the spring of 1797 the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a> were at his mercy.



<p>The Directory sent him ferocious instructions. "The Roman religion", they wrote, "will always be the irreconcilable enemy of the Republic; first by its essence, and next, because its servants and <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> will never forgive the blows which the Republic has aimed at the fortune and standing of some, and the prejudices and habits of others. The Directory requests you to do all that you deem possible, without rekindling the torch of fanaticism, to destroy the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Government, either by putting <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under some other power or" which would be still better "by establishing some form of self government which would render the yoke of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> odious." But at the very moment when Bonaparte received these instructions he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, by his private correspondence, that a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> awakening was beginning in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Clarke wrote to him: "We have become once more Roman Catholic in France", and explained to him that the help of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> might perhaps be needed before long to bring the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to accept the state of things resulting from the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. Considerations such as these must have made an impression on a statesman like Bonaparte, who, moreover, at about this period, said to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>: "A <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> without religion is like a ship without a compass; there is no good morality without religion." And in February, 1797, when he entered the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a> with his troops, he forbade any insult to religion, and showed kindness to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, even to the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> who had taken refuge in <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> territory, and whom he might have caused to be shot as &eacute;migr&eacute;s. He contented himself with levying a great many contributions, and laying hands on the treasury of the <a href="../cathen/13454b.htm">Santa Casa</a> at Loretto. The first advances of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> to his "dear son General Bonaparte" were met by Bonaparte's declaring that he was ready to treat. "I am treating with this rabble of priests [<em>cette pr&ecirc;traille</em>], and for this once Saint Peter will again save the Capitol", he wrote to Joubert, 17 February, 1797. The Peace of Tolentino was negotiated on 19 February; the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> surrendered the Legations of Bologna, <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, and recognized the annexation of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and the Comtat Venaissin by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. But Bonaparte had taken care not to infringe upon the spiritual power, and had not demanded of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> the withdrawal of those Briefs which were offensive to the Directory. As soon as the treaty was signed he wrote to <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> to express to him "his perfect esteem and veneration"; on the other hand, feeling that the Directory would be displeased, he wrote to it: "My opinion is that <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, once deprived of Bologna, <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, the Romagna, and the thirty millions we are taking from her, can no longer exist. The old machine will go to pieces of itself." And he proposed that the Directory should take the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> steps with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in regard to the religious situation in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>Then, with breathless rapidity, turning back towards the Alps, and assisted by Joubert, Mass&eacute;na, and Bernadotte, he inflicted on Archduke Charles a series of defeats which forced <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> to sign the preliminaries of Leoben (18 April, 1797). In May he transformed <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> into the Ligurian Republic; in October he imposed on the archduke the Treaty of Campo Formio, by which <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> obtained <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, the Rhine country with <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and the Ionian Islands, while <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> was made subject to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The Directory found fault with this last stipulation; but Bonaparte had already reached the point where he could act with independence and care little for what the politicians at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> might think. It was the same with his religious policy: he now began to think of invoking the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> assistance to restore peace in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. A note which he addressed to the Court of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 3 August, 1797, was conceived in these terms: "The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> will perhaps think it worthy of his wisdom, of the most holy of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, to execute a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> or ordinance commanding <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to preach obedience to the Government, and to do all in their power to strengthen the established constitution. After the first step, it would be useful to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what others could be taken to reconcile the constitutional <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> with the non constitutional."

<p>While Bonaparte was expressing himself thus, the Councils of the Five Hundred and the Ancients were passing a law to recall, amnesty, and restore to their civil and political <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who had refused to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. But Directors Barr&egrave;s, Rewbell, and Lareveill&egrave;re L&eacute;peaux, considering that this act jeopardized the Republic, employed General Augereau, Bonaparte's lieutenant, to carry out the <em>coup d'&eacute;tat</em> of 18 Fructidor against the Councils (4 Sept., 1797), and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was once more a prey to a Jacobin and anti-Catholic policy. These events were immediately echoed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where Joseph Bonaparte, the general's brother, and ambassador from the Directory, was asked by the latter, to favour the Revolutionary party. Disturbances arose: General Duphot was killed in Joseph Bonaparte's house (28 December, 1797), and the Directory demanded satisfaction from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. General Bonaparte had just returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he apparently confined himself to his functions as a member of the Institute (Scientific Section). He was by no means anxious to lead the expedition against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which the Directory was projecting, and contented himself with giving Berthier, who commanded it, certain instructions from a distance. For this expedition for Berthier's entry into <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the proclamation of the Roman Republic (10-15 February, 1798), and for the captivity of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, who was carried off a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a>, see <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">P<font size=-2>IUS</font> VI</a>.
<h3>The campaign in Egypt</h3>

<p>While in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Bonaparte induced the Directory to take up the plan of an expedition to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. His object was to make the Mediterranean a French lake, by the conquest of <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a> and the Nile Valley, and to menace <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in the direction of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. He embarked on 19 May, 1798. The taking of <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a> (10 June), of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> (2 July), the battle of the Pyramids (21 July), gave Bonaparte the uncontested mastery of Cairo. At Cairo he affected a great respect for <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a>; reproached with this later on, he replied: "It was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for General Bonaparte to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the principles of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islamism</a>, the government, the opinions of the four <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, and their relations with Constantinople and <a href="../cathen/10099a.htm">Mecca</a>. It was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, indeed, for him to be thoroughly acquainted with both <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, for it helped him to win the affection of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and of the ulemas in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>."

<p>The French troops in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> were in great danger when the naval disaster of Aboukir, inflicted by Nelson, had cut them off from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Turkey took sides with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>: in the spring of 1799, Bonaparte made a campaign in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> to strike both Turkey and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Failing to effect the surrender of <a href="../cathen/01110b.htm">Acre</a>, and as his army was suffering from the plague (May, 1799), he had to make his way back to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. There he re-established French prestige by the victory of Aboukir (25 July, 1799), then, learning that the Second Coalition was gaining immense successes against the armies of the Directory, he left Kl&eacute;ber in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and returned secretly to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He landed at <a href="../cathen/06269a.htm">Fr&eacute;jus</a>, 9 October, 1799, and was in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> seven days later. Besides certain political results, the expedition to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> had borne fruit for <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>: Egyptology dates its existence from the creation of the Institute of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (<em>Institut d'Egypte</em>) by Bonaparte.
<h3>Bonaparte, First Consul</h3>

<p>While Bonaparte was in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the religious policy of the Directory had provoked serious troubles in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Deportations of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were multiplying; <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, where 6000 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were proscribed, was disturbed; the Vend&eacute;e, <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, and the departments of the South were rising. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was angry and uneasy. Spurred on by his brother Lucien, president of the Five Hundred, allied with Directors Siey&egrave;s and Roger Ducos, Bonaparte caused Directors Gohier and Moulins to be <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, and broke up the Five Hundred (18 Brumaire; 9-10 November, 1799). The Directorial Constitution was suppressed, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> thenceforward was ruled by three consuls. First Consul Bonaparte put into operation the Constitution known as that of the Year VIII, substituted for the departmental administrators elected by the citizens, others appointed by the Executive Power, and reorganized the judicial and financial administrations. He commissioned the Abb&eacute; Bernier to quiet the religious disturbance of the Vendeans, and authorized the return of the non juring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> on condition of their simply promising fidelity to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the republic. Then, to make an end of the Second Coalition, he entrusted the Army of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> to Moreau, and, himself taking command of the Army of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, crossed the Great St. Bernard (13-16 May, 1800) and, with the co operation of Desaix, who was mortally wounded, crushed the Austrians (14 June, 1800) between Marengo and San Giuliano at the very spot he had marked on the map in his study in the Tuileries. The Peace of Lun&eacute;ville, concluded with <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, 9 February, 1801, extended the territory of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to 102 departments.

<p>Bonaparte spent the years 1801 and 1802 effecting internal reforms in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. A commission, established in 1800, elaborated a new code which, as the "Code Napol&eacute;on", was to be <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in 1804, to formally introduce some of the "principles of 1789" into French law, and thus to complete the civil results of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. But it was Napoleon's desire that, in the new <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> which was the issue of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should have a place, and consciences should be set at rest. The <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat with the Holy See</a> was signed on 17 July, 1801; it was published, together with the <a href="../cathen/01756a.htm">Organic Articles</a>, as a law, 16 April, 1802. The former of these two acts established the existence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, while the other involved the possibility of serious interference by the State in the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Napoleon never said, "The Concordat was the great fault of my reign." On the contrary, years afterwards, at St. Helena, he considered it his greatest achievement, and congratulated himself upon having, by the signature of the Concordat, "raised the fallen altars, put a stop to disorders, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the Republic, dissipated the scruples of those who had acquired the national domains, and broken the last thread by which the old dynasty maintained communication with the country." Fox, in a conversation with Napoleon at this period, expressed astonishment at his not having insisted upon the marriage of priests: "I had, and still have, to accomplish peace", Napoleon replied, "theological controversies are allayed with water, not with oil." The Concordat had wrecked the hopes of those who, like Mme de Sta&euml;l, had wished to make <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> the state religion of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; and yet the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> Jaucourt, defending the <a href="../cathen/01756a.htm">Organic Articles</a> before the Tribunat, gloried in the definitive recognition of the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> religion by the state. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish religion</a> was not recognized until later (17 March, 1808), after the assembly of a certain number of Jewish delegates appointed by the prefects (29 July, 1806) and the meeting of the Great Sanhedrim (10 February &mdash; 9 April, 1807); the State, however, did not make itself responsible for the salaries of the rabbis. Thus did the new master of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> regulate the religious situation in that country.

<p>On 9 April, 1802, <a href="../cathen/03313a.htm">Caprara</a> was received for the first time by Bonaparte in the official capacity of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII's</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate <em>a latere</em></a>, and before the first consul took an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> which, according to the text subsequently published by the "Moniteur", bound him to observe the constitution, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, and customs of the republic, and nowise to derogate from the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, liberties, and privileges of the Gallican Church. This was a painful surprise for the Vatican, and Caprara declared that the words about Gallican liberties had been interpolated in the "Moniteur". Another painful impression was produced at the Vatican by the attitude of eight constitutional <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> whom Bonaparte had nominated to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, and to whom Caprara had granted <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a>, and who afterwards boasted that they had never formally <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> their adhesion to the Civil Constitution of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In retaliation, the Roman curia demanded of the constitutional <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> a formal retractation of the Civil Constitution, but Bonaparte opposed this and when Caprara insisted, declared that if <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> pushed matters too far the consuls would yield to the desire of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to become <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. <a href="../cathen/14434b.htm">Talleyrand</a> spoke to Caprara in the same sense, and the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> desisted from his demands. On the other hand, though Bonaparte had at first been extremely irritated by the allocution of 24 May, 1802, in which <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> demanded the revision of the <a href="../cathen/01756a.htm">Organic Articles</a>, he ended by allowing it to be published in the "Moniteur" as a diplomatic document. A spirit of conciliation on both sides tended to promote more cordial relations between the two powers. The proclamation of Bonaparte as consul for life (August, 1802) increased in him the sense of his responsibility towards the religion of the country, and in <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> the desire to be on good terms with a personage who was advancing with such long strides towards <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>.

<p>Bonaparte took care to gain the attachment of the revived Church by his favours. While he dissolved the associations of the Fathers of the Faith, the Adorers of Jesus, and the Panarists, which looked to him like attempts to restore the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, he permitted the reconstitution of the Sisters of Charity, the Sisters of St. Thomas, the Sisters of St. Charles, and the Vatelotte Sisters, devoted to teaching and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> work, and made his mother, Madame L&aelig;titia Bonaparte, protectress of all the congregations of <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> sisters. He favoured the revival of the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Institute of the Christian Schools</a> for the religious instruction of boys; side by side with the <em>lyc&eacute;es</em>, he permitted secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> under the supervision of the prefects, but directed by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. He did not rest content with a mere strict fulfilment of the pecuniary <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to which the Concordat had bound the State; in 1803 and 1804 it became the custom to pay stipends to canons and <em>desservants</em> of succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. Orders were issued to leave the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in possession of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> buildings not included in the new circumscription of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. Though the State had not bound itself to endow <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, Bonaparte granted the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> national estates for the use of such <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to receive donations and legacies for their benefit; he even founded, in 1804, at the expense of the State, ten <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, re-established, with a government endowment, the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> house for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of missionaries, and placed the Holy Sepulchre and the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Christians</a> under the protection of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>As to the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> Bonaparte at this period affected a somewhat complaisant attitude towards the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. He restored <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a> and <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and brought about the restitution of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> and Pontecorvo by the Court of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. After April, 1803, Cacault was replaced, as his representative at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, by one of the five <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> to whom <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> had consented to grant the purple late in 1802. This ambassador was no other than Bonaparte's own uncle, <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Cardinal Joseph Fesch</a>, whose secretary for a short time was <a href="../cathen/03640a.htm">Chateaubriand</a>, recently made famous by his "La g&eacute;nie du Christianisme". One of Bonaparte's grievances against Cacault was a saying attributed to the latter: "How many sources of his glory would cease if Bonaparte ever chose to play <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a>!" Even in those days of harmony Cacault had a presentiment that the Napoleonic policy would yet threaten the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a struggle with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> became more and more an imperious obsession of Bonaparte's mind. The Peace of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a> (25 March, 1802) was only a truce: it was broken on 22 May, 1803, by Mortier's invasion of <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a> and the landing of the English in French Guiana. Napoleon forthwith prepared for his gigantic effort to lay the ban of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> on <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The Duc d'Enghien, who was suspected of complicity with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and the French Royalists, was carried off from Ettenheim, a village within the territory of <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, and shot at Vincennes, 21 March, 1804, and one of <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Cardinal Fesch's</a> first acts as ambassador at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was to demand the extradition of the French <em>&eacute;migr&eacute;</em> Vern&egrave;gues, who was in the service of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and whom Bonaparte regarded as a conspirator.
<h2>Napoleon Emperor</h2>
<h3>The coronation</h3>

<p>While the Third Coalition was forming between <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, Bonaparte caused himself to be proclaimed hereditary emperor (30 April 18 May, 1804), and at once surrounded himself with a brilliant Court. He created two princes imperial (his brothers Joseph and Louis), seven permanent high dignitaries, twenty great officers, four of them ordinary marshals, and ten marshals in active service, a number of posts at Court open to members of the old nobility. Even before his formal proclamation as emperor, he had given Caprara a hint of his desire to be <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, not at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, like the ancient kings, but at Notre Dame de Paris. On 10 May, 1804, Caprara warned <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> of this wish, and represented that it would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to answer yes, in order to retain Napoleon's friendship. But the execution of the Duc d'Enghien had produced a deplorable impression in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; Royalist influences were at work against Bonaparte at the Vatican, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was warned against crowning an emperor who, by the Constitution of 1804, would promise to maintain "the laws of the Concordat", in other words, the <a href="../cathen/01756a.htm">Organic Articles</a>. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> and <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> tried to gain time by dilatory replies, but these very replies were interpreted by <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Fesch</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and by Caprara at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in a sense favourable to the emperor's wishes. At the end of June, Napoleon I joyfully announced, at the Tuileries, that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had promised to come to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Then <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> tried to obtain certain religious and political advantages in exchange for the journey he was asked to make. Napoleon declared that he would have no conditions dictated to him; at the same time he promised to give new <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of his respect and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for religion, and to listen to what the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> might have to submit. At last the cleverness of Talleyrand, Napoleon's minister of foreign affairs, conquered the scruples of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>; he declared, at the end of September, that he would accept Napoleon's invitation if it were officially addressed to him; he asked only that the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> should not be distinct from the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> proper, and that Napoleon would undertake not to detain him in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Napoleon had the invitation conveyed to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, not by two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> expected, but by a general; and before setting out for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> signed a conditional act of abdication, which the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> were to publish in case Napoleon should prevent his returning to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; then he began his journey to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 2 November, 1804.

<p>Napoleon would not accord any solemn reception to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>; surrounded by a hunting party, he met the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the open country, made him get into the imperial carriage, seating himself on the right, and in this fashion took him to Fontainebleau. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> was brought to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> by night. The whole affair nearly fell through at the last moment. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> informed Josephine herself, on the eve of the day set for the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of the empress, that she had not been married to Napoleon in accordance with the rules of religion. To the great annoyance of the emperor, who was already contemplating a <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, in case no heir were born to him, and was displaying a lively irritation against Josephine, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> insisted upon the religious benediction of the marriage; otherwise, there was to be no <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>. The religious marriage <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was secretly performed at the Tuileries, on the first of December, without witnesses, not during the night, but at about four o'clock in the afternoon, by <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Fesch</a>, grand almoner of the imperial household. As Welschinger has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Fesch</a> had previously asked the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> and faculties, and the marriage was canonically beyond reproach. On 2 December the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> took place. Napoleon arrived at Notre Dame later than the hour appointed. Instead of allowing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to crown him, he himself placed the crown on his own head and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> the empress, but, out of respect for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, this detail was not recorded in the "Moniteur". <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, to whom Napoleon granted but few opportunities for conversation, had a long memoranda drawn up by <a href="../cathen/01584a.htm">Antonelli</a> and Caprara, setting forth his wishes; he demanded that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> should be recognized in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as the dominant religion; that the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> law should be repealed; that the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities should be re-established; that the Legations should be restored to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Most of these demands were to no purpose: the most important of the very moderate concessions made by the emperor was his promise to substitute the Gregorian Calendar for that of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> after 1 January, 1806. When <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> left <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 4 April, 1805, he was displeased with the emperor.

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> acclaimed the emperor. He was lauded to the skies by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, not only in obedience to instructions, but also out of <a href="../cathen/03794b.htm">patriotism</a>, preached against <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and exhorted their hearers to submit to the conscription. The splendour of the Napoleonic victories seemed, by the enthusiasm with which it inspired all <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a>, to blind the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to Napoleon's <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> view of the manner in which their Church should be governed. He had reorganized it; he had accorded it more liberal pecuniary advantages than the Concordat had bound him to; but he intended to dominate it. For example, in 1806 he insisted that all periodical publications of a <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> should be consolidated into one, the "Journal des cur&eacute;s", published under police surveillance. On 15 August, 1806, he instituted the Feast of St. Napoleon, to commemorate the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Neopolis, or Neopolas, who suffered in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>. In 1806 he decided that <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> positions of importance, such as cures of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the first class, could be given only to candidates who held degrees conferred by the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, adding that these degrees might be refused to those who were <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> for their "ultramontane <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> or <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> dangerous to authority". He demanded the publication of a single <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> for the whole empire, in which <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> he was called "the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> upon earth," "the Lord's anointed", and the use of which was made compulsory by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 4 April, 1806. The <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> of Vincennes, Fenestrelles, and the Island of Sainte Marguerite received <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> whom the emperor judged guilty of disobedience to his orders.
<h3>The great victories; occupation of Rome; imprisonment of Pius VII (1805-09)</h3>

<p>After 1805 relations between <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> and Napoleon became strained. At <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 26 May, 1805, when Napoleon, as King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, took the Iron Crown of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, he was offended because the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did not take part in the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. When he asked <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> to annul the marriage which his brother Jerome Bonaparte had contracted, at the age of nineteen with Elizabeth Patterson of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> replied that the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> against <a href="../cathen/04001a.htm">clandestine marriages</a> applied only where they had been recognized, and the reply constituted one more cause of displeasure for the emperor, who afterwards, in 1806, obtained an annulment from the complaisant <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. And when <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a>, in 1805, complained that the French Civil Code, and with it the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> law, had been introduced into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Napoleon formally refused to make any concession.

<p>The great <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which the emperor was just then commencing was destined to be an occasion of conflict with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Abandoning the preparations which he had made for an invasion of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (the Camp of Boulogne), he turned against <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, brought about the capitulation of Ulm (20 October, 1805), made himself master of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (13 November), defeated at Austerlitz (2 December, 1805) Emperor Francis I and Tsar Alexander. The Treaty of Presburg (26 December, 1805) united <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> to the French Empire and the territory of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>, made <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and Wurtemberg vassal kingdoms of Napoleon, enlarged the margravate of <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, and transformed it into a grand duchy, and reduced <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> to the valley of the Danube. The victory of Trafalgar (21 October, 1805) had given <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the mastery of the seas, but from that time forward Napoleon was held to be the absolute master of the Continent. He then turned to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and demanded a reckoning of him.

<p>To prevent a landing Russian and English troops in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Napoleon, in October, 1805, had ordered Gouvion Saint Cyr to occupy the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> city of <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, lest the powers hostile to Napoleon might some day reproach him with having consented to the employment of a city of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a> as a base of operations, had protested against this arbitrary exercise of power: he had complained, in a letter to the emperor (13 November, 1805), of this "cruel affront", declared that since his return from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> he had "experienced nothing but bitterness and sorrow", and threatened to dismiss the French ambassador.

<p>But the treaty of Presburg and the dethronement of the Bourbons of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> by Joseph Bonaparte and Mass&eacute;na (January, 1806), changed the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> and the Italian situation. From <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> Napoleon wrote two letters (7 January, 1806), one to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, and the other to <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Fesch</a>, touching his intentions in regard to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. He complained of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> ill will, tried to justify the occupation of <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, and declared himself the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> protector of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. "I will be the friend of Your Holiness", he concluded, "whenever you consult only your own heart and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> friends of religion." His letter to <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Fesch</a> was much more violent: he complained of the refusal to annul Jerome's marriage, demanded that there should no longer be any minister either of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> or of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, threatened to send a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> as his ambassador to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, to appoint a senator to command in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and to reduce the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to the status of mere <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>, claimed that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should treat him like <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, and assailed "the pontifical camarilla which prostituted religion". A reply from <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> (29 January, 1806), asking for the return of <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a> and the Legations let loose Napoleon's fury. In a letter to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> (13 February), he declared: "Your Holiness is the sovereign of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> but I am its emperor; all my enemies ought to be yours"; he insisted that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should drive English, Russian, <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> subjects out of his dominions, and close his ports to the ships of those powers with which <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; and he complained of the slowness of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> in granting <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In a letter to <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Fesch</a> he declared that, unless the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> acquiesced he would reduce the condition of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to what it had been before <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>.

<p>An official note from <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Fesch</a> to <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> (2 March, 1806) defined Napoleon's demands; the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> were in favour of rejecting them, and <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, in a very beautiful letter, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 21 March, 1806, remonstrated with Napoleon, declared that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to embroil himself with the other states, and must hold aloof from the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; also, that there was no emperor of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. "If our words", he concluded, "fail to touch Your Majesty's heart we will suffer with a resignation conformable to the Gospel, we will accept every kind of calamity as coming from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." Napoleon, more and more irritated, reproached <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> for having consulted the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> before answering him, declared that all his relations with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> should thenceforward be conducted through Talleyrand, ordered the latter to reiterate the demands which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had just rejected, and replaced <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Fesch</a> as ambassador at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with Alquier, a former member of the Convention. Then the emperor proceeded from words to deeds. On 6 May, 1806, he caused Civit&agrave; Vecchia to be occupied. Learning that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, before recognizing Joseph Bonaparte as King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, wished Joseph to submit to the ancient suzerainty of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> over the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan Kingdom</a>, he talked of "the spirit of light-headedness" (<em>esprit de vertige</em>) which prevailed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, remarked that, when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> thus treated a Bonaparte as a vassal, he must be tired of wielding the temporal power, and directed Talleyrand to tell <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> that the time was past when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> disposed of crowns. Talleyrand was informed (16 May, 1806) that, if <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> would not recognize Joseph, Napoleon would no longer recognize <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> as a temporal prince. "If this continues", Napoleon went on to say, "I will have <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> taken away from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>." He suspected <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> of having sold himself to the English. Early in June, 1806, he seized <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> and Pontecorvo, two principalities which belonged to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, but which were shut in by the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>.

<p>Yielding before the emperor's wrath, <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> resigned his office: <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> unwillingly accepted his resignation, and replaced him with Cardinal Casoni. But the first dispatch written by Casoni under <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII's</a> dictation confirmed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> resistance to the emperor's behests. Napoleon then <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> apostrophized Caprara, in the presence of the whole court, threatening to dismember the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>, if <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> did not at once, "without ambiguity or reservation", declare himself his ally (1 July, 1806). A like ultimatum was delivered, on 8 July, to Cardinal Casoni by Alquier. But Continental affairs were claiming Napoleon's attention, and the only immediate result of his ultimatum was the emperor's order to his generals occupying <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a> and Civit&agrave; Vecchia, to seize the pontifical revenues in those two cities. On the other hand, the constitution of the Imperial University (May, 1806), preparing for a state monopoly of teaching, loomed up as a peril to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> right of teaching, and gave the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> another cause for uneasiness.

<p>The Confederation of the Rhine, formed by Napoleon out of fourteen German States (12 July, 1806), and his assertion of a protectorate over the same, resulted in Francis II's abdication of the title of emperor of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; it its place Francis took the title of emperor of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Thus ended, under the blows dealt it by Napoleon, that Holy Roman Germanic Empire which had exerted so great an influence over <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the German emperor had long been considered as sharing between them the government of the world in the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Napoleon had definitively annihilated one of these "two halves of God", as Victor Hugo has termed them. Frederick William II of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> became alarmed, and in October, 1806, formed, with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, the Fourth Coalition. The stunning victories of Auerst&auml;dt, won by Davoust, and Jena, won by Napoleon (14 October, 1806), were followed by the entry of the French into <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, the king of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia's</a> flight to K&ouml;nigsberg, and the erection of the Electorate of Saxony into a kingdom in alliance with Napoleon. From Berlin itself Napoleon launched a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> (21 November, 1806) by which he organized the Continental blockade against <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, aiming to close the whole Continent against English commerce. Then, in 1807, penetrating into <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, he induced the tsar by means of the battles of Eylau (8 February, 1807) and Friedland (14 June, 1807), to sign the Peace of Tilsit (8 July, 1807). The empire was at its apogee; <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> had been bereft of its Polish provinces, given to the King of Saxony under the name of the Grand Duchy of <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>; the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> was being formed for Jerome Bonaparte, completing the series of kingdoms given since 1806 to the emperor's brothers &mdash; <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> having been assigned to Joseph, and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> to Louis. A series of principalities and duchies, "great fiefs", created all over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> for his marshals, augmented the might and prestige of the empire. At home, the emperor's personal power was becoming more and more firmly established; the supervision of the press more rigorous; summary incarcerations more frequent. He created an hereditary nobility as an ornament to the throne.

<p>To him it was something of a humiliation, that the Court of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> persisted in holding aloof, politically, from the great conflicts of the nations. He began to summon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> anew. He had already, soon after Jena, called Mgr Arezzo to him from <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, and in menacing fashion had bidden him go and demand of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> that he should become the ally of the empire; once more <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> had replied to Arezzo that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> could not consider the enemies of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> his enemies. Napoleon also accused the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of hindering the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reorganization of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and of not making provision for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Venetia. His grievances were multiplying. On 22 July, 1807, he wrote to Prince Eug&egrave;ne, who governed <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> as his viceroy, a letter intended to be shown to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>: "There were kings before there were popes", it ran. "Any <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> who denounced me to <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> would cease to be <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in my eyes; I would look upon him as <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. I would cut my peoples off from all communication with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Does the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> take me for Louis the Pious? What the Court of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> seeks is the disorder of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not the good of religion. I will not fear to gather the Gallican, Italian, German and Polish Churches in a council to transact my business [<em>pour faire mes affaires</em>] without any <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and protect my peoples against the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This is the last time that I will enter into any discussion with the Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> rabble [<em>la pr&ecirc;traille romaine</em>]". On 9 August Napoleon wrote again to Prince Eug&egrave;ne, that, if the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did anything imprudent, it would afford excellent grounds for taking the Roman States away from him. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, driven to bay, sent <a href="../cathen/09293a.htm">Cardinal Litta</a> to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to treat with Napoleon: the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was willing to join the Continental blockade, and suspend all intercourse with the English, but not to declare <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against them. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> even wrote to Napoleon (11 September, 1807) inviting him to come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The emperor, however, was only seeking occasion for a rupture, while the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was seeking the last possible means of pacification.

<p>Napoleon refused to treat with <a href="../cathen/09293a.htm">Cardinal Litta</a>, and demanded that <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> should be represented by a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchman</a>, Cardinal de Bayanne. Then he pretended that Bayanne's powers from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> were not sufficient. And while the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was negotiating with him in <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a>, Napoleon, without warning, caused the four pontifical Provinces of <a href="../cathen/09492a.htm">Macerata</a>, <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06124b.htm">Foligno</a> to be occupied by General Lemarrois (October, 1807). <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> then revoked Cardinal Bayanne's powers. It as evident that, not only did Napoleon require of him an offensive alliance against <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but that the Emperor's pretensions, and those of his new minister of foreign affairs, Champagny, <a href="../cathen/14434b.htm">Talleyrand's</a> successor, were now beginning to encroach upon the domain of religion. Napoleon claimed that one third of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> should belong to the French Empire; and Champagny let it be understood that the emperor would soon demand that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> should respect the "Gallican Liberties", and should abstain from "any act containing positive clauses or reservations calculated to alarm consciences and spread divisions in His Majesty's dominions". Henceforth it was the spiritual authority that Napoleon aspired to control. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> ordered Bayanne to reject the imperial demands. Napoleon then (January, 1808) decided that Prince Eug&egrave;ne and King Joseph should place troops at the disposition of General Miollis, who was ordered to march on <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Miollis at first pretended to be covering the rear of the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> army, then he suddenly threw 10,000 troops into <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (2 February). Napoleon wrote to Champagny that it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> "to accustom the people of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the French troops to live side by side, so that, should the Court of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> continue to act in an insensate way, it might insensibly cease to exist as a temporal power, without anyone noticing the change". Thus it may be said that, in the beginning of 1808, Napoleon's plan was to keep <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>In a manifesto to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> powers, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> protested against this invasion; at the same time, he consented to receive General Miollis and treated him with great courtesy. Champagny, on 3 February, again insisted on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> becoming the political ally of Napoleon, and <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> refused. The instructions given to Miollis became more severe every day: he seized printing presses, journals, post offices; he decimated the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> by having seven <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> conducted to the frontier, because Napoleon accused them of dealing with the Bourbons of the two Sicilies, then, one month later, he expelled fourteen other <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> because they were not native subjects of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Cardinal Doria Pamphili, who had been appointed secretary of state, in February, 1808, was also expelled by Miollis; <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> now had with him only twenty-one <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Government was disorganized. He broke off all diplomatic relations with Napoleon, recalled Bayanne and Caprara from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and uttered his protest in a consistorial allocution delivered in March. Napoleon, on his side, recalled Alquier from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The struggle between <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor was taking on a tragic character.

<p>On 2 April Napoleon signed two decrees: one annexed to the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a> "in perpetuity" the Provinces of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, <a href="../cathen/09492a.htm">Macerata</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03216c.htm">Camerino</a>; the other ordered all functionaries of the Court of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> who were natives of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a> to return to that kingdom, under pain of confiscation of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> protested before all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> against this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, on 19 May, and, in an instruction addressed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the provinces which Napoleon was lopping off from his possessions, he denounced the religious "indifferentism" of the imperial Government, and forbade the faithful of those provinces to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance to Napoleon or accept any offices from him. Miollis retaliated, 12 June, by driving Gavrielli, the new secretary of state, out of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> then replaced Gavrielli with <a href="../cathen/11380b.htm">Cardinal Pacca</a>, reputed an opponent of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; on 11 July he delivered a very spirited allocution, which, in spite of the imperial police, was circulated throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; and <a href="../cathen/11380b.htm">Pacca</a>, on 24 August, directed a note against the institution of the "Civic Guard" &mdash; an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> recently conceived by Miollis &mdash; in which Miollis was compelling even the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> soldiers to enroll. On 6 September, 1808, Miollis sent two officers to the Quirinal to arrest <a href="../cathen/11380b.htm">Pacca</a>; <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> interposed, declaring that they should not arrest <a href="../cathen/11380b.htm">Pacca</a> without arresting the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and that in future the secretary of state should sleep at the Quirinal, which was closed to all the French.

<p>The definitive execution of Napoleon's projects against the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was retarded by the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> which occupied him during the year 1808. When he transferred his brother Joseph from the Throne of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> to that of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> rose, and the English invaded <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. Dupont's capitulation, at Baylen (20 July, 1808), and Junot's at Cintra (30 August, 1808), were painful reverses for French arms. Napoleon, having made an alliance with the tsar in the celebrated interview of Erfurt (27 September &mdash; 14 October, 1808), hastened to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. There he found a people whose spirit of resistance was exasperated all the more because they believed themselves to be fighting for their liberty and the integrity of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as much as for their country. In November he gained the victories of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, Espinosa, <a href="../cathen/15085b.htm">Tudela</a>, and Somo Sierra, and reopened the gates of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> for Joseph; on 21 February Saragossa was taken by the French armies after an heroic resistance. A Fifth Coalition was formed against Napoleon: he returned from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and, rushing across <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, bombarded and took <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (11 13 May, 1809). On the day after the victory he devoted some of his leisure hours to thinking about the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>For some time Murat, who in 1808 had replaced Joseph as King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, had been ready to support Miollis whenever Napoleon should judge that the hour had come to incorporate <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the empire. On 17 May, 1809, Napoleon issued from Sch&ouml;nbrunn two decrees in which, reproaching the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> for the ill use they had made of the donation of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, his "august predecessor", he declared the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a> annexed to the empire, and organized, under Miollis, a council extraordinary to administer them. On 10 June Miollis had the Pontifical flag, which still floated over the castle of St. Angelo, lowered. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> replied by having <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> placarded with a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> Napoleon. When the emperor received news of this (20 June) he wrote to Murat: "So the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has aimed an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against me. No more half measures; he is a raving lunatic who must be confined. Have <a href="../cathen/11380b.htm">Cardinal Pacca</a> and other adherents of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> arrested." In the night of 5 6 July, 1809, Radet, a general of gendarmerie, by the orders of Miollis, entered the Quirinal, arrested <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> and <a href="../cathen/11380b.htm">Pacca</a>, gave them two hours to make their preparations, and took them away from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at four in the morning. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> was taken to Savona, <a href="../cathen/11380b.htm">Pacca</a> to Fenestrella. Meanwhile Napoleon, completing the work of crushing <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, had been the victor at Essling (21 May, 1809) and at Wagram (6 July, 1809), and the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (15 October, 1809) put the finishing touch to the mutilation of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> by handing over Carniola, <a href="../cathen/04510a.htm">Croatia</a>, and Friuli to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, at the same time <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliging</a> the Emperor Francis to recognize Joseph as King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The young German, Staps, who attempted to assassinate Napoleon at Sch&ouml;enbrunn (13 October), died crying: "Long live <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>!"
<h3>Discussion with the captive Pius VII; second marriage; ecclesiastical councils of 1809 and 1811</h3>

<p>The conflict with his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, was another embarrassment, a new source of anxiety to the emperor. At first he took all possible steps to prevent the public from hearing of what had happened at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>: the "Moniteur" made not the slightest allusion to it; the newspapers received orders to be silent. He also wished his <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> to be ignored; the newspapers must be silent on this point also; but the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">Excommunication</a>, secretly brought to <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, was circulated in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by members of the Congregation, a pious association, founded 2 February, 1801, by P&egrave;re Delpuits, a former <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>. Alexis de Noailles and five other members of the Congregation were arrested by the emperor's command, and his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> extended to all the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. He wrote (12 September, 1809) to Bigot de Pr&eacute;ameneu, minister of public worship: "If on 1 October there are any missions or congregations still in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, I will hold you responsible." The celebrated Abb&eacute; Frayssinous had to discontinue his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>; the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> dispersed; the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a> were threatened. Napoleon consulted Bigot de Pr&eacute;ameneu as to the expediency of laying the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> before the Council of State, but abstained from doing so.

<p>It was not long, however, before he had to face an enormous difficulty: there were more than twenty <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> vacant, and <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> declared to <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Fesch</a>, to Caprara, and to Maury that, so long as he was a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, so long as he could not communicate freely with his natural counsellors, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, he would not provide for the institution of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Thus the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was partially suspended. In November, 1809, Napoleon appointed an "ecclesiastical council" to seek a solution of the difficulty. With <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Fesch</a> as president, this council included as members Cardinal Maury, Barral, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, Duvoisin, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>, Emery, Superior of S. Sulpice, Bishops Canaveri of <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>, Bourlier of <a href="../cathen/05671a.htm">Evreux</a>, Mannay of Tr&egrave;ves, and the <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabite</a> Fontana. Bigot de Pr&eacute;ameneu, in the name of the emperor, laid before the council several sets of questions relating to the affairs of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> in general, then to those of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and lastly to those of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">Excommunication</a>.

<p>In the preamble to its replies, the council gave voice to a petition for the absolute liberty of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the recall of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. It declared that if a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> were assembled for the settlement of the religious questions then pending, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> presence at the council would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and that a national council would not have sufficient authority in questions affecting the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It also declared that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> could not complain of any essential violation of the Concordat, that, when he advanced his temporal spoliation, as one reason for his refusal to institute the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> canonically, he was confounding the temporal order with the spiritual, that the temporal sovereignty was only an accessory of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority, that the invasion of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was not a violation of the Concordat, and that the national council would interpose an appeal from the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">Excommunication</a> either to the general council or to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> better informed. The manner in which <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> might be secured for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should continue his resistance, was twice discussed. Urged by the Government, the council admitted that, taking the circumstances into consideration, the conciliary institution given by a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> to his suffragans, or by the senior suffragan to a new <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, might possibly be recognized by a national council as, provisionally, a substitute for pontifical <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>. Emery, thinking the council too lenient, refused to endorse the answers, which were sent to Napoleon on 11 January, 1810.

<p>On 17 February, 1810, the Act regulating the Roman territory and future condition of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, introduced by R&eacute;gnault de Saint Jean d'Ang&eacute;ly, was passed unanimously by the senate. The <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, in accordance with this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, were to form two departments; from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which was declared the first city of the empire, the prince imperial was to take his title of king. The emperor, already <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> once at Notre Dame, was to go within ten years to be <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> at St. Peter's. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was to have a revenue of two millions. The empire was to charge itself with the maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation of Propaganda</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, on his accession, must promise to do nothing contrary to the four articles of the Gallican Church. Another Act of the Senate, of 25 February, 1810, made the Declaration of 1682 a general law of the empire. Thus did Napoleon flatter himself that he would reduce the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> to servitude and bring <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> to live in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He even prepared a letter to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> in which he told him: "I hold in execration the principles of the Bonifaces and the Gregorys. It is my mission to govern the West; do not meddle with it." This letter he would have had taken to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were to give notice to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> that in future the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> must swear allegiance to Napoleon, as of yore to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, and to inform him that he himself would be dispensed from this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, but that he must undertake not to reside at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Napoleon expected in this way to bend the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to his will. Wiser counsellors, however, prevailed upon him not to send this insulting letter. Nevertheless, to carry out his plan of removing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he ordered Miollis to compel all the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who were still at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to set out for <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and to have the Vatican archives transported thither. In 1810 there were twenty seven <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Roman cardinals</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; he lavished gifts upon them, invited them to the court festivals, and wished them to write and urge <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> to yield; but, following the advice of <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> refused.

<p>It was in the midst of these bitter conflicts with the church that, Napoleon desiring an heir, resolved to <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> Josephine. Ever since the end of 1807 <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich</a> had been aware of the reports that were current about the emperor's approaching <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>. On 12 December, 1807, Lucien Bonaparte had vainly endeavored to obtain from Josephine her consent to this <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>; some time after, Fouch&eacute; had made a similar attempt with no better success. In December, 1809, at Fontainebleau, in the presence of Prince Eug&egrave;ne, Josephine's son, the emperor induced her to consent; on 15 December, this was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> proclaimed in the throne room, in the presence of the Court, in an address delivered by Napoleon, and another read by the unhappy Josephine, who was prevented by her tears from finishing it. The Act of the Senate (16 December), based on a report of Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de, the naturalist, himself a member of the Senate, ratified the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>. Napoleon then thought of marrying the tsar's sister. But <a href="../cathen/10245a.htm">Metternich</a>, getting wind of this project, made Laborde and Schwarzenberg sound the Tuileries to see if Napoleon would marry an Austrian archduchess. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> pleased Napoleon. The Court of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, however, first required that the spiritual bond between Napoleon and Josephine should be severed.

<p>This bond the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> alone was competent to dissolve; Louis XII had had recourse to <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>; Henry IV to <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>; but Napoleon, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, could not apply to him. Cambac&eacute;r&egrave;s, the arch chancellor, sent for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> officials of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and explained to them that the marriage of Napoleon and Josephine had been invalid in consequence of the absence of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the two parties and of witnesses. In vain did they object that only the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> could decide such a case; they were told to commence proceedings, and be quick about it. On 26 December, the promoter of the case, Rudemare, begged Cambac&eacute;r&egrave;s to submit the matter to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> council over which <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Fesch</a> presided. On 2 January, 1810, Cambac&eacute;r&egrave;s sent a request to the official, Boislesve, for a declaration of nullity of the marriage, alleging, this time, that there had been absence of consent on Napoleon's part. On the next day the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> council replied that if the defect of Napoleon's consent could be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to the officiality, the marriage would be null and void. Cambac&eacute;r&egrave;s wished to produce <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Fesch</a>, Talleyrand, Duroc, and Berthier as witnesses. The testimony of <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Fesch</a> was very confused; he explained that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had given him the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the marriage; that two days later he had given Josephine a marriage certificate; that the emperor had then upbraided him, declaring to him that he (the emperor) had only agreed to this marriage in order to quiet the empress, and that it was, moreover, impossible for him to renounce his hopes of direct descendants. The other two witnesses told how Napoleon had repeatedly expressed the conviction that he was not bound by this marriage and that he regarded the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> only as "a mere concession to circumstances [<em>acte de pure circonstance</em>] which ought not to have any effect in the future".

<p>On 9 January the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> authorities declared the marriage null and void, on the ground of the absence of the lawful <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and of witnesses; it pronounced this decision only in view of the "difficulty in the way of having recourse to the visible head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to whom it has always belonged in fact to pronounce upon these extraordinary cases." The promoter Rudemare had concluded with the recommendation that the tribunal should at least lay a precept upon the two parties to repair the defect of form which had vitiated their marriage; Boilesve, the official, refrained from proffering this invitation. Rudemare then appealed to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> authorities on this point. On 12 January, 1810, the official, Lejeas, with much greater complaisance, admitted both the grounds of nullity advanced by Cambac&eacute;r&egrave;s &mdash; that is, not only the defect of form, but also the defect of the emperor's consent. He alleged that the <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">civil marriage</a> of Napoleon and Josephine had been annulled by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Senate, that by the concordatory <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> (<em>lois concordataires</em>) the religious marriage ought to follow the civil, and that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> could not now ask two parties who were no longer civilly married to repair the defects of form in their religious marriage. Thus, he declared, the marriage was religiously annulled. It may be noted here that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot be held responsible for the excessive complaisance shown in this matter by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> council and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> authorities of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. On 21 January, 1810, Napoleon resolved to ask for the hand of Marie Louise. The French ambassador at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, at the request of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, gave him his word of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> that the sentence pronounced by the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> authorities of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> was legal. At last all the religious obstacles to the celebration of the new marriage were disposed of.

<p>It took place on 1 April, 1810, but thirteen of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> then in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> refused to be present. These thirteen <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> were turned away when they presented themselves at the Tuileries two days later; the minister of public worship informed them that they were no longer <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, that they no longer had any right to wear the purple; the minister of police forwarded them, two by two, to small country towns; their pensions were suppressed, their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> sequestrated. People called them "the black cardinals". The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Roman States were treated with similar <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>; nineteen out of thirty two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> refused the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance to the emperor, and were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, while a certain number of non juring <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were interned in <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>, and the emperor announced his intention of reducing the number of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the Roman States by three fourths. This policy of bitter <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> coincided with fresh overtures to his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, through the Austrian diplomat Lebzeltern (May, 1810). <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII's</a> reply was that, to negotiate, he must be free and able to communicate with the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. In July Napoleon sent Cardinals Spina and Caselli to Savona, but they obtained nothing from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. There had been no solution of the internal crisis of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; while <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> was a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were not to receive <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a>. Bigot de Pr&eacute;ameneu and Maury suggested to the emperor a possible arrangement; to invite the chapter in each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to designate the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who had been nominated, but not yet canonically instituted, provisional administrator. <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Fesch</a> refused to lend himself to this expedient and occupy the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; but a certain number of nominated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> did go to their episcopal cities in the capacity of provisional administrators. Going one step further, Napoleon removed Maury from the <a href="../cathen/10529a.htm">See of Montefiascone</a>, and d'Osmond from that of <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a>, and had them designated by the respective chapters provisional administrators of the two vacant <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Florence. Maury and d'Osmond, at the emperor's bidding, left the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> given them by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to install themselves in these <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a>.

<p>Despite the rigour of his captivity, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> was able to make known the pontifical commands to Cardinal di Pietro at Semur; a secret agency at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, established by certain members of the Congregation, devised ingenious ways of facilitating these communications as well as the circulation of <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>. In November, 1810, the Court was stupefied with the news that two <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, addressed to the Chapters of Florence and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, forbade their recognizing D'Osmond and Maury. The imperial fury was let loose. On 1 January, 1811, Napoleon, during an audience to Maury and the canons, demanded an explanation from <a href="../cathen/02031a.htm">d'Astros</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a>, who had received the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, telling him that there is "as much difference between the religion of <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> and that of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> as between <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>"; <a href="../cathen/02031a.htm">d'Astros</a>, taken by Maury himself to police headquarters, was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at Vincennes. At the Council of State, 4 January, 1811, Portalis, a relative of <a href="../cathen/02031a.htm">d'Astros</a>, was openly accused of treason by Napoleon, and immediately put out of the council chamber (with a brutality that the emperor afterwards regretted) and was then ordered to quit <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Cardinals di Pietro, Oppizzone, and Gabrielli, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> Fontana and Gregori, former counsellors of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, were thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. Maury used his influence with the canons of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to induce them to apologize to Napoleon, who received them, told them that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> must not treat him as a <em>roi fain&eacute;ant</em>, and declared that, since the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was not acting up to the Concordat in the matter of institution of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the emperor, on his side, renounced the Concordat. The conditions of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> captivity were made more severe; all his correspondence had to pass through <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, to be inspected by the Government; the lock of his desk was picked; he could no longer receive visits without the presence of witnesses; a gendarme demanded of him the ring of St. Peter, which <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> surrendered after breaking it in two. Chabrol, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> custodian, showed him the addresses to which some of the chapters were expressing their submission to the emperor, but <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> was inflexible. A commission of jurisconsults in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, after discussing the possibility of a law regulating the <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> without the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> co operation, ended by deciding that to pass such a law was almost equivalent to <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>.

<p>Napoleon was not willing to go so far. He summoned the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> council which he had already established and, 8 February, 1811, proposed to it these two questions: (1) All communication between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the emperor's subjects being interrupted, to whom must recourse be had for the <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> ordinarily granted by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>? (2) What canonical means is there of providing institution for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> reuses it? <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Fesch</a> and Emery tried to sway the council towards some courses which would save the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> prerogative. But the majority of the council answered: (1) That recourse might be had, provisionally, to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> in question; 2) That a clause might be added to the Concordat stipulating that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> must grant <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> within a stated time; failing which, the right of institution would devolve upon the council of the province; and that, if the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> rejected this amendment of the <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">Concordat</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> would have to be revived so far as concerned <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The council added that, if the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> persisted in his refusal, the possibility of a public abolition of the Concordat by the emperor would have to be considered; but that these questions could be broached only by a national council, after one last attempt at negotiation with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>On 16 March, 1811, Napoleon summoned to the Tuileries the members of the council and several of the great dignitaries of the empire; inveighing bitterly against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he proclaimed that the Concordat no longer existed and that he was going to convoke a council of the West. At this meeting Emery, who died on 28 April, boldly faced Napoleon, quoting to him passages from <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> on the necessity of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> liberty. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> not yielding to a last summons on the part of Chabrol, the council was convoked on 25 April to meet on 9 June. By this step Napoleon expected to subdue the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to his will. In pursuance of a plan outlined by the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> <a href="../cathen/06465a.htm">Gerando</a>, Archbishop Barral, and Bishops Duvoisin and Mannay were sent to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> to gain him over on the question of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of institution. They were joined by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05751b.htm">Faenza</a>, and arrived at <a href="../cathen/13489c.htm">Savona</a> on 9 May. At first the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> refused to discuss the matter, not being free to communicate with his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and Chabrol insisted, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> physician added his efforts to theirs. They represented that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was becoming disorganized. At the end of nine days, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who was neither eating nor drinking anything, being very much fatigued, consented, not to ratify, but to take as "a basis of negotiation" a note drawn up by the four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to the purport that, in case of persistent refusal on his part, <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> might be given to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> after six months. On 20 May, at four o'clock in the morning, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> started for <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> with this note; at seven o'clock the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> summoned Chabrol and told him that he did not accept the note in any definitive sense, that he considered it only a sketch, and that he had made no formal promise. He also asked that a courier should be sent after the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to warn them of this. The courier bearing this message overtook the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a> on 24 May. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> warned Chabrol that if the first note were exploited as representing an arrangement definitely accepted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he "would make a noise that should resound through the whole <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a>". Napoleon, in his blindness, resolved to do without the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and put all his hopes in the council.
<h3>Council of 1811</h3>

<p>The council convoked for 9 June, 1811, was not opened at Notre Dame until 17 June, the opening being postponed on account of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the King of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, just born of Marie Louise. Paternal <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and the seemingly assured destinies of his throne rendered Napoleon still more inflexible in regard to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Only since 1905 has the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about this council been known, thanks to Welschinger's researches. Under the Second Empire, when D'Haussonville wrote his work on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and the First Empire (see below) Marshal Vallant had refused him all access to the archives of the council. These archives Welsinger was able to consult. Boulogne, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, in his opening sermon affirmed the solidarity of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, while <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Fesch</a>, as president of the council, made all its members swear obedience and fidelity to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>. Upon this Napoleon gave <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Fesch</a> a sound rating, on the evening of 19 June, at <a href="../cathen/13342a.htm">Saint Cloud</a>. The emperor had packed his council in very arbitrary fashion, choosing only 42 out of 150 <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to mix with the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, with a view to ecumenical effect. A private bulletin sent to the emperor, 24 June, noted that the fathers of the council themselves were generally impressed with a sense of restraint. The opposition to the emperor was very firmly led by Broglie, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, seconded by Aviau, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, Dessole, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03566c.htm">Chamb&eacute;ry</a>, and Hirn, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>. The first general assembly of the council was held on 20 June. Bigot de Pr&eacute;ameneu and Marescalchi, <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of public worship for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, were present and read the imperial message, one draft of which had been rejected by Napoleon as too moderate. The final version displeased all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had any regard for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> dignity. Napoleon in this document demanded that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should be instituted in accordance with the forms which had obtained before the Concordat, no see to be vacant for longer than three months, "more than sufficient time for appointing a new incumbent". He wished the council to present an address to him, and the committee that should prepare this address to be composed of the four <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> he had sent to Savona. The address, which was prepared in advance by Duvoisin, one of these four <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, was an expression of assent to Napoleon's wishes. But the council decided to have on the committee besides these four <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, some other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> chosen by secret ballot, and among the latter figured Broglie. Broglie discussed Duvoisin's draft and had a number of changes made in it, and <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Fesch</a> had some trouble in keeping the committee from at once demanding the liberation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The address, as voted, was nonsensical. It was not what Napoleon expected, and the audience which he was to have given to the members of the council on 30 June, did not take place.

<p>Another committee was appointed by the council to inquire into the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> views on the institution of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. After a conflict of ten days, Broglie secured against Duvoisin, by a vote of 8 to 4, a resolution to the effect that, in this matter, nothing must be done without the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and that the council ought to send him a deputation to learn what was his will. Napoleon was furious and said to <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Fesch</a> and Barral: "I will dissolve the council. You are a pack of fools". Then, on second thought, he informed the council that <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> by way of concession, had formally promised <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> to the vacant <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and had approved a clause enabling the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> themselves in future, after six months vacancy of any see, to give <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a>. Napoleon requested the council to issue a note to this effect and sent a deputation to thank the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. First the committee voted as the emperor wished, then, on more mature consideration, suspecting some stratagem on the emperor's part, it recalled its vote, and, on 10 July, Hirn, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, speaking for the committee, proposed to the council that no decision be made until a deputation had been sent to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Then, on the morning of 11 July, Napoleon pronounced the council dissolved. The following night Broglie, Hirn, and Boulogne were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at Vincennes. The emperor next thought of turning over the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> to the prefects, but presently took the advice of Maury, viz., to have all the members of the council called up, one by one, by the minister of public worship, and their personal assent to the imperial project obtained in this way. After fifteen days devoted to conversations between the minister and certain of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the emperor reconvoked the council for 5 August, and the council, by a vote of 80 to 13, passed the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> by which <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> was to be given within six months, either by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or, if he refused, by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who passed this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> tried to palliate their weakness by saying that they had no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of committing an act of rebellion, but formally asked for, and hoped to obtain, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> assent. Napoleon believed himself victorious; he held in his hands the means of circumventing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and organizing without his co operation the administration of French and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. He had brought the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, the Dataria, the Penitentiary, and the Vatican Archives to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and had spent several millions in improving the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace which he meant to make the pontifical palace. He wished to remove the H&ocirc;tel Dieu, install the departments of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> in its place, and make the quarter of Notre Dame and the Isle de Saint Louis the capital of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. But his victory was only apparent: to make the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the national council valid, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> ratification was needed, and once more the resistance of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> was to hold the emperor in check.

<p>On 17 August Napoleon commissioned the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> and <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/05671a.htm">Evreux</a>, <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, Feltro, and <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> to go to Savona and demand of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> his full adhesion to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 5 August; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were even to be precise in stating that the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> applied to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> in the former <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, so that, in giving his assent, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> should by implication assent to the abolition of the temporal power. That <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> might not allege the absence of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> as a reason for postponing his decisions, Napoleon sent to Savona five <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> on whom he could rely (Roverella, Dugnani, Fabrizio Ruffo, Bayanne, and Doria) with instructions to support the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The emperor's artifice was successful. On 6 September, 1811, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> declared himself ready to yield, and charged Roverella to draw up a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> approving the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 5 August, and on 20 September the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> signed the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>. But even then, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> as it was, was not what Napoleon wanted: <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> abstained from recognizing the council as a national council, he treated the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as the mistress of all the Churches, and did not specify that the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> applied to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> of the Roman States; he also required that, when a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> gave <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a>, it should be given in the name of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Napoleon did not publish the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>. On 17 October he ordered the deputation of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> to notify the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> that the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> applied equally to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> in the Roman States. This interpretation <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> then formally repudiated, and announced once more that any further decision on his part would be postponed until he should have with him a suitable number of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. Napoleon first wreaked his irritation on the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, and Troyes, whom he forced to resign their sees and caused to be deported to various towns, then, on 3 December, he declared the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> unacceptable, and charged the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> to ask for another. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> refused.

<p>On 9 January, 1812, the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> informed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, from the emperor, that, if the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> resisted any longer, the emperor would act on his own discretion in the matter of the institution of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> sent a personal reply to the emperor, to the effect that he (the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>) needed a more numerous council and facility of communication with the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and that he would then do, "to meet the emperor's wishes, all that was consistent with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his Apostolic ministry." By way of rejoinder, Napoleon dictated to his minister of public worship, on 9 February, an extraordinarily vehement letter, addressed to the deputation of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. In it he refused to give <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> his liberty or to let the "black cardinals" go back to him; he made known that if the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> persisted in the refusal to govern the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they would do without the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; and he advised the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in insulting terms, to abdicate. Chabrol, the prefect of Montenotte, read this letter to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, and advised him to surrender the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a>. "Never", was the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> answer. Then on 23 February, Chabrol notified the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in the emperor's name, that Napoleon considered the Concordats abrogated, and that he would no longer permit the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to interfere in any way in the <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> answered that he would not change his attitude. Mme de Sta&euml;l wrote to Henri Meister: "What a power is religion which gives strength to the weak when all that was strong has lost its strength!" The difference between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the emperor naturally reacted upon the feelings of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> towards Napoleon, and upon the emperor's policy towards religion. From this time Napoleon refused the seminarists any exemption from military service. He made stricter the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> monopoly of teaching, and Broglie, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, who, after leaving the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of Vincennes, had continued to correspond with his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, was sent to the Island of Sainte Marguerite.
<h3>Last great wars: Concordat of Fontainebleau</h3>

<p>At this time Napoleon was absolutely drunk with power. The French Empire had 130 departments; the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a> 240. The seven provinces of <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a> were subject to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The rigour of the Continental blockade was ruining English commerce and embarrassing the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> states. The tsar would have liked Napoleon, master of the West, to leave him freedom of action in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and Turkey; enraged at receiving no such concessions, he approached <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The French armies in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> were exhausting their strength in a savage and ineffectual <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against a ceaseless uprising of the native population; nevertheless Napoleon resolved to attack <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> also. At Dresden, from March to June, 1812, he held a congress of kings, and prepared for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. It was at <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>, in May, 1812, that, under pretext of satisfying the demands of Francis Joseph for gentler treatment of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Napoleon decided to have <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> removed from <a href="../cathen/13489c.htm">Savona</a> to Fontainebleau; the fact is that he was afraid the English would attempt a <em>coup de main</em> on Savona and carry off the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. After a journey the painful incidents of which have been related by d'Haussonville, following a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in the British Museum, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> reached Fontainebleau on 19 June. Equipages were placed at his disposal, he was desired to appear in public and officiate; but he refused, led a solitary life in the interior of the palace, and gave not the least indication of being ready to yield to Napoleon's demands.

<p>Napoleon definitely declared <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the tsar on 22 June, 1812. The issue was soon seen to be dubious. The <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a> devastated the whole country in advance of the French armies, and avoided pitched battles as much as possible. The victory of Borodino (7 September, 1812), an extremely bloody one, opened to Napoleon the gates of <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> (14 September, 1812). He had expected to pass the winter there, but the conflagration brought about by the Russians forced him to retrace his steps westward, and the retreat of the "Grande Arm&eacute;e" so heroically covered by Marshall Ney, cost <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the lives of numberless soldiers. The passage of the Beresina was glorious. As far as Lithuania, Napoleon shared the sufferings of his army, then he hastened to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he suppressed General Malet's conspiracy and prepared a new <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> for the year 1813. When he set out for <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> it was his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> to extend his march beyond that country, through <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, to knock over "the scaffolding of mercantile greatness raised by the English, and strike <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to the heart". "After this", he declared, "it will be possible to settle everything and have done with this business of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> will become that of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world. . . . If <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> were living now, he would have been <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> long ago, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> would still be at the Vatican, which would be much better for everybody, for then there would be no pontifical throne higher than that of Notre Dame, and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> could not fear <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. With such a president, I would hold a <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> in Gaul."

<p>But the failure of the Russian campaign upset all these dreams. The emperor's haughty attitude towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was now modified. On 29 December, 1812, he wrote with his own hand an affectionate letter to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> expressing a desire to end the quarrel. Duvoisin was sent to Fontainebleau to negotiate a Concordat. Napoleon's demands were these: the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> must swear to do nothing against the four articles; he must condemn the behaviour of the black cardinals towards the emperor; he must allow the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sovereigns to chose two thirds of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, take up his residence in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, accept the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the council on the <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and agree to its application to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> of the Roman States. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> spent ten days discussing the matter. On 18 January, 1813, the emperor himself came to Fontainebleau and spent many days in stormy interviews with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> though, according to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII's</a> own statement to Count Paul Van der Vrecken, on 27 September, 1814, Napoleon committed no act of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. On 25 January, 1813, a new Concordat was signed. In it there was no mention either of the Four Articles, or of the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sovereigns, or of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> place of residence: the six suburbican <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were left at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> disposition, and he could moreover provide directly for ten <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, either in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> or in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> &mdash; on all these points Napoleon made concessions. But on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> confirmed the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Council of 1811 on the <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p>According to the very words of its preamble, this Concordat was intended only "to serve as basis for a definitive arrangement". But, on 13 February, Napoleon had it published, just as it stood, as a law of the State. This was very unfair towards <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>: the emperor had no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to convert "preliminary articles" thus into a definitive act. On 9 February the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> had been liberated by Napoleon; going to Fontainebleau, they had found <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> very anxious on the subject of the signature he had given, and which he regretted. With the advice of <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a>, he prepared to retract the "preliminary articles". In his letter of 24 March to Napoleon he reproached himself for having signed these articles and disavowed the signature he had given. Napoleon had failed egregiously. He did not listen to the advice of the Comte de Narbonne, who, in a letter drafted by young Villemain, expressed the opinion that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ought to be set at liberty and sent back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It has been claimed that Napoleon had said to his <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of State: "If I don't knock the head off the shoulders of some of those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at Fontainebleau, matters will never be arranged." This is a legend; on the contrary, he ordered the minister of public worship to keep secret the letter of 24 March. Immediately, acting on his own authority, he declared the Concordat of Fontainebleau binding on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and filled twelve vacant <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. On 5 April he had Cardinal di Pietro removed from Fontainebleau and threatened to do the same for <a href="../cathen/11380b.htm">Cardinal Pacca</a>.

<p>In the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, and Tournai, the chapters regarded the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> appointed by Napoleon as intruders. The irregular measures of the emperor only exasperated the resistance of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, warned by Count Van der Vrecken of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> retractation, began to agitate against the imperial policy. Meanwhile, on 25 April, 1813, Napoleon assumed command of the Army of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The victories of Lutzen (2 May) and Bautzen (19 22 May) weakened the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> and Russian troops. But the emperor made the mistakes of accepting the mediation of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> &mdash; only a device to gain time &mdash; and of consenting to hold the Congress of Prague (July). A letter from <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, secretly carried in the face of many dangers by Van der Vrecken, warned the Congress of Prague that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> formally rejected the articles of 25 January. Napoleon continued nevertheless to send from his headquarters with the army severe orders calculated to overcome the resistance of the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; on 6 August he caused the director of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> to be <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, and all the students to be taken to Magdeburg; on 14 August he had the canons of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> arrested. But his perils were increasing. Joseph had been driven out of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Bernadotte, King of Sweden, one of Napoleon's own veterans, was driving the french troops out of Stralsund. Under Schwarzenberg, Bl&uuml;cher and Bernadotte, three armies were forming against the emperor. He had but 280,000 men against 500,000. He was victor at <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a> (27 August), but his generals were falling away on all sides. He was deserted by the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> contingents in the celebrated "Battle of the Nations" at Leipzig (18 19 October), the defection of the <a href="../cathen/15716b.htm">W&uuml;rtembergers</a> and the Saxons was the chief cause of his defeat. The victories of Hanau (30 October) and Hocheim (2 November) enabled his troops to get back to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but the Allies were soon to enter that land.
<h3>Liberation of the pope: end of the empire</h3>

<p>The liberation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> figured on the programme of the Allies. In vain did the emperor send the Marchesa di Brignoli to <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a>, and Fallot de Beaumont, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, to open negotiations. In vain, on 18 January, 1814, when he learned that Murat had gone over to the Allies and occupied the Roman provinces on his own account, did he offer to restore the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a> to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> declared that such a restitution was an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and could not be made the subject of a treaty. Meantime, Bl&uuml;cher and Schwarzenberg were advancing through <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. On 24 January, Lagorse, the commandant of gendarmes who had guarded <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> for four years, announced to him that he was about to take him back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was conveyed by short stages through southern and central <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Napoleon defeated the Allies at Saint Dizier and at Brienne (27 29 January, 1814), the princes offered peace on condition that Napoleon should restore the boundaries of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to what they were in 1792. He refused. As the Allies demanded the liberation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Napoleon sent orders to Lagorse, who was taking him through the south of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, to let him make his way to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. On 10 March the prefect of Montenotte received orders to have the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> conducted as far as the Austrian outposts in the territory of <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>. The captivity of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> was at an end.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was resumed immediately after the Congress of Chatillon. In five days Napoleon gave battle to Bl&uuml;cher four times at Champaubert, Montmirail, Chateau Thierry, and Vauchamp, and hurled him back on <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>; against Schwarzenberg he fought the battles of Guiges, Mormant, Nangis, and M&eacute;ry, thus opening the way to Troyes. But Lyons was taken by the Austrians, <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> by the English. Exhausted as he was Napoleon beat Bl&uuml;cher again at Craonne (7 March), retook <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> and Epernay, and contemplated cutting off the retreat of Bl&uuml;cher and Schwarzenberg on the Rhine. He caused a general levy to be decreed; but the Allies had their agents in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Marmont and Mortier capitulated. On 31 March the Allies entered <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. On 3 April the Senate declared Napoleon dethroned. Returning to Fontainebleau, the emperor, determined to try one last effort, was stopped by the defection of Marmont's corps at Essonnes. On 20 April he left Fontainebleau; on 4 May he was in <a href="../cathen/05371c.htm">Elba</a>.

<p>At the end of ten months, learning of the unpopularity of the regime founded in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by Louis XVIII, Napoleon secretly left <a href="../cathen/05371c.htm">Elba</a>, landed at Cannes (1 March, 1815), and went in triumph from <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a> to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (20 March, 1815). Louis VIII fled to Ghent. Then began the Hundred Days. Napoleon desired to give <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> liberty and religious peace forthwith. On the one hand, by the <em>Acte Additionnel</em>, he guaranteed the country a constitutional Government; on the other hand (4 April, 1815), he caused the Duke of <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> to write to <a href="../cathen/11380b.htm">Cardinal Pacca</a>, and he himself wrote to <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, letters in a pacific spirit, while Isoard, auditor of the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a>, was commissioned to treat with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in his name. But the Coalition was re formed. Napoleon had 118,000 recruits against more than 800,000 soldiers; he beat Bl&uuml;cher at Ligny (16 June), whilst Ney beat <a href="../cathen/15580a.htm">Wellington</a> at Quatre Bras; next day, at Waterloo, Napoleon was victorious over B&uuml;low and Wellington until seven o'clock in the evening, but the arrival of 30,000 <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussians</a>, under Bl&uuml;cher, resulted in the emperor's defeat. He abdicated in favour of his son, set out for Rochefort, and claimed the hospitality of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> declared him the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> of the Coalition and, in spite of his protests, had him taken to the Island of St. Helena. There he remained until his death, strictly watched by Hudson Lowe, and dictated to General Montholon, Gourgaud, and Bertrand those "M&eacute;moires" which entitle him to a place among the great writers. <a href="../cathen/03397a.htm">Las Casas</a>, at the same time, wrote day by day, the "M&eacute;morial de Sainte H&eacute;l&egrave;ne", a journal of the emperor's conversations. In the first of his captivity, Napoleon complained to Montholon of having no <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>. "It would rest my soul to hear Mass", he said. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> petitioned <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to accede to Napoleon's wish, and the Abb&eacute; Vignali became his <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>. On 20 April, 1821, Napoleon said to him: "I was born in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. I wish to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> it imposes, and receive the succour it administers." To Montholon he affirmed his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, read aloud the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the Gospels, and the acts of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. He spoke of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> as "an old man full of tolerance and light". "Fatal circumstances," he added "embroiled our cabinets. I regret it exceedingly." Lord Rosebery has attached much importance to the paradoxes with which the emperor used to tease Gourgaud, and amused himself in maintaining the superiority of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialism</a>. One day, when he had been talking in this strain, Montholon said to him: "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that your Majesty does not believe one word of what you have just been saying". "You are right", said the emperor. "At any rate it helps to pass an hour."

<p>Napoleon was not an unbeliever; but he would not admit that anyone was above himself, not even the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. "Alexander the great", he once said to Fontanes, "declared himself the son of Jupiter. And in my time I find a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who is more powerful than I am." This transcendent <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> dictated his religious policy and utterly vitiated it. By the Concordat, as Talleyrand said, he had "done not only an act of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but also a very clever act, for by this one deed he had rallied to himself the sympathies of the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world." But the same Talleyrand declares, in his "M&eacute;moires", that his struggle with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was produced by "the most insensate ambition", and that when he wished to deprive the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of the institution of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, "he was all the more culpable because he had had before him the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the Constituent Assembly". This double judgment of the former Constitutional <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, later the emperor's minister of foreign affairs, will be accepted by posterity. By a strange destiny, this emperor who travelled all over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and whose attitude towards the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion was in a measure inherited from the old Roman emperors, never set foot in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; through him <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was for many years deprived of the presence of the remotest successor of St. Sylvester and of <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a>; but the successor of Constantine and of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> did not see <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> did not see him.
