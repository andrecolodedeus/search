<p>UNITED DIOCESES OF NARNI AND TERNI (NARNIENSIS ET INTERAMNENSIS)

<p>Located in Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Narni is the ancient Nequinum of the Sabines; in 300 and 299 B.C., it was besieged by the Romans, who destroyed the city and sent there a Latin colony, changing the name to Narnia. Luitprand captured the town in 726, but <a href="../cathen/15743b.htm">Pope Zacharias</a> persuaded him to restore it to the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 742, after which it remained under pontifical rule. From 1198 to 1214, Narni was in rebellion against <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, who temporarily suppressed its <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. The churches of this city contain many <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of the ancient Umbrian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. This town is the birthplace of the Blessed Lucia of <a href="../cathen/10704a.htm">Narni</a>, a tertiary of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">St. Dominic</a>, who died in 1544, and of the <em>condottiere</em> Erasmo Gattamelata. Narni venerates as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Juvenalis, who died in the second half of the fourth century; St. Maximus, who was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 425, was succeeded by his two sons Hercules and Pancratius; <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> refers to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> St. Cassius, who died in 558; the same pontiff wrote a letter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Projectinus which shows that, at Narni, at that time, there were still <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> to be converted; Bishop John (940) was succeeded by his son, who became <a href="../cathen/08427a.htm">John XIII</a>; among other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: William, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a> employed against the Fraticelli (1367); and Raimondo Castelli (1656), founder of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>.

<p>In 1908, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/10704a.htm">Narni</a> and of Terni were united. Terni is on the river Nera, at its confluence with the Velino; the magnificent cascade of the latter is well-known through the noble description by Lord Byron in "Childe Harold". Terni is the ancient Interamna Nahars of the Umbrians, and its former splendour is witnessed to by the ruins of an amphitheatre in the garden of the episcopal palace, a theatre, and baths near the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Nicholas. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and other churches, are built on the sites of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>. After the Lombard invasion, Terni belongs to the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, and with the latter, came into the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>; it was at this town that <a href="../cathen/15743b.htm">Pope Zacharias</a> entered into the agreement with King Luitprand for the restitution of the cities of Bieda, Orte, Bomarzo, and Amelia to the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It is believed that the gospel was preached at Terni by St. Peregrinus, about the middle of the second century. The townsmen have great veneration for St. Valentinus, whose basilica is outside the city, and was, probably, the meeting-place of the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Terni. There were other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> from this city among them, Sts. Proculus, Ephebus, Apollonius, and the holy virgin Agape. In the time of Totila, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Terni, St. Proculus, was killed at Bologna, and St. Domnina and ten <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, her companions, were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> at Terni itself. After the eighth century Terni was without a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> until 1217, in which year the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was re-established. Among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> since that time, were Ludovico Mazzanco III (1406), who governed the diocese for fifty-two years; Cosmas Manucci (1625), who gave the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and Francesco Rapaccioli (1646), a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> who restore the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The united <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> are immediately dependent upon <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; they have 57 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with 66,600 inhabitants, 3 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men, and 11 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.
