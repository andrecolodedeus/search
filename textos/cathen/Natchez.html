<p>DIOCESE OF NATCHEZ (NATCHESIENSIS)

<p>Established 28 July, 1837; comprises the <a href="../cathen/10394a.htm">State of Mississippi</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionary work in this territory began with the expeditions of Marquette, La Salle, and Iberville. Iberville planted a colony in the home of the Natchez tribe, and erected there Fort Rosalie, on a site within the present city of Natchez. <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> laboured in this field, having missions at Biloxi, Natchez, and <a href="../cathen/15732d.htm">Yazoo</a>. Early in the history of the missions, Fathers St. Cosme and Foucault, seculars, were <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the Indians, as were the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> Du Poisson, Souart, and Senat. In 1787 three <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from Salamanca, Fathers McKenna, White, and Savage, settled at Natchez and erected promising missions there and in the vicinity. When the territory passed from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, these missions were practically abandoned. Much valuable <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was lost to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the efforts made to recover it were in vain. For many years the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Natchez depended upon chance visits of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Natchez, John Mary Joseph Chanche, was b. 4 Oct., 1795, at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, whither his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> had fled from <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">San Domingo</a>. He joined the <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, and was president of Mount St. Mary's when appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 14 March, 1841. Arriving at Natchez, he met there the only <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the state, Father Brogard, who was there but temporarily. Taking up the role of a simple missionary, he began to collect the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and organize a diocese. In 1842 he laid the corner stone of the present beautiful <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and opened an academy for girls. In 1818 he invited the Sisters of Charity to Natchez. At the First Plenary Council, in 1852, Bishop Chanche was chief promoter. He died shortly after the sessions of the Council, at Frederick, Md., leaving his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> with 11 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 11 churches erected, and 13 attendant missions. James Oliver Van de Velde was transferred from <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> to Natchez, 29 July, 1853. He served the diocese but two years. On 23 Oct., 1853, he broke his leg, and a fever set in which quickly developed into yellow fever; he died 13 Nov., 1855. Bishop Van de Velde was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/05373a.htm">William Henry Elder</a>. The next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Francis Janssens, was b. at Tillburg, North Branbant, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, studied at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> 21 Dec., 1867. In 1870, he was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a>, Virginia, and later <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> under Bishops Gibbons and Keane. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Natchez, 1 May, 1881., and promoted to be <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, 7 August, 1888. Thomas Heslin was b. in County Longford, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1847, and on the completion of his classical studies, came to America at the invitation of <a href="../cathen/11208a.htm">Archbishop Odin</a>. He entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Bouligny, <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1869, and was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Michael's, <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, when he received his appointment as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Natchez. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1889.

<p>The religious institutes represented (1910) in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers; Josephite Fathers (three charges); <a href="../cathen/05054a.htm">Fathers of the Society of the Divine Word</a> (three charges); <a href="../cathen/13305a.htm">Brothers of the Sacred Heart</a>, (six charges); Sisters of Charity (Emmitsburg); <a href="../cathen/10724c.htm">Sisters of Charity (Nazareth)</a>; <a href="../cathen/11698b.htm">Sisters of the Perpetual Adoration</a>; Sisters of St. Francis; Sisters of St Joseph; sisters of Mercy; School Sisters of Notre Dame; Sisters Marianites of the Holy Cross; Sisters of the Holy Ghost.
