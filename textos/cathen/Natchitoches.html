<h1>Natchitoches</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of Natchitoches

<p>Former title of the present <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Diocese of Alexandria</a> (Alexandrinensis), which comprises all the northern part of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> above 31&#176; N. lat., with an area of 22,212 square miles. The <a href="../cathen/09657b.htm">Venerable Antonio Margil</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> is in process, was the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to minister within the territory now forming the diocese. From the Ays Indians, west of the Sabine river, <a href="../cathen/09657b.htm">Father Margil</a> heard of the Adayes Indians, and in March, 1717, he located them near Spanish Lake, in what is now Sabine county, La. He founded the mission of San Miguel de Linares and built there probably the first church in <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, for, according to the historian Martin, when Pere Charlevoix reached <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> in 1721, he found there "about 100 cabins, two or three dwelling houses, and a miserable storehouse which had been at first occupied as a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, a shed being now used for that purpose". Leaving Father Gusman in charge, <a href="../cathen/09657b.htm">Father Margil</a> journeyed on foot to Natchitoches to minister to the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> there, and then went back to <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>. In 1718, during the brief <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, St. Denis, the French Cmnmandant at Natchitoches, invaded the Adayes mission, plundered it, and carried away the church vestments. <a href="../cathen/09657b.htm">Father Margil</a> heard of it, and in 1721 came back, hunted up the Adayes who had taken refuge in the forests for fear of the French, rebuilt their church, which he dedicated to our Lady of the Pillar, the patroness of the expedition. For many years afterwards the Adayes mission was attended from <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who attended also the missions of Nacogdoches and St. Augustin, <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>. In 1725 there were 50 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> at Natchitoches. In 1728 Father Maximin, a <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>, was in charge.

<p>There is no record to show how the eastern portion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was evangelized; the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> names, however, given to villages and lakes contiguous to the Mississippi, show that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> must have visited that country, probably the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who in the eighteenth century had charge of the Indians along the Mississippi under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec. The records show that in 1829 Father Martin of Avoyelles attended the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> on the Red, Black, and Ouachita rivers; that, in 1840 and after, Father J. Timon, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, made regular trips from <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> to attend the north Louisiana missions, and that Father O'Brien, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> from <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, attended yearly the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> along the Mississippi. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> located on the rivers of the state often drifted to <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> on barges to have their marriages blessed and their children <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and come back cordelling their boats.

<p>In 1852 the Fathers of the First Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> recommended to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the division of the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, the formation of the Diocese of Natchitoches and the appointment of Father Martin, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at Natchitoches, as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Consecrated in 1853, he had four <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the new diocese, three of whom returned to <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, to which diocese they belonged, and one remained.

<p>Bishop Augustus M. Martin (1802-1875), born in Brittany, inherited the deep <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Bretons. A protege of <a href="../cathen/08765a.htm">Abbe Jean-Marie de Lamennais</a>, as a seminarian, he was employed at the great Almonry of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> under Cardinal Prince de Troy and <a href="../cathen/08765a.htm">Vicar-General J.-M. de Lamennais</a>. There he came in contact with <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a> and other disciples of <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Felicite Lamennais</a>, and acquired the polished manners that never left him. In 1839, while <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the royal college in <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a>, he met Bishop de la Haylandiere of Vincennes, came to <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a> with him, and for six years was his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. His health failing, he came to <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, and in 1852 was <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of Mgr Blanc of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>. Bishop Martin left a collection of unpublished letters that tell interestingly the history of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, his struggles with poverty, his many trips to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to recruit his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. A fluent writer, his letters to the Propagation of the Faith were inserted in the "Annals"; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Second Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> and those of the provincial Council of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> delegated him to write letters of thanks to the directors of the Propagation of the Faith for their generous contributions. Both letters were reproduced in "Les Missions Catholiques". Bishop Martin left; an organized diocese with 20 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the Sisters of the Sacred Heart with one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, at, Natchitoches, and the <a href="../cathen/16030b.htm">Daughters of the Cross</a> with their mother-house and several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in the diocese.

<p>He was succeeded by Bishop F. X. Leray, also a Breton, the hero of several yellow fever epidemics, and the founder of the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">Diocese of Natchez</a>. He remained in Natchitoches only two years, being selected as coadjutor to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>. He died in 1887.

<p>Bishop Anthony Durier succeeded him. Born near <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he came to this country in 1855, was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> in <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> for 26 years, and one of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the Second Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. Consecrated in 1885, he died in 1904, having finished the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and built an episcopal residence at Natchi-toches.

<p>The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Right Rev. Cornelius Van De Ven, born at Oirschot, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, 16 June, 1865. He studied in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Bois-lc-Duc, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> 31 May, 1890, and came to America the same year. After filling important posts in the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Natchitoches 30 Nov., 1904. The most important act of his administration has been the transferring of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> from the inaccessible town of Natchitoches to the progressive city of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, a railroad centre with a large <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population. He went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1910 and requested <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> for the removal of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. In August 1910, he received from the Consistorial Congregation the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> suppressing the See of Natchitoches and creating the <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">See of Alexandria</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">See of Alexandria</a> numbers 26 <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 10 regulars (<a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a>), the <a href="../cathen/13305a.htm">Brothers of the Sacred Heart</a>, the <a href="../cathen/16030b.htm">Daughters of the Cross</a> with mothcr-house at Shreveport, the Sisters of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, and the Sisters of the Incarnate Word, with a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of about; 32,431.
