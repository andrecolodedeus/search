<h1>Nathan</h1>  

<p>Nathan (God-given), the name of several <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Nathan, successor of Samuel and prophet in the times of David and Solomon</h2>

<p>No indication is given as to his origin, and he appears in the narrative for the first time when <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> is contemplating the erection of a house to the Lord (<a href="../bible/2sa007.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>). He assures the monarch of the Lord's support and of the divinely <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> establishment of his kingdom for all time, but dissuades him from the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of building the proposed temple, stating that this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> was reserved for his son and successor (<a href="../bible/2sa007.htm#vrs13">2 Samuel 7:13</a>; <a href="../bible/1ch017.htm#vrs1">1 Chronicles 17:1-15</a>). Nathan appears later to reproach <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> in the name of the Lord for his crime of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> narrated in <a href="../bible/2sa011.htm">2 Samuel 11</a>, and, after skilfully proposing the allegory of the poor man's little ewe lamb, surprises the king with the words: "Thou art the man". He then declares the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of the Lord and the punishments that are to fall upon <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, although in view of the latter's repentance his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is pronounced forgiven, for his crimes had given occasion to the enemies of the Lord to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> (<a href="../bible/2sa012.htm#vrs1">2 Samuel 12:1-15</a>). The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> next appears on the scene when it is question of securing to Solomon the succession to the throne of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. Adonias, abetted by Joab and the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> Abiathar, made an attempt to have himself proclaimed king. The plan was frustrated by Nathan who, first through Bethsabee and later in a personal interview, informed <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> as to the doings of Adonias, and persuaded the aged monarch to confirm his promise in favour of Solomon and have him proclaimed king at the fountain of Gihon (<a href="../bible/1ki001.htm#vrs8">1 Kings 1:8-45</a>). In this instance Nathan served the interests of the country as well as those of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and Solomon by averting a civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. He is credited by the Chronicler with having written a part of the history of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, together with Samuel the seer and <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">Gad</a> the seer (<a href="../bible/1ch029.htm#vrs29">1 Chronicles 29:29</a>; <a href="../bible/2ch029.htm#vrs25">2 Chronicles 29:25</a>). The time of Nathan's death is not given, but his name is mentioned in <a href="../bible/sir047.htm#vrs1">Sirach 47:1</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Nathan, son of David and Bethsabee (2 Samuel 5:14; 1 Chronicles 3:5 and 14:4)</h2>

<p>The name Nathan augmented by the theophorous prefix or suffix is borne by other members of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>. Thus one of his brothers was Nathanael (<a href="../bible/1ch002.htm#vrs14">1 Chronicles 2:14</a>), and one of his nephews, Jonathan (<a href="../bible/2sa021.htm#vrs21">2 Samuel 21:21</a>).
<h2 id="section3">Nathan, father of Azarias and Zabud, important functionaries of the court of Solomon (1 Kings 4:5)</h2>

<p>By some scholars he is identified with Nathan the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> (1), and by others with Nathan the son of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> (2). Both opinions are merely conjectural. His son Zabud is designated as "priest", this being an indication, among many others, that the functions of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> were not at that period exercised exclusively by the descendants of Aaron.
<h2 id="section4">Nathan, son of Ethei and father of Zabad (1 Chronicles 2:36), of the tribe of Juda and of the branch of Caleb</h2>

<p>His grandfather Jeraa was an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> to whom Sesan gave one of his daughters in marriage (<a href="../bible/1ch002.htm#vrs34">1 Chronicles 2:34-35</a>).
<h2 id="section5">Nathan, one of the prominent Jews of the time of the captivity</h2>

<p>Chosen by Esdras together with several others to find levites for the temple service when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were camped on the banks of the Ahava preparing to return to Palestine (<a href="../bible/ezr008.htm#vrs16">Ezra 8:16</a>).
<h2 id="section6">Nathan, one of the sons of Bani mentioned in Ezra 10:39</h2>

<p>He was among those who, at the command of Esdras, put away the foreign wives they had married.
