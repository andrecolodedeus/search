<h1>National Synods</h1>  

<p>According to the recent canon law, national councils are the deliberating assemblies at which all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of a nation are convoked by the patriarch or <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> (Cf. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, "De Synodo", I, i), but, in order to include the ancient national synods, it would be more correct to say a legitimate assemblage of the episcopate of a nation, the decisions of which are valid for an entire national Church. For the classic definition is far from being applicable to all the ancient national councils, as it is difficult to apply to all recognized ecumenical councils the present classic definition and conditions for such councils.

<p>Councils are commonly divided into general or ecumenical, or particular; the latter are subdivided into national and provincial according as they assemble the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of a whole nation or of an <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>. Finally come the assemblies of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which are called <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> rather than councils. But writers point out that this classification is not and cannot be very exact. For instance, to what category belongs the <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a> of 314, at which Constantine in agreement with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> convoked all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or at least a representation, of the whole episcopate of his empire at that time? So also if we agree with most authors in regarding as national councils the assemblies of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">African</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, it may be objected that <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> did not form a distinct nation in the Roman Empire. On the other hand there have been councils which, while they did not assemble all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of a nation, may nevertheless be regarded as real national synods; such were the reform assemblies held at the command of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> in 814 simultaneously at Arles, <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;lons</a>. Moreover, if in order to be national a council must be presided over by a patriarch or <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, we must remove from the list of national councils nearly all the episcopal assemblies of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Kingdom and Empire, for they were convoked at the command of kings and emperors, and the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Church never had any patriarchal or <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> see whose <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was qualified to convoke or preside over the entire national episcopate. Besides the term "national" was not very widespread in ancient times, it being the custom to speak rather of "universal" or "plenary" councils as in Africa or <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, but this word was not used as synonymous with ecumenical. It meant plenary for all the provinces of Roman Africa or for the whole <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> Kingdom, in the same sense that the plenary Councils of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> were meetings of the episcopate of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.

<p>This being understood, the canonical prescriptions regarding national councils are the same, proportionately speaking, as for general and provincial councils. To be legitimate their convocation must proceed from the authority having competent <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the national church, either partiarch or <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> (provided that these titles be not merely honorary). In default of this authority the convocation should proceed from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, as was done for the recent national councils enumerated below. It was because the convocation was not competent that the "national council" of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> of 1811 was not legitimate. To this convocation corresponds on the part of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to appear in person at the assembly unless they have a legitimate reason. But representation of a numerous episcopate will suffice, as was the case in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, according to canon ix of the Plenary Council of <a href="../cathen/10304b.htm">Milevis</a> in 402. The presidency rightfully belongs to the delegates of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, if there are any; if not, to the partiarch or <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, or to the oldest <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, as was the custom in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdoms. A national council freely discusses the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or mixed matters which have been the cause of the meeting; the decisions adopted become a law for the entire nation, but like those of provincial councils, and with much more reason, they must first be submitted to the approval of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>No historical or canonical interest of any importance determines which of the ancient councils held at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, and Constantinople may be classed as national councils. Obviously, the presence and authority of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of the various churches rendered this sort of meeting very easy. On several occasions the Patriarchs of Constantinople convoked the whole episcopate of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>. But these councils have left no very distinct traces in the Greek canonical collections, whereas those of the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> Church of the Persian Empire consist chiefly of canons of the national councils held from 410 to 775 (cf. "Synodicon Orientale", ed. Chabot, 1903). In the West also there was an important series of national councils, the most noteworthy being the assemblies of the episcopate of <a href="../cathen/01191a.htm">Christian Africa</a> under the presidency of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, especially the twenty-one plenary council held during the episcopate of Aurelius (393-427), which form almost the entire canonical collection of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. In like manner the Spanish canonical collection is chiefly composed of the canons of the seventeen national councils which the episcopate of the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> Kingdom held, nearly always at Toledo, from 589 to 694. But while the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">African councils</a> consisted wholly of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the kings and nobles of the kingdom assisted at those of Toledo, without, however, otherwise interfering in matters properly religious. The same was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> national councils, where the episcopal assemblies were, as it were, duplicated by an assembly of nobles; occasionally, as at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in 813, there was a third group, composed of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The list opens with three national councils which assembled the episcopate of the three kingdoms into which Gaul was divided at the beginning of the fifth century: <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Agde</a> (506) for <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> Kingdom; Orl&eacute;ans (511), for the Kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>; Epaone (517), for that of the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>. Most of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> councils held under the Merovingians and Carlovingians assembled the episcopate of one, sometimes of several kingdoms. The king often assisted thereat and the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> decisions bearing on discipline were the subject of royal ordinances or capitulars. These double assemblies of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <em>comites</em> (counts) were the usual method in the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdoms, and <a href="../cathen/14697c.htm">Thomassin</a> rightly regards them as the historical origin of parliaments. The acts of these meetings have not been gathered into a uniform complete canonical collection.

<p>In recent centuries <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> national councils have been resumed in the East and the West at the instance of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and under the presidency of their <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>. Without going into details, the most noteworthy of these were: the provincial or national councils of Mount Lebanon, for the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, in 1736, confirmed by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>; those of 1803 and 1871 for the Albanians; those of Zamosk 1720 and 1891 for the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>; that of 1841 for the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a>; that of Sciarfa in the Lebanon (1888) for the Syrians; that of Cairo in 1898 for the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a>; that of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1911 for the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>; in America the three plenary Councils of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> (1852, 1866, 1884), and the plenary rather than national council of Latin America in 1899.
