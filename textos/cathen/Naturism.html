<h1>Naturism</h1>  

<p>Naturism is the term proposed by R&eacute;ville to designate the worship of nature. It differs from <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">Naturalism</a>, which is not a religion, but a system of <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheistic</a> philosophy, and from natural religion, which sets forth those <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man attainable by the native power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and forming the prolegomena to Revelation, e.g., the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, the spiritual and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> nature of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the moral order. As a theory of religion Naturism exhibits three phases: I. Ethnographic Naturism. II. Philosophic Naturism. III. Science-Naturism.
<h2 id="section1">Ethnographic naturism</h2>

<p>According to R&eacute;ville, Naturism is the primitive form of religion, the basis and source of all existing forms. This is the thesis of comparative mythology, which is said to reveal a primitive nature worship. Its foundation is a twofold assumption: <ul><li>(1) the philosophic assumption of evolution, which maintains that man is a development by slow and successive stages from the animal; hence the corollary advanced by Spencer and Thorn as as the first principle in the evolutionary history of religion, viz., that primitive man was a creature of emotion, not of intelligence which is the product of more advanced culture; <li>(2) the ethnographic assumption that primitive man existed in the savage state, a condition and mode of life akin to that prevailing among the non-civilized races of today, e.g., Tylor, Lubbock, Tiele, R&eacute;ville, and Spencer.</ul>

<p>The core and essence of nature-worship is that nature is animated throughout. In the conception of animated nature, R&eacute;ville is in touch with de Brosses and Comte, who claim that <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a> is the primitive religion and by <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a> understand the primitive tendency to conceive external objects as animated by a life analogous to that of man. He differs from Tylor, who specifies the cause of the animation, e.g., spirits or <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and from Comte in holding that the primitive animation in its initial Stage is not <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a>, but becomes so when in process of development the spirit or <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is distinguished from the object. Thus with R&eacute;ville, the <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">Animism</a> of Tylor and Spencer is the intermediate link between Naturism and <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a>. Tylor, however, considers nature-worship as the connecting bond between <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a> and <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">Polytheism</a>, yet admits that the stages of this process defy any more accurate definition. Giddings follows Tylor in holding that religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are of two groups: <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">animistic</a> interpretation of the finite, and <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">animistic</a> interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> ("Induct. Sociol", New York, 1901). In like manner Blackmar teaches that nature-worship was nothing more than spirit-worship localized in the various objects of nature (Elem. of <a href="../cathen/14115a.htm">Sociology</a>, New York, 1905). On the other hand Guyan calls Naturism, Physiolatry, of which zoolatry, i.e., worship of animals, is a department (The Non-Religion of the Future, New York, 1907). Hadden holds that primitive folk do not draw a sharp distinction between things animate and inanimate (The Study of Man, New York, 1898). Jastrow says that the savage and primitive man does not differentiate between such an object of nature as the sun and its personification as a being possessing life in some form, and teaches that it is an axiom of primitive man's <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> to ascribe life to all things (The Study of Religion, London, 1902). Schrader says the common basis of the ancient Indo-European religion was a worship of nature, and appeals to linguistics which shows that the ancient Aryans designated objects perceived as doing something, e.g., the rain rains, the fire burns ("Prehistoric Antiquities of the Aryan Peoples", tr. by Jevons, London, 1890). Hence the discovery of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or spirit as distinct from the object is the origin of <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">Animism</a>. This theory is sometimes called personification of natural forces, but only in the sense that nature is conceived as living, as vital with creative and preservative powers. Personification, in the strict sense of investing material things with the attributes of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is far above the power of early man and appears only in later forms of developed <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. Hence, according to R&eacute;ville, there is first the naive cult of natural objects as possessing life and in some way supposed to influence man; this is followed by <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">Animism</a> and <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a>; and finally a third stage known as the natural mythologies founded on the dramatization of nature, e.g., the historic <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheisms</a> of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, of the Teutonic, Greek, Latin, and <a href="../cathen/15318a.htm">Vedic</a> races.

<p>Primitive man faces the world about him in childlike wonder. The succession of the seasons, of night and day, of storm and cloud, the growth of living things, exhibit nature in constant and varied changes. He views natural phenomena as the effects of causes beyond his comprehension and control. Conscious of his own agency, though unable yet to distinguish <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the parts of the body, he attributes agency like his own to the objects which surround him. Awe and delight possess him. Having no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> at all of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, writes Keary, he makes the things themselves gods by worshipping them ("Early Relig. Develop." in Nineteenth Cent., Aug., 1878). Hence Brinton writes that nature is known to man only as a force which manifests itself in change (The Religious Sentiment, New York, 1876). Ratzel explains this craving for <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> in an <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">animistic</a> sense as tending to vivify all the higher phenomena of nature by attributing to them a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and applies the word <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">Polytheism</a> to all <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of the lower grades ("Hist. of Mankind", tr. Butler, London, 1896). With Crawley the phenomena of change exhibits a vital principle analogous to man's own and this principle of life vaguely conceived by primitive man but strongly felt is the origin of religion; in a later stage of development Vitalism passes into <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">Animism</a> (The Tree of Life, London, 1905). Shaw says the difference between Naturism and Spiritism is largely a difference of emphasis, because neither can be excluded from the interpretation of a primitive which as yet has made no sharp separation between subject and object. Hence the worshipper of nature seems to ally himself with external objects which, as he surveys them anthropopatically, serve as a support and mirror of his own fleeting fancies. These natural objects are further conceived by primitive man as either friendly or inimical to him. In the particular view of <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a> the physical and psychical further appears. Thus Shaw in the primitive Naturism resulting from the contact of man with the phenomena of the external world, attempts to reconcile the <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> theories of fear as set forth by Hume, Clodd, Tiele, Deinker, and of desire either natural with Brinton or morbid by Feuerbach.



<p>Pfleidner holds that nature is animated throughout, that this view was just as natural for the childlike fancy of the primitive man as it is still today for children and poets. According to him this animation of nature is not to be explained by saying that the primitive man only compared natural phenomena with living beings or even that he thought of them as a domicile or operation of spirits of human origin. Such a view would suppose a definite distinguishing of the sense element and of the supersensible element; but this distinction only appeared later, whereas, for the original mythological notion, the sense element and the subject that was active in it was still conceived as one. He says the real sources of religion are external nature and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man; for the prehistoric <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in spirits, out of which developed the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, cannot yet be properly called religion; it only contained the germs of religion. Tylor teaches animation of nature, but, as with him the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or spirit animates material objects, nature-worship is ranged under the concept of <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a>. De la Saussaye objects to this view on the ground that nature-worship bears the strongest impress of originality, and therefore is not a phase of <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a>, which is not original. Darwin seems to combine the ascription of life to natural objects, dreams, and fears (Descent of Man, I, p. 65). Thomas says that, while theoretically separable, magic religion, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in ghosts and in nature-worship practically run into one another and become inseparably mingled; therefore it is idle to attempt to establish a priority in favour of any one of them (Social Origins, Chicago, 1909).

<p>De la Saussaye confesses that it is equally difficult to determine the limits of nature-worship in the opposite direction. The classification of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> shows how wide an area it covers. Thus Tiele divides the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of the world into nature-religions and <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, and holds that the latter developed from the former. Caird keeps the same division, but uses the terms "objective" and "subjective", and says they unite in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Jastrow objects to the classification of Tiele, that the higher nature-religions contain <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> elements. <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a> holds the primitive religion was an immediate nature-religion, which betrays its features in various primitive peoples and in a more advanced form in Chinese, Pali, and Sanscrit cults. The transition from the lowest stage to the next higher, according to him, is effected by means of the Persian <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a>, the Ph&oelig;nician religion of pain, and the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> religion of mystery. De la Grassi&egrave;re (Des <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> compar&eacute;es, Paris, 1899) says Naturism is at the origin of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>. He distinguishes a lesser Naturism and a greater Naturism. The lesser Naturism passes into <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">Animism</a>, which in turn develops into <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a>, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">Idolatry</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01558c.htm">Anthropomorphism</a>. With its earlier forms the object is adored in its concrete reality; at a later period, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or spirit is separated from the object and becomes the real object of worship. Lesser Naturism embraces the primitive gods, e.g., those which personify the woods, mountains, and rivers. It has many forms, e.g., worship of animals as in Greek and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> mythology, worship of trees, e.g., laurels of Apollo, myrtle of Venus, worship of groves as with Druids, worship of stones, water, springs, lakes, mountains, the elements. Hence it embraces the mythologic naiads, fauns, dryads, fairies, and sirens.

<p>Greater Naturism refers to vast gatherings of objects and especially heavenly bodies, e.g., sun, moon, stars. This he says is the basis of the <a href="../cathen/15318a.htm">Vedic</a> religion, e.g., Varuna, i.e., <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> at night, Mitri, i.e., <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> at day, Indra, i.e., rain, Agni, i.e., fire, and survives in Sab&aelig;ism. This Naturism is at the origin of Greek and Latin mythology, e.g., Zeus, i.e., the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, Aurora, i.e., the dawn, Apollo, i.e., light, Heph&aelig;stos, i.e., fire, and the worship of mother earth. Tiele holds that the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of the Redskins and <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> are just as much nature <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> as the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15318a.htm">Vedic</a>, and Greek, though he admits a great difference exists between the former and the latter. Von Hartmann designates the lowest stage of religion as "naturalistic henotheism". Jastrow holds that man's consciousness of his own weakness in the contemplation of the overwhelming strength of nature furnishes the motive for seeking support from certain powers of nature and to accomplish this he must make them favourably disposed to him. He says this theory can be variously put, hence can furnish a starting point for pessimistic views, e.g., Von Hartmann, and of optimistic views of man's position in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and it appeals to minds in sympathy with religion as to those, e.g., Feuerbach, who regard religion as an illusion.

<p>Thus Naturism teaches that man originally was destitute of religion, and that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> awe in face of natural forces was the cause of his earliest <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But this theory cannot be accepted. <ul><li>(1) Its basis, viz., that man has evolved from an animal state, is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. "We know now", writes Max M&uuml;ller "that savage and primitive are very far indeed from meaning the same thing" (Anthrop. Relig., 150). Talcott Williams shows the necessity of revising and limiting the confidence with which the modern savage has been used to explain a nobler past (Smithsonian Report of 1896). M&uuml;ller and <a href="../cathen/08703a.htm">Kuhn</a> refute Mannhardt and Meyer* by showing that popular <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> of modern folk-lore are fragments of a higher mythology. <li>(2) It does not explain how man gained the predicate <em>God</em>, which is the real problem of religion. Jastrow says mere personification of nature lacks a certain spiritual element which appears to be essential to the rise of a genuine religious feeling in man. Hence, he adds, M&uuml;ller postulated "the perception of the Infinite" (Hibbert Lectures, 1878), and Tiele appeals to "man's original unconscious innate sense of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinity</a>" (Elem. of the Scien. of Rel., II, 233). Thus Fairbairn says, "the constitutive element is what mind brings to nature, not what nature brings to mind" (Studies in the Philos. of History and Religion, New York, 1876). <li>(3) The theory is defective, for it does not explain all the facts of early religious consciousness. If nature were the only source of religion, man would express his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in terms drawn from nature alone. Now the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of language shows that primitive man expresses his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>:

<ul><li>(a) In terms drawn from physical nature, e.g., Dyans Pitar of the Indo-Europeans; Zeus pater of the Greeks; Jupiter of the Latins; Tieu, i.e., <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, of the Chinese; the Persian D&aelig;va; the Celtic Dia from the Sanscrit root Div., i.e., to shine. <li>(b) By moral and metaphysical concepts: thus, e.g., Jahweh, i.e., the one who is; <a href="../cathen/01233a.htm">Ahura</a>, i.e., the living one; El, i.e., the powerful shown in <a href="../cathen/05393a.htm">Elohim</a>, <a href="../cathen/01316a.htm">Allah</a>, <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>; Shaddai, i.e., the mighty; Bel, i.e., the lord; Molech, i.e., king; <a href="../cathen/01146a.htm">Adonai</a>, i.e., lord. Such concepts are found with barbarous peoples, e.g., Unkululu of the Zulus, i.e., father; Papang of the Australian, i.e., father; the Mongolian Teng-ri and Hunnish Tang-li, i.e., lord of the sky. Furthermore the earliest Indo-European conception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is Dyaus Pitar, i.e., the heaven-father.</ul>

<p>Hence the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of paternity is characteristic of their primitive consciousness. Such a concept is too sublime and elevated to be explained on the principles of Naturism; which is utterly unable to account for the second class of terms. <li>(4) The main support for the theory of Naturism is the <a href="../cathen/15318a.htm">Vedic</a> religion. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that traces of nature-religion are found in the Vedas. But to say that the <a href="../cathen/15318a.htm">Vedic</a> gods are nothing more than nature personified or that nature-worship is the primitive type of Indian religion is to betray the superficial observer. The moral and spiritual conceptions are older than the physical <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. That the ancient Aryans viewed nature as active is not ground to hold that for this reason they worshipped nature. We express ourselves after this fashion in ordinary conversation. The great <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shown by the Vedas is the fact of degeneracy.</ul>
<h2 id="section2">Philosophic naturism</h2>

<p>This phase is based on the philosophic unity of animated nature. The ancient <a href="../cathen/04405c.htm">cosmogonies</a> represent the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to attain a unity amid the multiplicity of external things. In the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> conception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the world is set forth a Naturism which satisfies the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> craving for unity and gives scope to the exercise of the religious emotions. Hence it was that these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> could look with indulgent tolerance upon the religious practices of the common people. The basic principle with both was the same; e.g., the worship of animated nature. To the cultured Roman this principle was conceived as a philosophic unity; to the ordinary mind it was viewed in manifold forms and activities which were the source and explanation of their countless nature-deities. <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> in its various forms exhibits the same thought. This is especially <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of modern <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheistic</a> theories. The substance of <a href="../cathen/14217a.htm">Spinoza</a>, the synthesis of Fichte, the identity of Schelling, the absolute <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a> is at basis the same conception. Its religious significance is twofold: <ul><li>(a) the more spiritual and metaphysical form appears in Neo-Hegelianism which teaches the unity of human and Divine consciousness. This reflects the nature-philosophy of <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a> which exhibits the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, i.e., <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in its finitude. <li>(b) The idealistic Naturism is shown in the writings of the Romantic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, e.g., Goethe, Shelley, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and attains its full expression in Transcendentalism.</ul>

<p>To Emerson as to Goethe, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the world. Emerson seems to consider religion as the delight which springs from a harmony of man and nature. Emerson taught that the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is composed of nature and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and by nature means all the <em>not me</em>, i.e., physical nature; art, other man, and his own body. Hence in germ the worship of humanity is contained in Emerson's teaching, just as it is latent in Neo-Hegelianism, and appears in the <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegelian</a> evolution of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, i.e., the <a href="../cathen/01060c.htm">Absolute</a> or <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when viewed from its human side, i.e., as a human process.
<h2 id="section3">Science-naturism</h2>

<p>This is the religion of the science-philosophy and appears under two forms: <ul><li>(a) The religion of humanity was first presented in systematic form by Comte, and contains the principles of the humanitarian theories so prevalent a generation ago. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not exist or at least cannot be known, therefore <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> calls forth the sole and supreme expression of our veneration and service. <li>(b) Cosmic religion, a title invented by Fiske, and designated the homage of reason to forces of nature or the awe of phenomena which suggest mysterious and destructive power.</ul>

<p>Spencer speaks of the emotion resulting from the contemplation of the unknowable into which as into a mystery all cosmical questions resolve. Fiske develops this thought and makes the essence of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> emotion very largely consist in the sense of mystery. To Fiske the unknowable manifests itself in a world of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and is yet conceived to be in itself something beyond these manifestations. Hence worship is ever the dark side of the shield of which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the bright side. Thus Matthew Arnold's definition of religion as morality touched by emotion becomes with Tyndall poetry and emotion in face of matter <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> with mind. Cosmism, according to Fiske, is, however, more than a mere sentiment. He says the fundamental principle of religion is obedience to the entire requirements of nature. This is righteousness, just as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a wilful violation of nature's <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Science-Naturism finds its most complete delineation in Seeley's "Natural Religion". He uses the term "Natural Religion" in contrast with the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. In rejecting supernaturalism and submitting to <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> is presented a <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> to which, he says, all men do actually agree, viz., nature in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a mere synonym for nature. Hence there is no power beyond or superior to nature nor anything like a cause of nature. Whether we say <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or prefer to say nature, the important thing is that our minds are filled with the sense of a power, to all appearance <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> and eternal, a power to which our own being is inseparably connected, in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of whose ways alone is safety and well-being, in the contemplation of which we find a <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>. Religion begins with nature-worship which in its essence is admiration of natural objects and forces. But natural mythology has given place to <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, which sees mechanism where will, purpose, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> had been suspected before and drops the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to take up instead the less awful name of Nature. Nature is a name comprehending all the uniform <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> as known in our experience. It is the residuum that is left after the elimination of everything <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, and comprehends man with all his thoughts and aspirations not less than the forms of the material world.

<p>Here, according to Seeley, we have the kernel of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and the purified worship of natural forms, i.e., the higher <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>. He holds that this is not <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, for not the individual forms of nature are the objects of worship, but nature considered as a unity. Art and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> as well as morality, form the substance of religion, hence culture is the essence of religion and its fruit is the higher life. Thus religion, in his view in the individual is identified with culture, in its public aspect is identified with civilization. For Seeley the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the atmosphere of thought, feeling, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that surrounds the State; it is in fact its civilization made more or less tangible and visible. His universal Church is universal civilization. And as culture is a threefold devotion to beauty, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, so the term civilization expresses the same threefold religion, shown on a larger scale in the characters, institutions, and customs of nations. (Cf. <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">ANIMISM</a>; <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">DEITY</a>; <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">FETISHISM</a>; <a href="../cathen/14789a.htm">TOTEMISM</a>; <a href="../cathen/15017a.htm">TRANSCENDENTALISM</a>.)
