<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Nazareth</h1>  

<p>The town of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> where the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> dwelt when the <a href="../cathen/06330a.htm">Archangel</a> announced to her the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> of the Word, and where Christ lived until the age of thirty years, unknown, and obedient to Mary and Joseph. In the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, the name occurs in a great orthographical variety, such as <em>Nazaret</em>, <em>Nazareth</em>, <em>Nazara</em>, <em>Nazarat</em>, and the like. In the time of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Onomasticon), its name was Nazara (in modern Arabic, <em>en Nasirah</em>), which therefore, seems to be the correct name; in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> we find its derivatives written <em>Nazarenos</em>, or <em>Nazoraios</em>, but never <em>Nazaretaios</em>. The etymology of Nazara is <em>neser</em>, which means "a shoot". The <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> renders this word by <em>flos</em>, "flower", in the Prophecy of Isaias (<a href="../bible/isa011.htm#vrs1">11:1</a>), which is applied to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Epist., xlvi, "Ad Marcellam") gives the same interpretation to the name of the town.

<p>Nazareth is situated in the most southerly hills of the Lebanon range, just before it drops abruptly down to the plain of Esdraelon. The town lies in a hollow plateau about 1200 feet above the level of the Mediterranean, between hills which rise to an altitude of 1610 feet. The ancient Nazareth occupied the triangular hillock that extends from the mountain on the north, having its point turned to the south. Its northwestern boundary is marked by numerous Jewish <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> which have been discovered on the slope of Jebel es Likh. The southeastern limit is the small valley that descends from the beautiful spring called St. Mary's Well, which was, no doubt, the chief attraction for the first settlers. In the last fifty years the population has increased rapidly, and amounts at the present day to more than 7000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. The modern houses, white and clean, run up all along the hillsides, especially on the north. Spread out in the shape of an amphitheatre, set in a green framework of vegetation, Nazareth offers to the eye a very attractive picture.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>The town is not mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, nor even in the works of <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>. Yet, it was not such an insignificant hamlet as is generally believed. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, first, that it possessed a <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>. Neubaurer (La g&eacute;ographie du Talmud, p. 190) quotes, moreover, an elegy on the destruction of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, taken from ancient Midrashim now lost, and according to this document, Nazareth was a home for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who went by turns to Jerusalem, for service in the Temple. Up to the time of Constantine, it remained exclusively a Jewish town. St. Epiphaenius (Adv. Haereses, I, ii, haer., 19) relates that in 339 Joseph, Count of <a href="../cathen/14716a.htm">Tiberias</a>, told him that, by a special order of the emperor, "he built churches to Christ in the towns of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, in which there were none, for the reason that neither Greeks, <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were allowed to settle there, viz., at <a href="../cathen/14716a.htm">Tiberias</a>, at <a href="../cathen/04798b.htm">Diocaesarea</a>, or Sepphoris, at Nazareth, and at Capharnaum". <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">St. Paula</a> and St. Sylvia of Aquitaine visited the shrines of Nazareth towards the end of the fourth century, as well as Theodosius about 530; but their short accounts contain no description of its monuments. The Pilgrim of <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> saw there about 570, besides "the dwelling of Mary converted into a basilica", the "ancient <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>". A little treatise of the same century, entitled "Liber nominum locorum ex Actis", speaks of the church of the Annunciation and of another erected on the site of the house "where our Lord was brought up". In 670 <a href="../cathen/01699b.htm">Arculf</a> gave <a href="../cathen/01135c.htm">Adamnan</a> an interesting description of the basilica of the Annunciation and of the church of the "Nutrition of Jesus".

<p>The toleration which the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> showed towards the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, after conquering the country in 637, did not last long. Willibald, who visited Nazareth about 725, found only the basilica of the Annunciation, "which the Christians", he says "often redeemed from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, when they threatened to destroy it". However, in 808 the author of the "Commemoratorium de easis Dei" found twelve <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at the basilica, and eight at the Precipice, "a mile away from the town". The Greek emperor, John Zimisces, reconquered <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> from the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> in 920, but, five years afterwards, he was poisoned by his eunuchs, and his soldiers abandoned the country. The basilica, finally ruined under the reign of the Calif Hakem (1010), was rebuilt by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> in 1101, as well as the church of the Nutrition, or St. Joseph's House. At the same time the Greeks erected the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Gabriel near the Virgin's Well. The <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">archiepiscopal See of Scythopolis</a> was also transferred to Nazareth. After the disastrous battle of Hattin (1187), the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, were compelled to leave the town. On 25 March, 1254, St. Louis and Queen Marguerite celebrated the <a href="../cathen/01542a.htm">feast of the Annunciation</a> at Nazareth; but nine years later, the Sultan Bibars completely destroyed all the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> buildings, and Nazareth soon dwindled down to a poor village. In the fourteenth century, a few <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Friars established themselves there, among the ruins of the basilica. They had much to suffer during their stay, and many of them were even <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, especially in 1385, in 1448, and in 1548, when all the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> were driven out of the country. In 1620 Fakher ed D&icirc;n, Emir of the Druses, allowed them to build a church over the Grotto of the Annunciation; but it was ruined some years later by the Bedouins. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> nevertheless remained near the sanctuary, and in 1730 the powerful Sheikh Dhaher el Amer authorized them to erect the church which is still to be seen.
<h2>Sites</h2>

<p>In the fourth century, local tradition indicated the house of the Virgin at the top of the southern point of the hill, which rises some 30 feet over the plain. The dwelling consisted of a little building with a grotto in the rear. Even now, other dwellings like this are to be found in Nazareth. Explorations made in 1909, beneath and around the present church, brought to light the whole plan of the ancient basilica of Constantine. It was built from west to east, divided into three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> by two rows of syenite columns, and the grotto was in the north <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> followed the same plan, and even kept the two rows of columns; they only added new pillars and gave to the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>, as well as to the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>, the appearance and solidity of a fortress. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> erected their church across the ancient building, so as to bring the grotto beneath the choir at the end of the central <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> was always three or four feet below the pavement of the church. Since 1730 there have been fifteen steps leading down to the Chapel of the Angel, and two more to the Grotto itself. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> is the traditional site of the house, properly so-called, of the Virgin; at the north end of it, the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> pavement is well preserved, and is adorned with an inscription in Greek letters which undoubtedly dates from the sixth century. A beautiful altar dedicated to the mystery of the Annunciation occupies the Grotto. On the left are two columns of porphyry, certainly placed there in the fourth century.

<p>About 300 paces northeast of the basilica of the Annunciation, "the church of the Nutrition" marked the traditional site of St. Joseph's dwelling, where, after the warning of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angel</a> (<a href="../bible/mat001.htm#vrs20">Matthew 1:20</a>), he received Mary his spouse with the ceremonial prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> for matrimony. After his return from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Joseph came back to Nazareth and, with the Virgin and the Divine Child, again occupied his own house. There <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was brought up and dwelt till he left the town at the beginning of His public life. Two documents of the fourth century allude to this place, and two others of the sixth and seventh mention the church of the Nutrition, built over it. Excavations made in 1909 brought to light the lower layers of a fine church of the twelfth century, from which a staircase hewn in the rock descends to an irregular grotto excavated beneath the sanctuary. Several interesting details answer to the description given by <a href="../cathen/01699b.htm">Arculf</a> in 670. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> are about to rebuild this sanctuary.

<p>The mountain "whereon the city is built" ends in a row of hills that overlook the town. On the south, one mile and a half away, the chain of hills terminates abruptly in two precipitous peaks separated by a deep, wild gorge. The western peak is called Jebel el Qafsah, "Mount of the Leap", or "of the Precipice". A <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> building on this mountain, where the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> would have cast Christ down headlong, was still occupied by eight <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at the beginning of the ninth century. The ruins now to be seen there belong to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the time of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>.
