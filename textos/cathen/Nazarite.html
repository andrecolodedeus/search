<h1>Nazarite</h1>  

<p>(Hebrew, "consecrated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>").

<p>The name given by the Hebrews to a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> set apart and especially <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the Lord. Although Nazarites are not unknown to early Hebrew history, the only specific reference to them in the Law is in Num. (vi, 1-21), a legal section of late origin, and embodying doubtless a codification of a long-standing usage. The regulations here laid down refer only to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> consecrating themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for a specified time in virtue of a temporary <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, but there were also Nazarites for life, and there are even indications pointing to the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of children to that state by their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>.

<p>According to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in Num. (vi, 1-21) Nazarites might be of either sex. They were bound to abstain during the period of their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> from wine and all intoxicating drink, and even from all products of the vineyard in any form. During the same period the hair must be allowed to grow as a mark of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. The Nazarite was forbidden to approach any corpse, even that of his nearest relatives, under pain of defilement and consequent forfeiture of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. If through accident he finds himself defiled by the presence of a corpse, he must shave "the head of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>" and repeat the operation on the seventh day. On the eighth day he must present himself at the sanctuary with two turtle doves or young pigeons, one of which was offered as a <a href="../cathen/07396b.htm">holocaust</a> and the other for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and furthermore, in order to renew the lost <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to present a yearling lamb for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> offering. At the expiration of the period determined by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> the Nazarite brought to the sanctuary various offerings, and with symbolical ceremonies including the shaving of the head and the burning of the hair with the fire of the peace offering, he was restored by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to his former liberty (<a href="../bible/num006.htm#vrs13">Numbers 6:13-21</a>). The meaning symbolized by these different rites and regulations was in part negative, separation from things worldly, and partly positive, viz. a greater fulness of life and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> indicated by the growth of the hair and the importance attached to ceremonial defilement.

<p>The existence of a class of perpetual Nazarites is known to us through occasional mention of them in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> writings, but these references are so few and vague that it is impossible to determine the origin of the institution or its specific regulations, which in some respects at least must have differed from those specified in Num. (vi, 1-21). Thus of Samson who is called a "Nazarite of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from his mother's womb" (<a href="../bible/jdg013.htm#vrs5">Judges 13:5</a>), it is merely said that "no razor shall touch his head". No mention is made of abstention from wine etc., though it has been plausibly assumed by many commentators, since that restriction is enjoined upon the mother during the time of her pregnancy. That his quality of Nazarite was considered to be independent of defilement through contact with the dead is plain from the account of his subsequent career and the famous exploits attributed to him. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Samuel is generally reckoned among the Nazarites for life, but nothing is known of him in that connection beyond what is inferred from the promise of his mother: "I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life, and no razor shall come upon his head" (<a href="../bible/1sa001.htm#vrs11">1 Samuel 1:11</a>). It has likewise been inferred from Jer. (35; cf. <a href="../bible/2ki010.htm#vrs15">2 Kings 10:15 sqq.</a>) that the Rechabites were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the Lord by the Nazarite <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, but in view of the context, the protest against drinking wine which forms the basis of the assumption is probably but a manifestation on the part of the clan of their general preference for the simplicity of the nomadic as opposed to the settled life. In a passage of Amos (ii, 11, 12) the Nazarites are expressly mentioned together with the Prophets, as young men raised up by the Lord, and the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> are reproached for giving them wine to drink in violation of their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. The latest <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> reference is in I Mach. (iii, 49, 50), where mention is made of a number of "Nazarites that had fulfilled their days." In the prophecy of Jacob (<a href="../bible/gen049.htm#vrs26">Genesis 49:26</a>), according to the <a href="../cathen/05140a.htm">Douay Version</a>, Joseph is called a "Nazarite among his brethren", but here the original word <em>nazir</em> should be translated "chief" or "leader" &#151; Nazarite being the equivalent of the defective rendering <em>nazaroeus</em> in the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>. The same remark applies to the parallel passage in Deuteronomy (xxxiii, 16), and also to Lam. (iv, 7), where "Nazarites" (<a href="../cathen/07176a.htm">Hebrew</a> <em>nezerim</em>) stands for "princes" or "nobles".

<p>Nazarites appear in <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> times, and reference is made to them for that period not only in the Gospel and Acts, but also in the works of <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (cf. "Ant. Jud.", XX, vi, 1, and "Bell. Jud.", II, . xv, 1) and in the Talmud (cf. "Mishna", Nazir, iii, 6). Foremost among them is generally reckoned <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a>, of whom the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> announced that he should "drink no wine nor strong drink". He is not explicitly called a Nazarite, nor is there any mention of the unshaven hair, but the severe austerity of his life agrees with the supposed asceticism of the Nazarites. From Acts (xxi, 23 sqq.) we learn that the early Jewish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> occasionally took the temporary Nazarite <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, and it is probable that the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> mentioned in <a href="../bible/act018.htm#vrs18">Acts 18:18</a>, was of a similar nature, although the shaving of his head in Cenchr&aelig;, outside of Palestine, was not in conformity with the rules laid down in the sixth chapter of Numbers, nor with the interpretation of them by the Rabbinical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of that period. (See Eaton in Hastings, Dict. of the Bible, s.v. Nazarites.) If we are to believe the legend of Hegesippus quoted by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250102.htm"><em>Church History</em> II.23</a>), St. James the Less, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, was a Nazarite, and performed with rigorous exactness all the ascetic practices enjoined by that rule of life.
