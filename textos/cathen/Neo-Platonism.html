<h1>Neo-Platonism</h1>  

<h2>General survey</h2>

<p>A system of idealistic, spiritualistic philosophy, tending towards <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, which flourished in the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> world of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> during the first centuries of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era. It is of interest and importance, not merely because it is the last attempt of Greek thought to rehabilitate itself and restore its exhausted vitality by recourse to Oriental religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, but also because it definitely entered the service of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a> and was used as a weapon against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. It derives its name from the fact that its first representatives drew their inspiration from <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> doctrines, although it is well known that many of the treatises on which they relied are not genuine works of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. It originated in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, a circumstance which would, of itself, indicate that while the system was a characteristic product of the Hellenistic spirit, it was largely influenced by the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> ideals and mystic tendencies of Oriental thought.

<p>To understand the neo-Platonic system in itself, as well as to appreciate the attitude of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> towards it, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to explain the two-fold purpose which actuated its founders. On the one hand, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> thought in the Hellenic world had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> itself inadequate to the task of moral and religious regeneration. <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoicism</a>, <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureanism</a>, Eclecticism and even Scepticism had each been set the task of "making men happy", and each had in turn failed. Then came the thought that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">idealism</a> and the religious forces of the Orient might well be united in one <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> movement which would give definiteness, homogeneity, and unity of purpose to all the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> world to rescue itself from impending ruin. On the other hand, the strength and, from the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> point of view, the aggressiveness of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> began to be realized. It became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> world, to impose on the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by showing that <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Paganism</a> was not entirely bankrupt, and, in the political world, to rehabilitate the official <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a> of the State by furnishing an interpretation of it, that should be acceptable in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Speculative <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoicism</a> had reduced the gods to personifications of natural forces; <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> had definitely denied their existence; <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> had sneered at them. It was time, therefore, that the growing prestige of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> should be offset by a philosophy which, claiming the authority of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> revered, should not only retain the gods but make them an essential part of a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> system. Such was the origin of Neoplatonism. It should, however, be added that, while the philosophy that sprang from these sources was <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a>, it did not disdain to appropriate to itself elements of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristoteleanism</a> and even <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureanism</a>, which it articulated into a <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">Syncretic</a> system.
<h2>Forerunners of Neoplatonism</h2>

<p>Among the more or less eclectic <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> who are regarded as forerunners of the Neoplatonic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, the most important are Plutarch, Maximus, Apuleius, Aenesidemus, Numenius. The last-mentioned, who flourished towards the end of the second century of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era, had a direct and immediate influence on Plotinus, the first systematic neo-Platonist. He taught that there are three gods, the Father, the Maker (Demiurgos), and the World. <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo the Jew</a> (see PHILO JUDAEUS), who flourished in the middle of the first century, was also a forerunner of Neoplatonism, although it is difficult to say whether his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the mediation of the Logos had a direct influence on Plotinus.
<h2>Ammonius Saccas</h2>

<p>Ammonius Saccas, a porter on the docks of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, is regarded as the founder of the Neoplatonic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Since he left no writings, it is impossible to say what his doctrines were. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, however, that he had an extraordinary influence over men like Plotinus and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, who willingly abandoned the professional teachers of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> to listen to his discourses on wisdom. According to <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, he was born of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, but reverted to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>. The date of his birth is given as 242.
<h2>Plotinus</h2>

<p>Plotinus, a native of <a href="../cathen/09468a.htm">Lycopolis</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, who lived from 205 to 270 was the first systematic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. When he was twenty-eight years old he was taken by a friend to hear Ammonius, and thenceforth for eleven years he continued to profit by the lectures of the porter. At the end of the first discourse which he heard, he exclaimed: "This man is the man of whom I was in search." In 242 he accompanied the <a href="../cathen/06648b.htm">Emperor Gordian</a> to Mesopotamia, intending to go to <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. In 244 he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where, for ten years, he taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, counting among his hearers and admirers the <a href="../cathen/06366a.htm">Emporer Gallienus</a> and his wife Solonia. In 263 he retired to Campania with some of his disciples, including Porphyry, and there he died in 270. His works, consisting of fifty-four treatises, were edited by Porphyry in six groups of nine. Hence they are known as the "Enneads".The "Enneads" were first published in a Latin translation by Marsilius Ficinus (Florence, 1492); of recent editions the best are Breuzer and Moser's (Oxford, 1855), and Kirchoff's (Leipzig, 1856). Parts of the "Enneads" are translated into English by Taylor (London, 1787-1817).

<p>Plotinus' starting-point is that of the idealist. He meets what he considers the paradox of materialism, the assertion, namely, that matter alone exists, by an emphatic assertion of the existence of spirit. If the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is spirit, it follows that it cannot have originated from the body or an aggregation of bodies. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> source of reality is above us, not beneath us. It is the One, the <a href="../cathen/01060c.htm">Absolute</a>, the Infinite. It is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> exceeds all the categories of finite thought. It is not correct to say that He is a Being, or a Mind. He is over-Being, over-Mind. The only attributes which may be appropriately applied to Him are Good and One. If <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> were only One, He should remain forever in His undifferentiated unity, and there should be nothing but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He is, however, good; and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, like light, tends to diffuse itself. Thus from the One, there emanates in the first place Intellect (<em>Nous</em>), which is the image of the One, and at the same time a partially differentiated derivative, because it is the world of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, in which are the multiple archetypes of things. From the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> emanates an image in which there is a tendency to dynamic differentiation, namely the World-soul, which is the abode of forces, as the Intellect is the abode of Ideas. From the World-Soul emanates the Forces (one of which is the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>), which, by a series of successive degradations towards nothing become finally Matter, the non-existent, the antithesis of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. All this process is called an emanation, or flowing. It is described in figurative language, and thus its precise <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> value is not determined. Similarly the One, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is described as light, and Matter is said to be darkness. Matter, is, in fact, for Plotinus, essentially the opposite of the Good; it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and the source of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. It is unreality and wherever it is present, there is not only a lack of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> but also a lack of reality. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is free from Matter; He alone is Light; He alone is fully real. Everywhere there is partial differentiation, partial darkness, partial unreality; in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, in the World-Soul, in Souls, in the material <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the reality, the spiritual, is, therefore, contrasted with the world, the unreal, the material. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is noumenon, everything else is appearance, or phenomenon.



<p>Man, being composed of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is partly, like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, spiritual, and partly like matter, the opposite of spiritual. It is his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to aim at returning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by eliminating from his being, his thoughts, and his actions, everything that is material and, therefore, tends to separate him from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> came from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It existed before its union with the body; its survival after death is, therefore, hardly in need of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. It will return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by way of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, because that which separates it from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is matter and material conditions, which are only illusions or deceptive appearances. The first step, therefore in the return of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the act by which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, withdrawing from the world of sense by a process of purification (<em>katharsis</em>), frees itself from the trammels of matter. Next, having retired within itself, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> contemplates within itself the indwelling <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. From the contemplation of the Intellect within, it rises to a contemplation of the Intellect above, and from that to the contemplation of the One. It cannot, however, reach this final stage except by revelation, that is, by the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who, shedding around Him the light of His own greatness, sends into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and saint a special light which enables it to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself. This <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> of the one so fills the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that it excludes all consciousness and feeling, reduces the mind to a state of utter passivity, and renders possible the union of man with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> (<em>ekstasis</em>) by which this union is attained is man's supreme <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, the goal of all his endeavor, the fulfillment of his destiny. It is a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> which receives no increase by continuance of time. Once the philosopher-saint has attained it, he becomes confirmed, so to speak, in grace. Henceforth forever, he is a spiritual being, a man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and a wonder-worker. He commands all the powers of nature, and even bends to his will the demons themselves. He sees into the future, and in a sense shares the vision, as he shares the life, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.
<h2>Porphyry</h2>

<p>Porphyry, who in beauty and lucidity of style excels all the other followers of Plotinus, and who is distinguished also by the bitterness of his opposition to Christiani, was born A.D. 233, probably at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>. After having studied at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, he visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and there became a devoted disciple of Plotinus, whom he accompanied to Campania in 263. He died about the year 303. Of his work "Against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>" only a few fragments, preserved in the works of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Apologists, have come down to us. From these it appears that he directed his attack along the lines of what we should now call historical criticism of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and the comparative study of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>. His work "De Antro Nympharum" is an elaborate allegorical interpretation and defence of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> mythology. His <em>Aphormai</em> (Sentences) is an exposition of Plotinus's philosophy. His biographical writings included "Lives" of Pythagoras and Plotinus in which he strove to show that these "god-sent" men were not only models of philosophic <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> but also <em>thaumatourgoi</em>, or "wonder-workers", endowed with theurgic powers. The best known of all his works is a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> treatise entitled <em>eosagoge</em>, or "Introduction to the Categories of Aristotle". In a Latin translation made by <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a>, this work was very widely used in the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and exerted considerable influence on the growth of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>. It is, as is well known, a passage in this "Isagogue" that is said to have given occasion to the celebrated controversy concerning <a href="../cathen/15182a.htm">universals</a> in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. In his expository works on the philosophy of Plotinus, Porphyry lays great stress on the importance of theurgic practices. He holds, of course, that the practices of asceticism are the starting-point on the road to perfection. One must begin the process of perfection by "thinning out the veil of matter" (the body), which stands between the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and spiritual things. Then, as a means of further advancement, one must cultivate self-contemplation. Once the stage of self-contemplation is attained, further progress towards perfection is dependent on the consultation of oracles, divination, bloodless <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to the superior gods and bloody <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to demons, or inferior powers.
<h2>Iamblichus</h2>

<p>Iamblichus, a native of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, who was a pupil of Porphyry in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and died about the year 330, while inferior to his teacher in power of exposition, seemed to have a firmer grasp of the speculative principles of Neoplatonism and modified more profoundly the metaphysical doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. His works bear the comprehensive title "Summary of Pythagorean Doctrines". Whether he or a disciple of his is the author of the treatise "De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum" (first published by Gale, Oxford, 1678, and afterwards by Parthey, Berlin, 1857), the book is a product of his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and proves that he, like Porphyry, emphasized the magic, or theurgic, factor in the Neoplatonic scheme of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. As regards the speculative side of Plotinus's system, he devoted attention to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of emanation, which he modified in the direction of completeness and greater consistency. The precise nature of the modification is not clear. It is safe, however, to say that, in a general way, he forestalled the effort of Proclus to distinguish three subordinate "moments", or stages, in the process of emanation.

<p>While these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> defenders of neo-Platonism were directing their attacks against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, representatives of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in the more practical walks of life, and even in high places of authority, carried on a more effective <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Hierocles, proconsul of Bithynia during the reign of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> (284-305), not only <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of his province, but wrote a work, now lost, entitled "The discourse of a Lover of Truth, against the Christians", setting up the rival claims of neo-Platonic philosophy. He, like <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a>, Celsus, and others, was roused to activity chiefly by the claim which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> made to be, not a national religion like <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, but a world-wide, or universal, religion. <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a> sums up the case of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> thus: "Divine government is not through a special <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> (such as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>) teaching an authoritative <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, but through the order of the visible <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> and all the variety of civic and national institutions. The underlying harmony of these is to be sought out by free examination, which is philosophy." (Whittaker, "Neo-Platonists", p. 155). It is in the light of this principle of public policy that we must view the attempt of Iamblichus to furnish a systematic defence of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">Polytheism</a>. Above the One, he says, is the Absolutely First. From the One, which is thus itself a derivative, comes <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, which, as the Intellectual and the Intelligible, is essentially dual. Both the Intellectual and the Intelligible are divided into triads, which are the superterrestrial gods. Beneath these and subordinate to them, are the terrestrial gods whom he subdivides into three hundred and sixty celestial beings, seventy-two orders of sub-celestial gods, and forty-two orders of natural gods. Next to these are the semi-divine heroes of mythology and the philosopher-saints such as Pythagoras and Plotinus. From this it is evident that neo-Platonism had by this time ceased to be a purely academic question. It had entered very vigorously into the contest waged against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. At the same time, it had not ceased to be the one force which could claim to unify the surviving remnants of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> culture. As such, it appealed to the woman-philosopher Hypatia, whose fate at the hands of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mob at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, in the year 422, was cast up as a reproach to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (see <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">CYRIL OF ALEXANDRIA</a>). Among the contemporaries of Hypatia at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> was another Hierocles, author of a commentary on the Pythagorean "Golden Verses".
<h2>Proclus</h2>

<p>Proclus, the most systematic of all the Neoplatonists, and for that reason known as "the scholastic of neo-Platonism", is the principal representative of a phase of philosophic thought which developed at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> during the fifth century, and lasted down to the year 529, when, by an edict of Justinian, the philosophic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> were closed. The founder of the Athenian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was Plutarch, surnamed the Great (not Plutarch of Chaeronea, author of the "Lives of Illustrious Men"), who died in 431. his most distinguished scholar was Proclus, who was born at Constantinople in 410, studied <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, and about the year 430 became a pupil of Plutarch at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>. He died at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> in 485. He is the author of several Commentaries on <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, of a collection of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> to the gods, of many works on mathematics, and of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> treatises, the most important of which are: "Theological Elements", <em>stoicheiosis theologike</em>, (printed in the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> ed. of Plotinus's Works); "Platonic Theology" (printed, 1618, in a Latin translation by Aemilius Portus); shorter treatises on Fate, on Evil, on Providence, etc. which exist only in a Latin translation made by William of Moerbeka in the thirteenth century. These are collected in Cousin's edition, "Procli Opera", Paris, 1820-1825. Proclus attempted to systematize and synthesize the various elements of neo-Platonism by means of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>. The cardinal principle upon which his attempt rests is the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, already foreshadowed by Iamblichus and others, that in the process of emanation there are always three subordinate stages, or moments, namely the original (<em>mone</em>), emergence from the original (<em>proodos</em>), and return to the original (<em>epistrophe</em>). The reason of this principle is enunciated as follows: the derived is at once unlike the original and like it; its unlikeness is the cause of its derivation, and its likeness is the cause, or reason, of the tendency to return. All emanation is, therefore, serial. It constitutes a "chain" from the One down to the antithesis of the One, which is matter. By the first emanation from the One come to "henades", the supreme gods who exercise providence over worldly affairs; from the henades comes the "triad", intelligible, intelligible-intellectual, and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, corresponding to being, life, and thought; each of these is, in turn, the origin of a "hebdomad", a series corresponding to the chief divinities of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> pantheon: from these are derived "forces", or "souls", which alone are operative in nature, although, since they are the lowest derivatives, their efficacy is least. Matter, the antithesis of the One, is inert, dead, and can be the cause of nothing except imperfection, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and moral <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The birth of a human being is the descent of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into matter. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, however, may ascend, and redescend in another birth. The ascension of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is brought about by asceticism, contemplation, and the invocation of the superior powers by magic, divination, oracles, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, etc.
<h2>The last Neoplatonists</h2>

<p>Proclus was the last great representative of neo-Platonism. His disciple, Marinus, was the teacher of Damascius, who represented the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at the time of its suppression by Justinian in 529. Damascius was accompanied in his exile to <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> by Simplicius, celebrated as a neo-Platonic commentator. About the middle of the sixth century John Philoponus and Olympiadorus flourished at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> as exponents of Neoplatonism. They were, like Simplicius, commentators. When they became <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, the career of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> came to an end. The name of Olympiadorus is the last in the long line of scholarchs which began with Speusippus, the disciple and nephew of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>.
<h2>Influence of Neoplatonism</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> thinkers, almost from the beginning of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> speculation, found in the spiritualism of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> a powerful aid in defending and maintaining a conception of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> materialism rejected, but to which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> was irrevocably committed. All the early refutations of <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> materialism are <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a>. So, too, when the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of Plotinus began to prevail, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers took advantage of the support thus lent to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that there is a spiritual world more real than the world of matter. Later, there were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, like Nemesius (flourished c. 450), who took over the entire system of neo-Platonism so far as it was considered consonant with <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">Christian dogma</a>. The same may be said of Synesius (<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ptolemais, c. 41), except that he, having been a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, did not, even after his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>, give up the notion that Neoplatonism had value as a force which unified the various factors in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> culture. At the same time there were elements in Neoplatonism which appealed very strongly to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, especially to the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, and these elements were more and more strongly accentuated in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> systems: so that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the writings of Plotinus in a Latin translation, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to exclude from his interpretation of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a> many of the tenets which characterized the neo-Platonic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. In this way, he came to profess a <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonism</a> which in many respects is nearer to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> "Dialogues" than is the philosophy of Plotinus and Proclus. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writer whose neo-Platonism had the widest influence in later times, and who also reproduced most faithfully the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, is the <a href="../cathen/05013a.htm">Pseudo-Dionysius</a>. The works "De Divinis Nominibus", "De hierarchia coelesti", etc., are now admitted to have been written at the end of the fifth, or during the first decades of the sixth, century. They are from the pen of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a>, a disciple of Proclus, probably an immediate pupil of that teacher, as is clear from the fact that they embody, not only Proclus's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, but even lengthy passages from his writings. The author, whether intentionally on his part, or by some mistake on the part of his readers, came to be identified with Dionysius who is mentioned in the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a> as a convert of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. Later, especially in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he was further identified with Dionysius the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Thus it came about that the works of the Pseudo-Areopagite, after having been used in the East, first by the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> and later by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, became known in the West and exerted a widespread influence all through the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. They were translated into Latin by John Scotus Eriugena about the middle of the ninth century, and in this form were studied and commented on, not only by mystic writers, such as the Victorines, but also by the typical representatives of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>, such as <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>. None of the later scholastics, however, went the full length of adopting the <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> of the Pseudo-Areopagite in its essential principles, as did John Scotus Eriugena in his "De divisione naturae".

<p>After the suppression of the Athenian <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> by Justinian in 529, the representatives of neo-Platonism went, as we have seen, to <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. They did not remain long in that country. Another exodus, however, had more permanent consequences. A number of Greek neo-Platonists who settled in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> carried with them the works of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, which, having been translated into Syriac, were afterwards translated into Arabic, Hebrew, and Latin, and thus, towards the middle of the twelfth century, began to re-enter <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> through <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. These translations were accompanied by commentaries which continued the neo-Platonic tradition commenced by Simplicius. At the same time a number of anonymous <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> works, written for the most part under the influence of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Proclus, some of which were ascribed to <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, began to be known in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and were not without influence on <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>. Again, works like the "Fons vitae" of <a href="../cathen/02156a.htm">Avicebrol</a>, which were known to be of Jewish or Arabian origin, were neo-Platonic, and helped to determine the doctrines of the scholastics. For example, <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of materia primo-prima is acknowledged by <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a> himself to be derived from <a href="../cathen/02156a.htm">Avicebrol</a>. Notwithstanding all these facts, <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a> was in spirit and in method <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a>; it explicitly rejected many of the neo-Platonic interpretations, such as the unity of the Active Intellect. For this reason all unprejudiced critics agree that it is an exaggeration to describe the whole <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> movement as merely an episode in the history of neo-Platonism. In recent times this exaggerated view has been defended by M. Picavet in his "Esquisse d'une histoire compar&eacute;e des philosophies m&eacute;di&eacute;vales" (Paris, 1907).

<p>The neo-Platonic elements in <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante's</a> "Paradiso" have their origin in his interpretation of the scholastics. It was not until the rise of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> in the fifteenth century that the works of Plotinus and Proclus were translated and studied with that <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> which characterized the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. It was then, too, that the theurgic, or magic, elements in Neo-Platonism were made popular. The same tendency is found in Bruno's "Eroici Furori", interpreting Plotinus in the direction of materialistic <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheism</a>. The active rejection of <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialism</a> by the Cambridge <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonists</a> in the seventeenth century carried with it a revival of interest in the neo-Platonists. An echo of this appears in Berkeley's "Siris", the last phase of his opposition to materialism. Whatever neo-Platonic elements are recognizable in the transcendentalists, such as Schelling and <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a>, can hardly be cited as survivals of philosophic principles. They are rather inspirational influences, such as we find in <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonizing</a> poets like Spenser and Shelley.
