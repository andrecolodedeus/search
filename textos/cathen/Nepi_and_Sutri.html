<h1>Nepi and Sutri</h1>  

<p>Nepi and Sutri (Nepsin et Sutrin), united <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of the province of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, in the Ciminian region.

<p>Nepi is situated on a hill of tufa, and is surrounded by great walls; its <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which occupies the site of an ancient temple of Jupiter, contains <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a>, <a href="../cathen/11737b.htm">Perugino</a>, and Zuccari; the communal palace was begun by <a href="../cathen/15428a.htm">Vignola</a>, and the fort was built by Peter Louis Farnese. There still exist at Nepi the ruins of an amphitheatre and of ancient baths, from which several <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> in the Vatican museum were taken, among these the one in basalt of King Nectanabis I, with an <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> inscription. Nepete and Sutrium, as these cities were called, belonged to the Faliscans, who called the Romans to their assistance when the Etruscans invaded them; the invaders (389, 311, 310), after twice defeating the Romans, went. beyond the Ciminian forest to attack the Etruscans in Etruscan territory; wherefore, Livy calls these towns "claustra Etruri&aelig;"; in 382, they became Latin colonies. In the Gothic War Nepi was one of the last strongholds of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>. The town was sacked by the Lombards in 569, and then fell into decadence. In the eighth century, however, it became the seat of Tuto, a Lombard <em>dux</em>, known for his interference in the papal election of 768. In the struggle between the emperors and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, Nepi was imperialist during the reigns of <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a>, <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a>, <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>; on the other hand, in 1160, it fought against the commune of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in 1244, was besieged by <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>. A <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> possession, first of the prefects of Vico, and then of the Orsinis, of the Colonnas, and of C&aelig;sar Borgia, from 1537 to 1545, it was erected into a duchy in favour of Peter Louis Farnese; and when the latter was transferred to <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, Nepi returned to immediate dependence on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In 1798 the French set fire to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and to the episcopal palace, in which last edifice valuable archives were lost. The existence of an <a href="../cathen/03510a.htm">early Christian cemetery</a> witnesses the great antiquity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Nepi, which venerates, as its evangelizer, St. Ptolem&aelig;us, who, it is claimed, was a disciple of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. In 419, Eulalius, competitor of <a href="../cathen/02658a.htm">Pope St. Boniface I</a>, was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nepi; Bishop Paulus was sent as visitor to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>; Bishop Stephanus, in 868, was one of the presidents and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> of the Council of Constantinople against Photius. The sees of Nepi and Sutri were united in 1435. Sutri is placed, like a hanging garden, upon a steep hill on the Cassian Way; the ancient town occupied two hills connected by a bridge, and its walls, built of great tufa rocks, are yet to be seen. In the neighbourhood, there are many Etruscan <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>; the ancient anphitheatre, hewn out of the solid rock, is a remarkable work. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is of the thirteenth century, modernized by frequent alterations. Santa Maria della Grotta is an interesting church. The history of Sutri in antiquity resembles that of Nepi, for Sutri also was taken by the Lombards in 569, but was retaken by the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> Romanus; Luitprand likewise took the town in 726, but in the following year restored it to "St. Peter". As the city is on the Cassian Way not far from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, it was, as a rule, the last halting-place of the German emperors on their way to the city, and sometimes they received there the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>. Two famous <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were held at Sutri, one in 1046, at which Sylvester III was deposed, and resigned the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a>; the other in 1059, was held against <a href="../cathen/02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a>. Here also the agreement of 1111 between Paschal II and the emperor Henry V was concluded. In 1120, the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/06795b.htm">Gregory VIII</a> withdrew to Sutri, and was besieged there by <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Calixtus II</a>; he was finally delivered up to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by the Sutrians (1121). After this, the possession of the city was frequently contested by the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> counts of Anguillara and the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> prefects of Vico, especially in 1264. Sutri was contained in the Duchy of Nepi. This town also has an <a href="../cathen/03510a.htm">ancient Christian cemetery</a> where the body of <a href="../cathen/13163a.htm">St.Romanus</a> was found, who is the patron of the city; the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> possesses a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of him by <a href="../cathen/02510b.htm">Bernini</a>. Among the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of Sutri is St. Felix (about 275). The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of known date was Eusebius (465); other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Martinus, or Marinus, who was sent as ambassador to Otho I in 963; Benedictus, who, in 975, became <a href="../cathen/02428d.htm">Pope Benedict VII</a>; the famous <a href="../cathen/02673a.htm">Bishop Bonitho (Bonizo)</a>, historian of the Gregorian epoch, who was driven from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by the anti-papal faction and later was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was united to Nepi under Bishop Luke de Tartarts (1345); under Pomponius Cesi (1519), who became a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, the cemetery of St. Savinilla was discovered; Michael Ghislieri (1556) became <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pope St. Pius V</a>; Joseph Chianti (1701) founded the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; Camillus Simeoni (1782) was exiled by the French and became a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. In the territory of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is the city of Braciano on the lake of the same name (<em>lacus Sabazius</em>); it is believed by some to be the ancient <em>Forum Claudii</em>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of which was at the council of <a href="../cathen/10318a.htm">Pope Melchiades</a> in 303; others identify the <em>Forum Claudii</em> with Oriolo, which is in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>. The united <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of Nepi and Sutri are immediately dependent upon <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; they have 31 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>: with 42,000 inhabitants, 13 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men, and 13 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 10 of which maintain <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.
