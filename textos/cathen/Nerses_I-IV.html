<h1>Nerses I-IV</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>.
<h2>Nerses I</h2>

<p>Surnamed "the Great". Died 373. Born of the royal stock, he spent his youth in Caesarea where he married Sanducht, a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Mamikonian princess. After the death of his wife, he was appointed chamberlain to King Arshak of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. A few years later, having entered the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>, he was elected <a href="../cathen/03454a.htm">catholicos</a>, or patriarch, in 353. His <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> marks a new era in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> history. Till then the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had been more or less identified with the royal family and the nobles; Nerses brought it into closer connection with the people. At the Council of Ashtishat he <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> numerous <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> on marriage, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fast</a> days, and Divine worship. He built <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and sent <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> throughout the land to preach the Gospel. Some of these reforms drew upon him the king's displeasure, and he was exiled, probably to <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>. Upon the <a href="../cathen/01095a.htm">accession</a> of King Bab (369) he returned to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Bab <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a dissolute and unworthy ruler and Nerses forbade him entrance to the church. Under the pretence of seeking a reconciliation, Bab having invited Nerses to his table poisoned him.
<h2>Nerses II</h2>

<p>Said to have been born at Aschdarag in Bagrevand, was patriarch from 548 to 557. He was a Jacobite <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> (cf. Ter-Minassiantz, 163-64). Under him was held the Second Council of Tvin or Dovin (554).
<h2>Nerses III</h2>

<p>Of Ischkan; surnamed Schinogh, "the church builder". Erected patriarch in 641; died 661. He lived in days of political turmoil. The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> had to choose between the Greeks and the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, and their new conquerors, the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>. Nerses remained friendly to the Greeks, whilst the military chiefs sided with the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>. Constans II (642-48) hastened into <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> to punish the rebels and subject them to the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>. Nerses and a number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> went forth to meet him and declared they accepted the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>. Disagreement with the satrap Tehodorus compelled Nerses to withdraw from the administration of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> from 652 to 658.
<h2>Nerses IV</h2>

<p>Surnamed Klaientsi from the place of his birth, and Schnorkhali, "the Gracious", from the elegance of his writings, b. at Hromela, Cilicia; d. 1173. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by his grand uncle, Patriarch Gregory Vkaiaser and afterwards by the <em>vartabed</em>, or doctor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, Stephen Manuk. Having been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by his brother, Patriarch Gregory III, he was sent to preach throughout <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. He was present at the latin Council of Antioch in 1141 and was elected patriarch in 1166. Nerses, together with Emperor Manuel Comnenus, laboured hard to unite the Greek and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Churches. The union, however, was never consummated, the majority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> remaining obstinate. Nerses is regarded as one of the greatest <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> writers. His prose works include: "Prayers for every hour of the day" (Venice, 1822); his "Synodal letter" and five "letters" to Manuel Comnenus (tr. Latin by Cappelletti, Venice, 1833). He wrote in verse: "Iesu Orti", a Bible history; an "elegy" on the capture of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>; a "History of Armenia"; two "Homilies", and many <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>. In the "Iesu Orti", the elegy on <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, and the first letter to Manuel Comnenus, we find testimonies to the <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">primacy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>.
