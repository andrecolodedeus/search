<h1>Nerses of Lambron</h1>  

<p>Born 1153 at Lambron, Cilicia; died 1198; son of Oschin II, prince of Lambron and nephew of the patriarch, <a href="../cathen/10754a.htm">Nerses IV</a>. Nerses was well versed in sacred and profane <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and had an excellent <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Greek, Latin, Syriac, and probably Coptic. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> in 1169, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> in 1176 and became a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> advocate of the union of the Greek and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Churches. In 1179 he attended the Council of Hromcla, in which the terms of the union were discussed; his address at this council is considered a masterpiece of eloquence and style. The union was decided upon but never consummated owing to the death of Emperor Manuel Comnenus in 1180. Manuel's successors abandoned the negotiations and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, who dissatisfied with the Greeks now turned to the Latins. Leo II, Prince of Cilicia, desirous to secure for himself the title of King of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, sought the support of <a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Celestine III</a> and of Emperor Henry VI. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> received his request favourably, but made the granting of it dependent upon the union of Cilicia to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He sent Conrad, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Mayence, to <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, and the terms of union having been signed by Leo and twelve of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, among whom was Nerses, Leo was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> King of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, 6 January, 1198. Nerses died six months afterwards, 17 July. Nerses is justly regarded as one of the greatest writers in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> literature. He deserves fame as poet, prose writer, and translator. He wrote an elegy on the death of his uncle, <a href="../cathen/10754a.htm">Nerses IV</a>, and many <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>. His prose works include his oration at the Council of Hromcla (tr. Italian by Aucher, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1812; tr. German by Neumann, Leipzig, 1834); Commentaries on the Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Wisdom, and the Minor <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a>; an explanation of the liturgy; a letter to Leo II and another to Uskan, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Antioch; and two <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>. He translated into <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>; the "Dialogues" of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a>; a life of this saint; and the letters of Lucius III and <a href="../cathen/04018a.htm">Clement III</a> to the patriarch, Gregory. From the Syriac he translated the "Homilies" of Jacob of Serugh and, probably from the Coptic, the "Life of the Fathers of the Desert". Some writers ascribe to him an <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> version of a commentary of <a href="../cathen/01473a.htm">Andreas of C&aelig;sarea</a> on the Apocalypse. Nerses in his original writings frequently refers to the primacy and <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.
