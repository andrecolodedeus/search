<h1>Neusohl</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of Neusohl (Hung. Beszterczeb&acirc;nya; Lat. Neosoliensis), founded in 1776 by <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>. Cardinal Peter Pazm&aacute;ny had already contemplated founding four new sees in order to relieve the <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Archdiocese of Gran</a>; one of these was Neusohl, but this project was dropped in 1636. Instead of four sees, four <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> were established in Kassa, Neusohl, Kossy, and Safron, After the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuit Order</a> the project of the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was again taken up. On 7 December, 1775, <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a> informed the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a> that it had been decided to establish a new see, and asked the chapter to state what revenues would be assigned to it. On 11 January, 1776, the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was founded by royal decision, and on 13 March, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was made public. Baron Franz Berchtold was named the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1776-93), and in 1778-85 held the first canonical Visitation. His efforts to benefit the diocese materially were unsuccessful, and the great fire of 1782, which destroyed the episcopal residence, had such a bad effect upon the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> contemplated giving it up, and planned the transfer of Berchtold to the See of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> opposed the plan, as well as that of the union of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> with that of Sz&eacute;kes or Roszsny&oacute;. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, lyceum and the four archdeaneries were founded in the time of Bishop Anton Mackay (1818-23). A <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> was held at Neusohl 21 November, 1821, where the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> constitution was drawn up, which is valid to this day. Bishop Joseph Rudnyciuszky (184-50) was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> Government on account of his political views, and on 20 August, 1846, was arrested and sentenced to six years' <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, and deprived of his episcopal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honours</a>. He retracted in 1850, whereupon he was released from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. Among the more recent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Arnold Tpolzi was distinguished. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Wolfang Radnoi. Since 1835 the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter possesses its own insignia, and is composed of six members; there are also six titular canons. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> has a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, 112 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, and 371 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; there are 168 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 49 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and 2 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunneries</a>. In 1902 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population numbered in all 223,779 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.
