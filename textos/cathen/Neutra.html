<h1>Neutra</h1>  

<p>(Nitria; Nyitha) &#151; Diocese of Neutra (Nitriensis).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in Western <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>. The exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of its foundation is unknown. Some attribute the foundation to Fridigit, wife of Rosemund, the Marconian chief, in the middle of the fourth century, but without any more evidence than the alleged foundation by Archbishop Wolf of Lorch. Nor is the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> a direct continuation of one which existed in Svatopluk's time and was suffragan of Prag-Potesover; neither is it probable that the saintly King Stephen founded it. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was probably founded in the time of King Coloman about 1105-07, although <a href="../cathen/08737a.htm">St. Ladislaus</a> had it in contemplation, for a royal document still exists, in which he endows the church at Neutra with much <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The church, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a>, was there in the lifetime of St. Stephen, and is supposed to have been endowed by Queen Gisela. Gervasius was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1105-14), and was followed by Nicholas (1133). The successors of <a href="../cathen/08737a.htm">St. Ladislaus</a> increased the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to which the city of Neutra belonged from the middle of the thirteenth century. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter was in all probability established at the same time as the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>; but until the seventeenth century very little is known about it. There were only nine canons in the seventeenth century, but the number was increased to ten in 1780. The see shared the fate of the country, the invasion of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a>, internal quarrels, all of which wrought much mischief, especially the disastrous battle of Mohacs (1526). The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was in time deprived of its revenues which fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. Valentine Toorch first had possession of them, and then later Alexius Thurd&oacute;, after which the latter's brother, Bishop Franz Thurd&oacute; acquired them, but later on became a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> found a foothold in Neutra, owing to the sympathy of certain noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. Bishop Paul Bornemissos tried to restore the financial condition of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, but unsuccessfully; during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> the chapter was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee and only returned to Neutra in 1607. Bishop Franz Forzach was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to oppose the spread of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> (1590-1607); his work was carried on by his successors, especially by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who since 1640 worked <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> for the re-establishment of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders settled in the diocese. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> as it stands today was erected by Ladislaus Erdodyl (1796-31). Among the more famous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was <a href="../cathen/13194a.htm">August Roskov&aacute;ny</a> (1859-92), famed as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> and canonist. Bishop Emmerich Bende has been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> since 1893; his coadjutor with right of succession is Count William Batthyany. The see includes a part of the counties of Neutra and Trenescen, and is divided into 4 archdeaneries. There are 148 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 237 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 194 of whom are <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; also 15 <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, numbering 145 members, of both sexes. In 1907 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population numbered 350,398. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter is composed of ten canons, and there are six titular canons, also 3 titular <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>.
