<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Nevada</h1>  

<p>A Western state of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, bounded on the North by <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> and <a href="../cathen/07627a.htm">Idaho</a>, on the East by <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a> and Arizona and on the South and West by <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>. It lies between the latitudes of 35&#176; (in its extreme southern point) and 42&#176; north, and between the meridians of 114&#176; and 120&#176; longitude. The extreme length of the state from north to south is 483 miles, while its extreme breadth from east to west is 320 miles. The total area of the state of Nevada is 110,590 square miles.
<h2>Climate</h2>

<p>The climate of Nevada is dry, pleasant, and healthful. Summers are as a rule, very warm, except in the high mountainous districts, while the winters are generally long and sometimes severe. In late spring and early autumn there prevails a warm westerly wind which has often disastrous effects, as it is generally accompanied by sand storm. The mean temperature in January is 28&#176;, while that of summer is 71&#176;. The average rainfall throughout the year is ten inches, and the greater part of this precipitation comes between the months from December to May.
<h2>Population</h2>

<p>The history of the population of Nevada since 1850 presents some of the most interesting figures in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Census records. From the time of the early settlements in 1850-60 to the years of the great mining developments in 1860-1880, the population rapidly increased from a few hundred pioneers to 60,000 people, while after 1885 (demonetization of silver) it declined until the end of the century, and from that time began to increase very rapidly. The figures showing the population of the state since 1860, according to U. S. Census Reports, are significant of these fluctuations: 1860, 6,857; 1870, 42,491; 1880, 62,226; 1890, 45,761; 1900, 42,335; 1910, 81,875.
<h2>Mineral production</h2>

<p>The mineral production of Nevada consists chiefly of gold and silver. For the year 1908 the entire mineral production, consisting chiefly of gold, silver, and a little lead, was valued at $19,043,820, while in 1909 the gold production alone was valued at; $15,908,400 and that of silver at $4,657,000, or a total production of $20,565,400 in gold and silver alone.
<h2>Agriculture and stock raising</h2>

<p>The agricultural products of Nevada for 1909 were valued thus: wheat, $1,074,000; oats, $1,165,000; barley, $228,000; potatoes, $459,000; hay, $5,187,000. From these figures it can be seen that the production of hay is an important one, being greater in 1909 than the entire production of silver. In stock raising the most important industry is that, of sheep. In 1909 the entire number of sheep in the state was 1,585,000 and the wool clip amounted to 8,754,720 lbs. Cattle raising is also an important industry.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> to visit what is now the State of Nevada, was, in all probability, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Friar Francisco G&aacute;rces. Father G&aacute;rces started from <a href="../cathen/14145a.htm">Sonora</a>, in northern Mexico, with Colonel Anza for <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> in 1775. In this famous journey, G&aacute;rces stopped at the junction of the Gila and Colorado Rivers, in order to explore the surrounding country and establish a mission. No settlements were made or mission founded, but from the account of Father G&aacute;rces' journey as given by Father Pedro Font, who accompanied G&aacute;rces and wrote a fairly complete history of their travels, it seems practically certain that they visited Nevada, which was then, and in fact until 1850-60, a nameless <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. The next to visit Nevada were also <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missionaries. These were Fr. Atanasio Dominiquez and Fr. Silvestre Velez de Escalante, who on their journey to Monterey, <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, turned to the East, crossed the Colorado River at the 37&#176; parallel, crossed the extreme southern part of what is now Nevada, and proceeded to explore <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a>. These <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> also merely explored these regions and no settlements were made nor missions established. After these visits of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> it is very probable that the military expeditions from <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a> from time to time reached the Colorado River near Nevada, but we have no record of any expedition having actually crossed over into the territory in question. In 1825, however, Peter Skeen Ogden, an American trapper from the Columbia River in the North-West, accompanied by a few men, started to explore the country to the south-east and reached the river now known as the Humboldt River, in the present State of Nevada, which was in 1825 a nameless country, lying between <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> (which was then an indefinite stretch of country north of southern <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>) and <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>, which included in 1825, <a href="../cathen/01719a.htm">Arizona</a> and parts of <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a> and <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a>. All the above territories, with unsettled boundaries on the north and east, belonged to Mexico until the treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo in 1848, at the close of the Mexican War, when they were ceded to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Long before these events, however, <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a> and Nevada were settled by Americans and even provisional government established. After the explorations of Ogden and his companions, American adventurers, mostly trappers, went to <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a> and Nevada, among whom was Kit Carson (then living in Taos, <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>), who in company with many others visited the country in 1831, 1833, 1844, 1845. In 1843-44, Fremont with Carson and Godey, conducted various explorations, largely hunting expeditions, into Nevada, and in 1844-45, Elisha Stevens, with a small party, among whom were two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, passed through Nevada on his journey from the Missouri River country to <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>. This was the first caravan to traverse all this stretch of territory. After the Mexican cession of 1848 and the discovery of gold in <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, Nevada was frequently traversed by the gold seekers and other western pioneers on their way to <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>. Shortly after the signing of the treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, the <a href="../cathen/10570c.htm">Mormons</a> who had migrated westward and built the city of <a href="../cathen/13404c.htm">Salt Lake</a>, established the State of Deseret, a commonwealth which was to include what is now <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a>, Nevada, Arizona parts of <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a>, <a href="../cathen/15724b.htm">Wyoming</a>, <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>. These <a href="../cathen/10570c.htm">Mormons</a> found it profitable business to meet the travellers on their way to <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> and furnish them provisions. In these trading expeditions they advanced south and west from <a href="../cathen/13404c.htm">Salt Lake City</a>, and in 1849, they founded the first settlement in what is now Nevada, near the Carson River. In 1850, Congress organized the territories of <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a> (what is now <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a> and Nevada), <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a> (what is now <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a> and Arizona), and the <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">State of California</a>. The territory now comprised in the State of Nevada was organized as Carson County, <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a>, under the political control, therefore, of the <a href="../cathen/10570c.htm">Mormons</a>. Congress had fixed the western boundary of the Territory of <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a> as the Sierra Nevada. The fact that the Sierra Nevada was continually kept in mind as the barrier between <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a> and <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, may have given an occasion to call the adjacent territory east of <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, Nevada, though the name does not come into prominence until 1860. By 1856, the mines were being strongly developed and American immigration was rapidly settling Carson County. A political conflict between the <a href="../cathen/10570c.htm">Mormons</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> for the control of the governmental affairs of Carson County (which included practically all of what is now Nevada) lasted for several years. In 1865 the citizens of this county, mostly <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">gentiles</a>, petitioned the Government of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> to be annexed to <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> or be organized as a separate territory. The Government gave little heed to these demands, and for five years the political struggle raged fiercely between the two factions. Congress at last put an end to these troubles, and in 1861 Carson County, <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a>, was organized as the Territory of Nevada. James W. Nye was appointed as the first territorial governor. Three years later a constitutional convention was held, a State constitution adopted, and in 1864 Nevada was admitted as a State, and H. G. Blaisdel was elected the first governor. During the years 1865-85, the material developments in Nevada made rapid strides, though continually hampered by a heavy <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> contracted since the early days of territorial legislatures.


<h2>Government</h2>

<p>Nevada was a part of the Territory of <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a> from 1850 to 1861, a separate territory from 1861 to 1864, and organized as a State in 1864. The State constitution when first adopted granted numerous privileges to mining interests. While at first this seemed to be an incentive to the development of the rising mining industries, it soon proved to be unfair to the commonwealth at large. A long series of litigations, costly to both sides, ensued between the State and the mine owners, in view of the amendments to the constitution, which struck out all parts which gave special privileges to the mining industry. The State constitution after many amendments is now a safeguard to the State and to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of its citizens. At present, Nevada is represented in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Congress by two senators and one representative.
<h2>Education</h2>

<p>At the time of the admission of Nevada as a territory in 1861, there was no public-school system and there were no <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The population of the territory was about 7000-8000 people, but there were only four or five small private <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. An attempt was made to organize a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> system in 1861, but beyond the appointment of a superintendent of public instruction and the establishment of a few <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with little or no funds, practically nothing was done until 1864, when Nevada was organized as a State. The number of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> was then eighteen, and by 1865 there were thirty-seven, and the number of pupils was about 1000. At present, Nevada has a complete system of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, gradually developed, which begins with the primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and ends with the State University. The <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> affairs of the State are controlled and managed by a State Board of Education consisting of the State governor, the President of the University, and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. The State is divided into five <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> districts, each district being under the supervision and control of a deputy superintendent and there are no county superintendents. According to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the State all children between the ages of eight to fourteen years are compelled to attend <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has never been rigidly enforced. At present (1908), there are in Nevada 17,583 children under twenty-one years of age, of whom thirty-eight are <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> and fifty Mongolians. Of all these, 6,733 attend the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and 595 attend private and denominational <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The total number of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the State is 308 with 414 teachers. There are two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with about 200 pupils and an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> under the care of religious.

<p>The State University was opened in 1886. It is now located at Reno and has various departments of arts, literature, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. The teaching force consists of fifty-four professors, assistant professors, and instructors, and in 1909-10 the attendance was 220 students. The annual expenditures are at present about $200,000, some of this money being appropriated for building purposes. The State has also a mining <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, located at <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a> City, with about thirty students.
<h2>Religion</h2>

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church to be built in Nevada was the one erected by Father Gallagher, at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, in 1861. In 1862 the church was blown down and another built in its place. In 1864 Father Monteverde erected the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church at Austin, and in 1871 Father Merril built the first church at Reno. The efforts of these first <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were the beginning of the history of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in Nevada. Nevada has at present no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the State does not form a diocese. The eastern half of the State, east of the 117th meridian, including also Austin and the country bordering on the Reese River to the West of the same meridian, belong ecclesiastically to the <a href="../cathen/13404c.htm">Diocese of Salt Lake</a>, Province of <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, while the territory west of the 117th meridian, with the exception of Austin and the country bordering on the Reese River, belong to the Diocese of Sacramento, of the same province. According to the Bureau of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Census (Bulletin No. 103, Religious Bodies, 1906) the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of Nevada was then 9,970, or 66% of the entire religious population of the State. The following are the principal <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> of the State and the church members in each:

<ul> <li><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 9,970, or 66% of the total; <li>Episcopalians 1,210, or 8%; <li>Latter Day Saints 1,105, or 7%; <li>Methodists 618, or 4%; <li>Presbyterians 520, or 3% <li><a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a> 316, or 2%. </ul>
<h3>Catholic immigration</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have gone to Nevada at different times, along with the general influx of population into the Western States from the Middle States in 1845-75. Since the very beginning of the history of the State, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has been an important factor in the upbuilding of the commonwealth and the welfare and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the people. The difficulties encountered were not easy to overcome in the midst of an unsettled, careless, and often lawless community in the years 1850-70. After the establishments of the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches in the new country by Fathers Gallagher, Monteverde, and Merril, came the great benefactor Father Monogue, who in 1863 established the pioneer benevolent organization of Nevada or the <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> Benevolent Society. This was at a time when organizations of this kind were very much in need in the western countries, and the praiseworthy work of this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, the charities of which were extended to all, regardless of creed, cannot be too highly commended. Father Monogue also established in 1864, the Nevada <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, St. Mary's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls and St. Vincent's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys, and St. Mary's <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, all under the care of Sisters.
<h3>Religious polity</h3>

<p>The State constitution guarantees to all <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> absolute freedom of worship and toleration of religious sentiment. By statutory law, all amusements, business transactions, opening of saloons and gambling, are forbidden on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has never been rigidly enforced. There is no law demanding a compulsory administration of a fixed form of <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and a simple affirmation or negation suffices before the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. There are no statutory <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of any kind that forbid <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> or profanity. It is customary to open the Legislature, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> year at the State University and many of the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, but there are no <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> either for or against such practices. By statutory law, however, religious instruction of any kind is absolutely forbidden in the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> funds cannot be used for sectarian purposes. Sunday, New Year's Day, Washington's Birthday, (Admission Day), Thanksgiving, and <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> are designated by law as non-judicial days and are observed as legal holidays. There is no law recognizing religious holidays as such. No statutory law exists as regards the <a href="../cathen/13649b.htm">seal of confession</a>, but it is presumed that the same is inviolable. Churches may be incorporated. All <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> that is used only for church purposes is by law exempt from taxation, and malicious injury to churches or <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> is by law punishable by fine or even <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. The lawfully licensed <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of all <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> is exempt from jury and military service. Marriage is recognized by law as a civil contract. It may be performed by any licensed minister or a civil judge. With the consent of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> marriage may be contracted by a man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of the ages of eighteen and sixteen respectively, and without the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents'</a> consent only at the ages of twenty-one and eighteen or over respectively. The parties contracting marriage must not be nearer kin than second cousins, or cousins in the second blood. The <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the State are very liberal. By the State law, <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorces</a> may be granted for impotency, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, desertion, <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>, cruelty, drunkenness, or neglect to provide.
