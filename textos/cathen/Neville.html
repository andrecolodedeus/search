Sent to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> he was one of Oates's intended victims. James II appointed him royal <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>. He was instructor of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> tertians at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, 1693. He returned to Lancashire, where he died, 19 February, 1708-9. He wrote "Life of Lady Warner" (St. Omer, 1691); "Catholic Loyalty" (London, 1688); "Rules and Instructions for the Sodality of the Immaculate Conception", etc.

<p>(4) Edward Neville (Scarisbrick), born 1663; died 15 November, 1735. He became a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, 1682; served on the Derbyshire mission, 1701, and after 1728 at Bushey Hall, Watford, Herts.

<p>(5) Edward Neville (Scarisbrick), born 1698; died 7 July 1778. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, 7 September, 1728. Superior of the Derbyshire mission, 1764, he laboured also in Lancashire.

He married Eleanor, daughter of Lord, Windsor. Arrested 3 November, 1538, on the charge of conspiracy with the brother of <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a>, he was sent to the Tower, tried at <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, and beheaded for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, 8 December.
