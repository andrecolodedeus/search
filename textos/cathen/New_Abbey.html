<h1>New Abbey</h1>  

<p>The Abbey of Sweetheart, named New Abbey Pow, or New Abbey, in order to distinguish it, from Dundrennan in the same county, is situated near the River Pow, in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Loch Kenderloch, Kirkcudbrightshire, <a href="../cathen/06370a.htm">Diocese of Galloway</a>, about eight miles from the town of Dumfries, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. The title of Abbey of Sweetheart was given by the foundress of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, Lady Devorgilla, daughter of Alan, Lord of <a href="../cathen/06370a.htm">Galloway</a>, who erected the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in order to keep in it a casket of <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> and silver, in which was embalmed the heart of her husband, King John de Baliol. [<em>Editor's Note:</em> Other sources state that this King John Baliol was actually the fourth son of Lady Devorgilla by her husband, John (I) Baliol.] Sweetheart is the last in order of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. It was begun in 1275, being a daughter of Dundrennan, of the lineage of Clairvaux. Henry, the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, built a magnificent church in the early English style. It measured 203 feet; in length, with a central tower 92 feet high; it had a <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> with <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>, <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> with <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> on their eastern sides, and a choir without <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>. The monastic buildings were in proportion, and were surrounded with a massive granite enclosing wall, from eight to ten feet high, large portions of which still remain. Very little is known of the old history of Sweetheart, except that the Maxwells, lords of Kirkconnel, whose castle was near by, and who were descendants of the Maxwell kings, were great benefactors of the place. The most celebrated superior of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was Abbot Gilbert Broun, the last of the line. He continued to uphold the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> long after the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, and was a powerful opponent of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. He was denounced several times on the charge of enticing to "papistrie" from 1578 to 1605; he was seized by his enemies in 1605 in spite of the resistance of the whole countryside, taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, and conveyed to <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, whence he was banished, he then became <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the Scots College, Paris, where he died in 1612 at the age of eighty-four. The possessions of Sweetheart Abbey passed into the hands of Sir John Spottiswoode in 1624, and with them the title of Lord of New Abbey. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> soon became a mere quarry for those who wanted ready-cut material for building. The chapter, with the remains of the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> over it, and a part of the church, are all that remain today.
