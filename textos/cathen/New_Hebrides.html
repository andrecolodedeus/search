<h1>New Hebrides</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicariate Apostolic</a> in Oceania; comprises the New Hebrides, with Banks and Torres, islands situated between 13&#176; and 21&#176; S. lat. And between 166&#176; and 170&#176; E long. The total area is about 580 sq. miles. The indigenous population, which has decreased considerably, amounts to about 75,000; they are for the most part of an olive or brown complexion, varying in darkness. Their languages, which are very numerous, belong to the Malay stock and their religious worship has for its object the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead, but they also recognize a higher Being who is good. The white population is about 1000, nearly 650 of whom are French and Great Britain under what is known as the "Condominium of the New Hebrides". They were discovered in 1606 by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> under Quiros, and were named Tierra Austral del S. Espiritu. In 1768 the French navigator, Bougainville, in sailing round the globe, came upon the same group and named them the Grandes Cyclades. Six years later, Cook discovered the island and gave them their present name. According to the account of Quiros, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who acted as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> to his ships, celebrated <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> several times in a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> built on the shore, and even held a procession of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. Nevertheless, the islands had to wait long for the preaching of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missionaries. Not until January, 1887, did four Marist <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, sent by Mgr. Fraysse, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of New Caledonia, definitively establish here the first missions, and they did it amid great difficulties. The missions, however, developed rapidly and in 1900, at the petition of Mgr. Fraysse, the New Hebrides were separated from his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and made a <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefecture Apostolic</a>, under P&egrave;re Doucer&eacute;, of the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a>. In 1904 this mission became a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a>, and P&egrave;re Doucer&eacute;, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14515a.htm">Terenuthis</a>. His residence is at Port-Vila. The staff of the mission now comprises 26 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 3 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> of the Lyons <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Society of Mary</a>. Their labours are seconded by 16 religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of the regular <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of Mary, and a certain number of native catechists. There are 20 missionary residences, besides numerous annexes. Each mission as its <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Near the episcopal residence is established a training-school for native catechists. Religious instruction and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for white children are secured by two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at Port-Vila: a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys, conducted by the Little Brothes of Mary; one for girls, under the sisters of the mission who also serve the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at Port-Vila and conduct at Mallicolo a <em>cr&egrave;che</em> for the little <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. Conversions from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> progress slowly, but continuously. The native <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, now numbering rather more than one thousand, are well instructed and faithful to their religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. There are about 600 white <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and this number is increasing rapidly, both by births and by immigration.
