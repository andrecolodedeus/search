<h1>New Orleans</h1>  

<p>ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW ORLEANS (NOV&AElig; AURELI&AElig;).

<p>Erected 25 April, 1793, as the Diocese of Saint Louis of New Orleans; raised to its present rank and title 19 July, 1850. Its original territory comprised the ancient Louisiana purchase and East and West Florida, being bounded on the north by the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> line, on the west by the Rocky Mountains and the Rio Perdito, on the east by the Diocese of Baltimore, and on the south by the Diocese of Linares and the <a href="../cathen/05208c.htm">Archdiocese of Durango</a>. The present boundaries include the State of Louisiana, between the twenty-ninth and thirty-first degree of north latitude, an area of 23,208 square miles. The entire territory of Louisiana has undergone a series of changes which divides its history into four distinct periods.
<h2 id="section1">Early colonial period</h2>

<p>The discoverers and pioneers, De Soto, Iberville, La Salle, Bienville, were accompanied by missionaries in their expeditions through the Louisiana Purchase, and in the toilsome beginnings of the first feeble settlements, which were simply military posts, the Cross blazed the way. From the beginning of its history, Louisiana had been placed under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec; in 1696 the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Quebec petitioned the second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec for authority to establish missions in the west, investing the superior sent out by the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> with the powers of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. The field for which they obtained this authority (1 May, 1698), was on both banks of the Mississippi and its tributaries. They proposed to plant their first mission among the Tamarois, but when this became known, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> claimed that tribe as one already under their care; they received the new missionaries with personal cordiality, but felt keenly the official action of Bishop St-Vallier, in what they regarded as an intrusion. Fathers Jolliet de Montigny, Antoine* Davion, and Fran&ccedil;ois Busion de Saint-Cosme were the missionaries sent to found the new missions in the Mississippi Valley. In 1699 Iberville, who had sailed from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, with his two brothers Bienville and Sauvolle, and Father Du Ru, S.J., coming up the estuary of the Mississippi, found Father Montigny among the Tensus Indians. Iberville left Sauvolle in command of the little fort at Biloxi, the first permanent settlement in <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>. Father Bordenave was its first <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, thus beginning a long line of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in Louisiana.

<p>In 1703, Bishop St-Vallier proposed to erect Mobile into a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, and to annex it in perpetuity to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> agreed, and the Parish of <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a> was erected 20 July, 1703; and united to the Seminary of Foreign Missions of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Quebec. Father Roulleaux de la Vente, of the Diocese of Bayeaux, was appointed <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and Father Huve his assistant. The Biloxi settlement being difficulty of access from the sea, Bienville thought it unsuitable for the headquarters of the province. In 1718, taking with him fifty men, he selected Tchoutchouma, the present site of New Orleans, about 110 miles from the mouth of the Mississippi, where there was a deserted Indian village. Bienville directed his men to clear the grounds and erect buildings. The city was laid out according to the plans of the Chevalier Le Blond de La Tour, chief engineer of the colony, the plans including a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, which Bienville decided to dedicate under the invocation of St. Louis. The old St. Louis <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> stands today on the site of this first <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, and the presbytery in Cathedral Alley is the site of the first modest <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> house. Bienville called the city New Orleans after the Duc d'Orl&eacute;ans, and the whole territory Louisiana, or <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a>.

<p>In August, 1717, the Duc d'Orl&eacute;ans, as Regent of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, issued letters patent establishing a joint-stock company to be called "The Company of the West", to which Louisiana was transferred. The company was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to build churches at its own expense wherever it should establish settlements; also to maintain the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> number of duly approved <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to preach, perform Divine service and administer the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> under the authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec. Bienville experienced much opposition from the Company of the West in his attempt to remove the colony from Biloxi. In 1721 Fr. Francis-Xavier de Charlevoix, S.J., one of the first historians of Louisiana, made a tour of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a> from the Lakes to the Mississippi, visiting New Orleans, which he describes as "a little village of about one hundred cabins dotted here and there, a large wooden warehouse in which I said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in course of construction and two storehouses". But under Bienville's direction the city soon took shape, and, with the consent of the company, the colony was moved to this site in 1723. Father Charlevoix reported on the great spiritual destitution of the province occasioned by the missions being scattered so far apart and the scarcity of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and this compelled the council of the company to make efforts to improve conditions. Accordingly, the company applied to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec, and on 16 May, 1722, Louisiana was divided into three <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> sections. The district north of the Ohio was entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> and the Priests of the Foreign Missions of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Quebec; that between the Mississippi and the Rio Perdito, to the Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Fathers with headquarters at <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> were recalled, not long after, and their district was given to to <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>.

<p>A different arrangement was made for the Indian and new French settlements on the lower Mississippi. Because of the remoteness of this district from Quebec, Father Louis-Fran&ccedil;ois Duplessis de Mornay, a <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> of Meudon, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, at Bishop St-Vallier's request, coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec, 22 April, 1714. Bishop St-Vallier appointed him <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> for Louisiana, but he never came to America, although he eventually succeeded to the See of Quebec. When the Company of the West applied to him for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the lower Mississippi Valley he offered the more populous field of colonists to the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Fathers</a> of the province of Champaigne, who, however, did not take any immediate steps, and it was not until 1720 that any of the order came to Louisiana. Father Jean-Matthieu de Saint-Anne is the first whose name is recorded. He signs himself in 1720 in the register of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of New Orleans. The last entry of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> in Mobile is that of Rev. Alexander Huve, 13 January, 1721. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> came directly from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and consequently found application to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec long and tedious; Father Matthieu therefore applied to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for special power for fifteen missions under his charge, representing that the great distance from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec made it practically impossible for him to apply to the Bishop. A brief was really issued (Michael a Tugio, "Bullarium Ord. FF. Minor. S.P. Francisci Capucinorum", Fol. 1740-52; BLI., pp. 322, 323), and Father Matthieu seems to have assumed that it exempted him from episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, for, on 14 March, 1723, he signs the register "P&egrave;re Matthieu, Vicaire Apostolique et Cur&eacute; de la Mobile".



<p>In 1722 Bishop Mornay entrusted the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> of the Indians to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who were to establish missions in all parts of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> with residence at New Orleans, but were not to exercise any <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> function there without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, though they were to minister to the French in the Illinois District, with the Priests of the Foreign Missions, where the superior of each body was a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, just as the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> superior was at New Orleans. In the spring of 1723 Father Raphael du Luxembourg arrived to assume his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as superior of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> Mission in <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>. It was a difficult task that the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> had assumed. Their congregations were scattered over a large area; there was much poverty, suffering, and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of religion. Father Raphael, in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> archives, says that when he landed in New Orleans he could hardly secure a room for himself and his brethren to occupy pending the rebuilding of the presbytery, much less one to convert into a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>; for the population seemed indifferent to all that savoured of religion. There were less than thirty <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> at Mass on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>; yet, undismayed, the missionaries set to work and saw their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> rewarded with a greater reverence for religion and more faithful attendance at church. In 1725 New Orleans had become an important settlement, the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> having a flock of six hundred <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. Mobile had declined to sixty <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01592a.htm">Apache Indians</a> (Catholic) numbered sixty <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. There were six at Balize, two hundred at St. Charles or Les Allemandes, one hundred at Point Coup&eacute;e, six at <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">Natchez</a>, fifty at <a href="../cathen/10710a.htm">Natchitoches</a> and the other missions which are not named in the "Bullarium Capucinorum" (Vol. VIII, p. 330).

<p>The founder of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Mission in New Orleans was Father Nicolas-Ignatius de Beaubois, who was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> for his district. He visited New Orleans and returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to obtain Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> for his mission. Being also commissioned by Bienville to obtain sisters of some order to assume charge of a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, he applied to the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, who accepted the call. The royal patent authorizing the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> to found a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in Louisiana was issued 18 September, 1726. Mother Mary Trancepain of St. Augustine, with seven professed <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> from <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, Le Havre, <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a>, Ploermel, Hennebon, and Elboeuf, a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a>, Madeline Hauchard, and two seculars, met at the infirmary at Hennebon on 12 January, 1727, and, accompanied by Fathers Tartarin and <a href="../cathen/05144a.htm">Doutreleau</a>, set sail for Louisiana. They reached New Orleans on 6 August to open the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> within the present limits of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a>. As the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was not ready for their reception, the governor gave up his own residence to them. The history of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> from their departure from <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> through a period of thirty years in <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, is told by Sister Madeline Hauchard in a diary still preserved in the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in New Orleans, and which forms, with Father Charlevoix's history, the principal record of those early days. On 7 August, 1727, the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> began in Louisiana the work which has since continued without interruption. They opened a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for the care of the sick and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for poor children, also an academy which is now the oldest <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institution</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in which the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> then took up their abode still stands, the oldest conventual structure in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and the oldest building within the limits of the Louisiana Purchase. In 1824 the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> removed to the lower portion of the city, and the old <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> became first the episcopal residence and then the <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">diocesan chancery</a>.

<p>Meanwhile Father Mathurin le Petit, S.J., established a mission among the Chocktaws; Father Du Poisson among the Arkansas; <a href="../cathen/05144a.htm">Father Doutreleau</a>, on the Wabash; Fathers Tartarin and Le Boulenger, at Kaskaskia; Father Guymonneau among the Metchogameas; Father Souel, among the <a href="../cathen/15732d.htm">Yazoos</a>; <a href="../cathen/02351b.htm">Father Baudouin</a>, among the Chickasaws. The Natchez Indians, provoked by the tyranny and rapacity of Chopart, the French commandant, in 1729 nearly destroyed all these missions. Father Du Poisson and Father Souel were killed by the Indians. As an instance of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> implanted in the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> about this time there was received into the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> order at New Orleans, Mary Turpin, daughter of a <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Father and an Illinois mother. She died a professed <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> in 1761, at the age of fifty-two, with the distinction of being the first American-born <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> in this country. From the beginning of the colony at Biloxi the immigration of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> had been small. Bienville made constant appeals to the mother country to send honest wives and mothers. From time to time ships freighted with girls would arrive; they came over in charge of the <a href="../cathen/07031a.htm">Grey Nuns</a> of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> and a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and were sent by the king to be married to the colonists. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Quebec was also charged with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of sending out young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who were known to be good and virtuous. As a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of her respectability, each girl was furnished by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with a curiously wrought casket; they are known in Louisiana history as "casket girls". Each band of girls, on arriving at New Orleans, was confided to the care of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> until they were married to colonists able to provide for their support. Many of the best <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the state are proud to trace their descent from "casket girls".

<p>The city was growing and developing; a better class of immigrant was pouring in, and Father Charlevoix, on his visit in 1728, wrote to the Duchesse de Lesdigui&egrave;res: "My hopes, I think, are well founded that this wild and <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> place, which the reeds and trees still cover, will be one day, and that not far distant, a city of opulence, and the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of a rich colony." His words were prophetic; New Orleans was fast developing, and early chronicles say that it suggested the splendours of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. There was a governor with a military staff, bringing to the city the manners and splendour of the Court of <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a>, and the manners and usages of the mother country stamped on Louisiana life characteristics in marked contrast to the life of any other colony. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> of New Orleans had no <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> residence, but directed the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, and had charge of their private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and a plantation where, in 1751, they introduced into <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> the culture of the sugar-cane, the orange, and the fig. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> established missions wherever they could. Bishop St-Vallier had been succeeded by Bishop de Mournay, who never went to Quebec, but resigned the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, after five years. His successor, Henri-Marie Du Breuil de Pontbriand, appointed Father de Beaubois, S.J., his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> in <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Fathers</a> refused to recognize Father de Beaubois's authority, claiming, under an agreement of the Company of the West with the coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, de Mornay, that the superior of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> was, in perpetuity, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the province, and that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> could appoint no other. Succeeding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Quebec declared, however, that they could not, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, admit that the assent of a coadjutor and <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to an agreement with a trading company had forever deprived every <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Quebec to act as freely in Louisiana as in any other part of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. This incident gave rise to some friction between the two orders which has been spoken of derisively by Louisiana historians, notably by Gayarr&eacute;, as "The War of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>". The archives of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, as also the records of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> in <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, show that it was simply a question of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, which gave rise to a discussion so petty as to be unworthy of notice. Historians exaggerate this beyond all importance, while failing to chronicle the shameful spoilation of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> by the French Government, which suddenly settled the question forever.

<p>In 1761 the Parliaments of several provinces of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had condemned the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and measures were taken against them in the kingdom. They were expelled from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and the Superior Council of Louisiana, following the example, on 9 July, 1763, just ten years before the order was <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppressed</a> by <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a>, passed an act suppressing the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> throughout the province, declaring them dangerous to royal authority, to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and to the public safety. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were charged with neglecting their mission, with having developed their plantation, and with having usurped the office of <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. To the first charge the record of their labours was sufficient refutation; to the second, it was assuredly to the credit of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> that they made their plantation so productive as to maintain their missionaries; to the third the actions of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Quebec in appointing the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and that of the Superior council itself in sustaining him was the answer. Nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was carried out, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits'</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was confiscated, and they were forbidden to use the name of their <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> or to wear their habit. Their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was sold for $180,000. All their <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> were levelled to the ground, leaving exposed even the vaults where the dead were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were ordered to give up their missions, to return to New Orleans and to leave on the first vessel sailing for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> forgetting their differences interfered on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; and finally their petitions unavailing went to the river bank to receive the returning <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, offered them a home alongside their own, and in every way showed their disapproval of the Council's action. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> deeply grateful left the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> all the books they had been able to save from the spoilation.

<p>Father Boudoin, S.J., the benefactor of the colony, who had introduced the culture of sugar-cane and oranges from <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">San Domingo</a>, and figs from Provence, a man to whom the people owed much and to whom Louisiana today owes so much of its prosperity, alone remained. He was now seventy-two years old and had spent thirty-five in the colony. He was broken in health and too ill to leave his room. They dragged him through the streets when prominent citizens intervened and one wealthy planter, &acirc;tienne de Bor&eacute;, who had first succeeded in the granulation of sugar, defied the authorities and took Father Boudoin to his home and sheltered him until his death in 1766. The most monstrous part of the order of expulsion was that, not only were the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in lower Louisiana &#151; many of which were the only places where <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, whites and Indians, and <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a>, could worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> &#151; levelled to the ground, but the Council carried out the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> even in the Illinois district which had been ceded to the King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and which was no longer subject to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> or Louisiana. They ordered even the vestments and plate to be delivered to the king's attorney. Thus was a vast territory left destitute of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and altars, and the growth of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> retarded for many years. Of the ten <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> left to administer this immense territory, five were retained in New Orleans; the remainder were scattered over various missions. It is interesting to note that the only native Louisiana <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at this time, and the first to enter the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, Rev. Bernard Viel, born in New Orleans 1 October, 1736, was among the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> expelled from the colony. He died in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 1821. The inhabitants of New Orleans then numbered four thousand.
<h2 id="section2">Spanish period</h2>

<p>In 1763 Louisiana was ceded to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15122b.htm">Antonia Ulloa</a> was sent over to take possession. The colonists were bitterly opposed to the cession, and finally rose in arms against the governor, giving him three days in which to leave the town. (See <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">LOUISIANA</a>.) The Spanish Government resolved to punish the parties which had so insulted its representative, <a href="../cathen/15122b.htm">Don Ulloa</a>, and sent Alexander O'Reilly to assume the office of governor. Lafr&eacute;ni&egrave;re, President of the Council, who chiefly instigated the passing of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> from the colony, and the rebellion against the Government, was tried by court martial and with six of his partners in his scheme, was shot in the Palace d'Armes. O'Reilly reorganized the province after the Spanish model. The <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> taken by the officials shows that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Immaculate Conception was then officially recognized in the Spanish dominions. "I __________ appointed __________ swear before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> . . . to maintain . . . the mystery of the <a href="../cathen/07674d.htm">Immaculate Conception</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady, the Virgin Mary</a>."

<p>The change of government affected <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>. The Province of Louisiana passed under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Santiago de Cuba, the Right Rev. James Jos&eacute; de Echeverr&iacute;a, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> began to fill the places of their French brethren. Contradictory reports reached the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> about conditions in <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> and he sent Father Cirilo de Barcelona with four <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> to New Orleans. These <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were Fathers Francisco, Angel de Revillagades, Louis de Quitanilla, and Aleman. They reached New Orleans, 19 July, 1773. The genial ways of the French brethren seemed <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> to the stern Spanish disciplinarian, and he informed the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04558c.htm">Cuba</a> concerning what he considered "lax methods of conduct and administration". Governor Unzaga, however, interfered on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, and wrote to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> censuring the Spanish <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>. This offended the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and both referred the matter to the Spanish Court. The Government expressed no opinion, but advised the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> and governor to compromise, and so preserve harmony between the civil and <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>. Some Louisiana historians, Charles Gayarr&eacute; among others, speak of the depravity of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of that period. These charges are not borne out by contemporary testimony; the archives of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> witness that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> performed their work faithfully. These charges as a rule sprang from monastic prejudices or secular antipathies. One of the first acts of Father Cirilo as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the St. Louis Cathedral was to have the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> printed in both French and Spanish.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Santiago de Cuba resolved to remedy the deplorable conditions in <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, where confirmation had never been administered. In view of his inability to visit this distant portion of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, he asked for the appointment of an <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>, who would take up his abode in New Orleans, and thence visit the missions on the Mississippi as well as those in <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, Pensacola, and St. Augustine. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> appointed Father Cirilo de Barcelona <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Tricali and auxiliary of Santiago. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in Cuba in 1781 and proceeded to New Orleans where for the first time the people enjoyed the presence of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. A saintly man, he infused new life into the province. The whole of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> and the Floridas were under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. According to official records of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Louisiana in 1785, the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Louis, New Orleans, has a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, four assistants; and there was a resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at each of the following points: Terre aux Boeufs, St. Charles, St. John the Baptist, St. James, Ascension, St. Gabriel's at Iberville, Point Coupee, Attakapas, Opelousas, <a href="../cathen/10710a.htm">Natchitoches</a>, <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">Natchez</a>, St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/06413f.htm">St. Genevieve</a>, and at Bernard or Manchac (now Galveston). On 25 November, 1785, Bishop Cirilo appointed as <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of New Orleans Rev. Antonio Ildefonso Morenory Arze de Sedella, one of the six <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> who had come to the colony in 1779. Father Antonio (popularly known as "P&egrave;re Antoine*") was destined to exert a remarkable influence in the colony. Few <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have been more assailed by historians, but a careful comparison of the ancient records of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> with the traditions that cluster about his memory show that he did not deserve on the one hand the indignities which Gayarr&eacute; and Shea heap upon him, nor yet the excessive honours with which tradition had <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> him. From the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> archives it has been proven that he was simply an earnest <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> striving to do what he thought his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> amid many difficulties.

<p>In 1787 a number of unfortunate Acadians came at the expense of the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and settled near Plaquemines, Terre aux Boeufs, Bayou Lafourche, Attakapas, and Opelousas, adding to the already thrifty colony. They brought with them the precious register of St. Charles aux Mines in Acadia extending from 1689 to 1749 only six years before their cruel deportation. They were deposited for safe keeping with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of St. Gabriel at Iberville and are now in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> archives. St. Augustine being returned to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> by the treaty of peace of 1783, the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> made efforts to provide for the future of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in that ancient province. As many English people had settled there and in West Florida, notably at Baton Rouge and Natchez, Charles III applied to the Irish College for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to attend to the English-speaking population. Accordingly Rev. Michael O'Reilly and Reverend Thomas Hasset were sent to Florida. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship was restored, the city at once resuming its own old aspect. Rev. William Savage, a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> of great repute, Rev. Michael Lamport, Rev. Gregory White, Rev. Constantine Makenna, Father Joseph Denis, and a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> with six fathers of his order, were sent to labour in <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>. They were distributed through the Natchez and Baton Rouge districts, and were the first <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to come to <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, the pioneers of a long and noble line to whom this archdiocese owes much. In 1787 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> divided the Diocese of Santiago de Cuba, erected the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of St. Christopher of <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a>, <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, and the Floridas, with the Right Rev. Joseph de Trespalacios of Porto Rico as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the Right Rev. Cirilo de Barcelona as auxiliary, with the special direction of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> and the two Floridas. Louisiana thus formed a part of the <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Diocese of Havana</a>.

<p>Near Fort Natchez the site for a church was purchased on April 11, 1788. The earliest incumbent of whom any record was kept was Father Francis Lennan. Most of the people of <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">Natchez</a> were <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">English Protestants</a> or Americans, who had sided with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. They enjoyed absolute religious freedom, no attempt to proselytize was ever made. On <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, 21 March, 1788, New Orleans was swept by a conflagration in which nine hundred buildings, including the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, with the adjoining <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, the house of Bishop Cirilo and the Spanish School were reduced to ashes. From the ruins of the old irregularly built French City rose the stately Spanish City, old New Orleans, practically unchanged as it exists today. Foremost among the public-spirited men of that time was Don Andreas Almonaster y Roxas, of a noble Andalusian <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and royal standard bearer for the colony. He had made a great fortune in New Orleans, and at a cost of $50,000 he built and gave to the city the St. Louis Cathedral. He rebuilt the house for the use of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the charity <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at a cost of $114,000. He also rebuilt the town hall and the Cabildo, the buildings on either side of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, the boys' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, and founded the Leper Hospital.

<p>Meanwhile rapid assimilation had gone on in <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>. Americans began to make their homes in New Orleans and in 1791 the insurrection of <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">San Domingo</a> drove there many hundreds of wealthy noble refugees. The archives of the New Orleans Diocese show that the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> petitioned <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> on 20 May, 1790, to erect Louisiana and the Floridas into a separate see, and on April 9, 1793, a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> for the dismemberment of the <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Diocese of Havana</a>, <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, and the Provinces of East and West Florida was issued. It provided for the erection of the See of St. Louis of New Orleans, which was to include all the Louisiana Province and the Provinces of East and West Florida. The Bishops of Mexico, Agalopi, <a href="../cathen/10282a.htm">Michoacan</a> and Caracas were to contribute, <em>pro rata</em>, a fund for the support of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of New Orleans, until such time as the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> would be self-sustaining. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> left the choice of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for a new see to the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and he on 25 April, 1793, wrote to Bishop Cirilo relieving him of his office of auxiliary, and directing him to return immediately to Catalonia with a salary of one thousand dollars a year, which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a> was to contribute. Bishop Cirilo returned to Havana and seems to have resided with the Hospital Friars, while endeavouring to obtain his salary, so that he might return to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. It is not known where Bishop Cirilo died in poverty and humiliation.

<p>The Right Rev. Luis Pe&ntilde;alver y C&aacute;rdenas was appointed first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the new See of St. Louis of New Orleans. He was a native of <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a>, born 3 April, 1719, and had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> of his native city, receiving his degree in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1771. He was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of irreproachable character, and a skillful director of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a> in 1793. The St. Louis <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, now raised to the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, was dedicated 23 December, 1794. A letter from the king, 14 August, 1794, decreed that its donor, Don Almonaster, was authorized to occupy the most prominent seat in the church, second only to that of the viceregal patron, the intendant of the province, and to receive the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a> during the Mass. Don Almonaster died in 1798 and was buried under the altar of the Sacred Heart.

<p>Bishop Pe&ntilde;alver arrived in New Orleans, 17 July, 1795. In a report to the king and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> he bewailed the indifference he found as to the practice of religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. He condemned the laxity of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> among the men, and the universal practice of <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a> among the slaves. The invasion of many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> not of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the toleration of the Government in admitting all classes of adventurers for purposes of trade, had brought about disrespect for religion. He deplored the establishment of trading posts and of a lodge of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasons</a>, which counted among its members city officials, officers of the garrison, merchants and foreigners. He believed the people clung to their French traditions. He said that the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> possessed "their bodies but not their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>". He declared that "even the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, from whom good results were obtained in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of girls, were so decidedly French in their inclination that they refused to admit <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who wished to become members of their order, and many were in tears because they were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to read spiritual exercises in Spanish books". It was a gloomy picture he presented, but he set faithfully to work, and on 21 December, 1795, called a synod, the first and only one held in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of colonial New Orleans. He also issued a letter of instruction to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> deploring the fact that many of his flock were more than five hundred leagues away, and how impossible it was to repair at one and the same time to all. He enjoined the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> to walk in the footsteps of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and in all things to fulfill their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. This letter of instruction bearing his signature is preserved in the archives of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and, with the call for the synod, forms the only documents signed by the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of New Orleans.

<p>Bishop Pe&ntilde;alver everywhere showed himself active in the cause of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> progress and was a generous benefactor of the poor. He was promoted to the See of <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, 20 July, 1801. Before his departure he appointed, as vicars-general, Rev. Thomas Canon Hasset and Rev. Patrick Walsh, who became officially recognized as "Governors of the Diocese".

<p>Territorially from this ancient see have been erected the Archbishoprics of St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">Natchez</a>, <a href="../cathen/06372a.htm">Galveston</a>, <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a>, <a href="../cathen/09295a.htm">Little Rock</a>, St. Augustine, <a href="../cathen/08602a.htm">Kansas City</a>, <a href="../cathen/13356b.htm">St. Joseph</a>, <a href="../cathen/04640a.htm">Davenport</a>, <a href="../cathen/03651a.htm">Cheyenne</a>, <a href="../cathen/04605b.htm">Dallas</a>, <a href="../cathen/15658b.htm">Winona</a>, <a href="../cathen/05188c.htm">Duluth </a>, Concordia, <a href="../cathen/11249b.htm">Omaha</a>, <a href="../cathen/14016b.htm">Sioux Falls</a>, <a href="../cathen/11230c.htm">Oklahoma</a>, St. Cloud, Bismark, and <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>.

<p>Right Rev. Francis Porro y Peinade, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> of the Convent of the Holy Apostles, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was appointed to succeed Bishop Pe&ntilde;alver. But he never took possession of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Some old chronicles in Louisiana say that he was never <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>; others that he was, and died on the eve of leaving <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Bishop Portier (Spalding's "Life of Bishop Flaget"), says that he was translated to the See of Terrazona. The See of New Orleans remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> many years after the departure of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Pe&ntilde;alver.

<p>In 1798 the Duc d'Orl&eacute;ans (afterwards King Luis-Philippe of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>) with his two brothers, the Duc de Montpensier and the Count de Beaujolais, visited New Orleans. They were received with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and when Louis-Philippe became King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> he remembered many of those who had entertained him when in exile, and was generous to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the old French province.
<h2 id="section3">French and American period</h2>

<p>By the Treaty of San Ildefonse, the Spanish King on 1 October, 1800, engaged to retrocede Louisiana to the French Republic six months after certain conditions and stipulations had been executed on the part of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> deferred the appointment of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p>On 30 April, 1803, without waiting for the actual transfer of the province, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> by the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> sold Louisiana to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. De Laussat, the French Commissioner, had reached New Orleans on 26 March, 1803, to take possession of the province in the name of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> was preparing to evacuate and general confusion prevailed. Very Rev. Thomas Hasset, the administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was directed to address each <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and ascertain whether they preferred to return with the Spanish forces or to remain in Louisiana; also to obtain from each <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> an inventory of the plate, vestments, and other articles in the church which had been given by the Spanish Government. Then came the news of the cession of the province to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. On 20 April, 1803, De Laussat formally surrendered the colony to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> commissioners. The people felt it keenly, and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> archives show the difficulties to be surmounted. Father Hasset, as administrator, issued a letter to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> on 10 June, 1803, announcing the new domination, and notifying all of the permission to return to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> if they desired. Several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> signified their desire to follow the Spanish standard. The question of withdrawal was also discussed by the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. Thirteen out of the twenty-one choir <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> were in favour of returning to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> or going to Havana. De Laussat went to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and assured them that they could remain unmolested. Notwithstanding this Mother Saint Monica and eleven others, with nearly all the lay sisters applied to the Marquis de Casa Calvo to convey them to Havana. Six choir <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> and two lay sisters remained to begin again the work in <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>. They elected Mother St. Xavier Fargeon as superioress, and resumed all the exercises of community life, maintaining their academy, day <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and instructions for coloured people in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>. Father Hasset wrote to Bishop Carroll, 23 December, 1803, that the retrocession of the province to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a> impelled him to present to his consideration the present <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a> of Louisiana, not doubting that it would soon fall under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The ceded province consisted of twenty-one <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> some of which were vacant. "The churches were", to use his own words, "all descent <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> and comfortably supplied with ornaments and everything <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for divine services. . . . Of twenty-six <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> in the province only four had agreed to continue their respective stations under the French Government; and whether any more would remain under that of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>." Father Hasset said that for his own part he felt could not with propriety, relinquish his post, and consequently awaited superior orders to take his departure. He said that the Rev. Patrick Walsh, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and auxiliary governor of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, had declared that he would not abandon his post providing he could hold it with propriety. Father Hasset died in April 1804. Father Antonio Sedella had returned to New Orleans in 1791, and resumed his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the St. Louis Cathedral to which he had been appointed by Bishop Cirilo. After the cession a dispute arose between him and Father Walsh, and the latter, 27 March, 1805, established the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> as the only place in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> for the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>. On 21 March, 1804, the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> addressed a letter to Thomas Jefferson, President of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, in which they solicited the passage of an Act of Congress guaranteeing their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. The president replied reassuring the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>. "The principles of the Constitution of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>" he wrote, "are a sure guaranty to you that it will be preserved to you sacred and inviolate, and that your institution will be permitted to govern itself according to its own <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> rules without interference from the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>. Whatever diversity of shades may appear in the religious opinions of our fellow citizens, the charitable objects of your Institution cannot be of indifference to any; and its furtherance of the wholesome purpose by training up its young members in the way they should go cannot fail to insure the patronage of the government it is under. Be assured that it will meet with all the protection my office can give it. "

<p>Father Walsh, administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, died on 22 August, 1806, and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. The Archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the province, to which the <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Diocese of Louisiana</a> and the Floridas belonged, was vacant, and not one of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Spanish province would interfere in the New Orleans Diocese, though the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a> extended his authority once more over the Florida portion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. As the death of Father Walsh left the diocese without anyone to govern it, Bishop Carroll, who had meanwhile informed himself of the condition of affairs, resolved to act under the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 1 Sept., 1805, and assume administration. Father Antoine* had been accused of intriguing openly against the Government; but beyond accusations made to Bishop Carroll there is nothing to substantiate them. He was much <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> in New Orleans and some of his friends desired to obtain the influence of the French Government to have him appointed to the Bishopric of Louisiana. However, there is in the archives of the New Orleans <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> a letter from Father Antoine* to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> declaring that having heard that some members of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> had applied to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to have him appointed to the Bishopric of Louisiana, he hereby declared to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> that he would not consider the position, that he was unworthy of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and too old to do any good. He would be grateful to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> if he would cut short any further efforts in that direction.

<p>Bishop Carroll wrote to James Madison, Secretary of State (17 November, 1806) in regard to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> and the recommending of two or three <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a> one of whom might be appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of New Orleans. Mr. Madison replied that the matter being purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> the Government could not interfere. He seemed, however, to share the opinion of Bishop Carroll in regard to the character and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of Father Antoine. In 1806 a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> confided Louisiana to the care of Bishop Carroll of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and created him administrator apostolic. He appointed Rev. John Olivier (who had been at Cohokia until 1803), <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of Louisiana and <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> Nuns at New Orleans. Father Olivier presented his documents to the Governor of Louisiana, and also wrote to Father Antoine* Sedella apprising him of the action of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. Father Antoine* called upon Father Olivier, but he was not satisfied as to Bishop Carroll's authorization. The <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> published the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> letter at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. The Rev. Thomas Flynn wrote from St. Louis, 8 Nov., 1806, that the trustees were about to install him. He describes the church as a good one with a tolerably good bell, a <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>, and commodious pews. The house for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was convenient but in need of repair. Except Rev. Fr. Maxwell there was scarcely a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in Upper Louisiana in 1807.

<p>As the original <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> issued by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to Bishop Carroll had not been so distinct and clear as to obviate objections, he applied to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> asking that more ample and distinct authorizations be sent. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> placed the Province of Louisiana under Bishop Carroll who was requested to send to the New Orleans Diocese either Rev. Charles Nerinckx, or some secular or religious <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, with the rank of administrator Apostolic and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of an ordinary to continue only at the good will of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> according to instructions to be forwarded by the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. Bishop Carroll did not act immediately, but on 18 August, 1812, appointed Rev. Louis V. G. Dubourg Administrator Apostolic of the <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Diocese of Louisiana</a> and the Two Floridas. Dr. Dubourg's authority was at once recognized by Fr. Antoine* and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and Great Britain was in progress, and as the year 1814 drew to a close, Dr. Dubourg issued a pastoral letter calling on the people to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the success of the American arms. During the battle of New Orleans (8 Jan., 1815) Gen. Andrew Jackson sent a messenger to the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> to ask for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for his success. When victory came he sent a courier thanking the sisters for their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and he decreed a public thanksgiving; a solemn high <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated in the St. Louis Cathedral, 23 January, 1815. The condition of religion in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was not encouraging, seven out of fourteen <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were vacant. Funds were also needed and Dr. Dubourg went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to ask for aid for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. There the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 18 September, 1818, and on 24 September he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Cardinal Joseph Pamfili (see DUBOURG).

<p>Bishop Dubourg proposed the division of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and the erection of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in Upper Louisiana, but the news of troubles among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in New Orleans and the attempt of the trustees to obtain a charter depriving the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> so alarmed him that he petitioned the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> to allow him to take up his residence in St. Louis and establish his <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> there. He sailed from <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> for New Orleans (28 June, 1817), accompanied by five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, four <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, eleven seminarians and three <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a>. He took possession of the church at <a href="../cathen/06413f.htm">St. Genevieve</a>, a ruined wooden structure, and was installed by Bishop Flaget. He then established the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Bois Brule ("The Barrens"), and brought from Bardstowm, where they were temporarily sojourning, <a href="../cathen/01470c.htm">Father Andreis</a>, Father Rosati, and the seminarians who accompanied him from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03711c.htm">Brothers of the Christian Doctrine</a> opened a boys' <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/06413f.htm">St. Genevieve</a>. At his request the Religious of the Sacred Heart, comprising Madames Philippe Duchesne, Berthold, Andr&eacute;, and two lay sisters reaching New Orleans, 30 May, 1818, proceeded from St. Louis and opened their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Florissant. In 1821 they established a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Grand Coteau, Louisiana. The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> made great progress throughout the diocese. On 1 January, 1821, Bishop Dubourg held the first synod since the Purchase of Louisiana. Where he found ten superannuated <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> there were now forty active, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> men at work. Still appeals came from all part of the immense diocese for priests; among others he received a letter from the banks of the Columbia in <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> begging him to send a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to minister to 1500 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> there who had never had anyone to attend to them. The <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> Nuns, frequently annoyed by being summoned to court, appealed to the legislature claiming the privileges they had enjoyed under the French and Spanish dominations. Their ancient <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> were recognized and a law was passed, 28 January, 1818, enacting that where the testimony of a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> was required it should be taken at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> by commission. It had a far-reaching effect in later days upon legislation in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in similar cases.

<p>Spain by treaty ceded Florida to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, 22 February, 1818, and Bishop Dubourg was then able to extend his episcopal care to that part of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the vast extent of which prompted him to form plans for the erection of a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> west of the Alleghenies. This did not meet with the approval of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>; he then proposed to divide the <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Diocese of Louisiana</a> and the Floridas, establishing a see at New Orleans embracing Lower Louisiana, <a href="../cathen/10394a.htm">Mississippi</a>, <a href="../cathen/01240a.htm">Alabama</a>, and Florida. Finally, 13 August, 1822, the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> of Mississippi and Alabama was formed with the Reverend Joseph Rosati, elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tenagra, as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. But Archbishop Ambrose Mar&eacute;chal remonstrated because in establishing this vicariate the propaganda had inadvertently invaded the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> as the whole of those states except a small portion south of the thirty-first degree between Perdido and Pearl Island belonged to the <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Diocese of Baltimore</a>. Bishop Rosati also wrote representing the poverty and paucity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/10394a.htm">Mississippi</a> and Alabama, and the necessity of remaining at the head of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Finally his arguments and the protests of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> prevailed, and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> suppressed the vicariate, appointing Dr. Rosati coadjutor to Bishop Dubourg to reside at St. Louis. Bishop Rosati was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Bishop Dubourg at Donaldsonville, 25 March, 1824, and proceeded at once to St. Louis. In 1823 Bishop Dubourg took up the subject of the Indian missions and laid before the Government the necessity of a plan for the civilization and conversion of the Indians west of the Mississippi. His plan met with the approval of the Government and an allowance of $200 a year was assigned to four or five missionaries, to be increased if the project proved successful.

<p>On 29 August, 1825, <a href="../cathen/01240a.htm">Alabama</a> and the Floridas were erected into a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a>, with Rev. Michael Portier the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> divided the <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Diocese of Louisiana</a> (18 July, 1826), and established the See of New Orleans with Louisiana as its diocese, and the Vicariate Apostolic of Mississippi to be administered by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of New Orleans. The country north of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> was made the Diocese of St. Louis, Bishop Rosati being transferred to that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Bishop Dubourg, though a man of vast projects and of great service to the church, was little versed in business methods; discouraged at the difficulties that rose to thwart him he resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and was transferred to Mantauban. Bishop Rosati, appointed to the See of New Orleans, declined the appointment, urging that his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of English qualified him to labour better in <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, and Arkansas, while he was not sufficiently versed in French to address the people of New Orleans with success. On 20 March, 1827, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> brief arrived allowing him to remain in St. Louis but charging him for a while with the administration of the See of New Orleans. He appointed Rev. Leo Raymond de Neckere, C. M., <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and strongly recommended his appointment for the vacant see. Father de Neckere, then in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> wither he had gone to recuperate his health, was summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Bishop de Neckere was born, 6 June, 1800, at Wevelghem, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and while a seminarian at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, was accepted for the Diocese of New Orleans by Bishop Dubourg. He joined the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, 13 October, 1822. On 23 February, 1832, he convoked a synod attended by twenty-one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Regulations were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> for better discipline and steps were taken to form an association for the dissemination of good literature.

<p>Americans were now pouring into New Orleans. The ancient French limits had long since disappeared. Such was the enterprise on all sides that in 1832 New Orleans ranked in importance immediately after New York, Philadelphia, and <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>. It was the greatest cotton and sugar market in the world. <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> emigration also set in, and a church for the English-speaking people was an absolute necessity as the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the old <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> were the only places of worship in New Orleans. A site was bought on Camp Street near Julia, a frame church, St. Patrick's, was erected and dedicated on 21 April, 1833. Rev. Adam Kindelon was the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of this, the first English-speaking congregation of New Orleans. The foundation of this <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> was one of the last official acts of Bishop de Neckere. The year was one of sickness and death. Cholera and yellow fever raged. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were kept busy day and night, and the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, Father B. Richards and Fathers Marshall, Tichitoli, Kindelon fell victims to their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Fr. de Neckere, who had retired to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Convent, La., in hope of restoring his shattered health, returned at once to the city upon the outbreak of the epidemic, and began visiting and ministering to the plague-stricken. Soon he too was seized with fever and succumbed ten days later, 5 September, 1833. Just before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> death there arrived in New Orleans a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who was destined to exercise for many years an influence upon the life and progress of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the Commonwealth, Father James Ignatius Mullen; he was immediately appointed to the vacant rectorship of St. Patrick's. Upon the death of Bishop De Neckere, Fathers Anthony Blanc and V. Lavadi&egrave;re, S.J., became the administrators of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In November, undismayed by the epidemic which still continued, a band of Sisters of Charity set out from Emmitsburg, to take charge of the Charity Hospital of New Orleans. The sisters had come into the diocese about 1832 to assume the direction of the Poydras Asylum, erected by Julian Poydras, a <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenot</a>. Seven of the new colony from Emmitsburg were sent to the asylum, and ten to the Charity Hospital. Bishop de Neckere had invited the Tertiary Sisters of Mount Carmel to make a foundation in New Orleans, which they did on 22 October, 1833, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> being opened.

<p>Father Augustine Jeanjean was selected by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to fill the episcopal vacancy, but he declined, and Father Anthony Blanc was appointed and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 22 November, 1835 (see <a href="../cathen/02592b.htm">ANTHONY BLANC</a>). Bishop Blanc <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the great want of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the need of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, whose ranks had been decimated by age, pestilence, and overwork. To meet this want, Bishop Blanc asked the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to establish a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>. They arrived on 22 January, 1837, and opened a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at Grand Coteau on 5 January, 1838. He then invited the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> and on 20 December, 1838, they arrived and at once opened a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Bayeaux Lafourche. In 1836, Julian Poydras having died, the asylum which he founded passed entirely under <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> auspices, and the Sisters of Charity being compelled to relinquish the direction, St. Patrick's Orphan Asylum, now New Orleans Female Orphan Asylum was founded and placed under their care.

<p>In 1841 the Sisters Marianites of the Holy Cross came to New Orleans to assume charge of St. Mary's Orphan Boys Asylum. They opened also an academy for young ladies and the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> of the Immaculate Conception for girls. The wants of coloured people also deeply concerned Bishop Blanc and he worked assiduously for the proper spiritual care of the slaves. After the insurrection of <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">San Domingo</a> in 1793 a large number of coloured people from that island who were slaveholders themselves took refuge in New Orleans. Thus was created a free coloured population among which successive epidemics played havoc leaving aged and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> to be cared for. Accordingly in 1842 Bishop Blanc and Father Rousselon, V.G., founded the Sisters of the Holy Family, whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> was the care of the coloured <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and the aged coloured poor. It was the first coloured sisterhood founded in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and one of the only two that exist.

<p>Bishop Blanc planned the erection of new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the city of New Orleans, and St. Joseph's and the Annunciation were founded in 1844. The foundation of these <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> greatly diminished the congregation of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the trustees seeing their influence waning entered upon a new <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against religion. Upon the death of Father Aloysius Moni, Bishop Blanc appointed Father C. Maenhaut <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, but the wardens refused to recognize his appointment, claiming the right of patronage formerly enjoyed by the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. They brought an action against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> court, but the judge decided against the trustees, and the case was appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court decided that the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to nominate a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, or the jus patronatus of Spanish law, was abrogated in the state, and the decision of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was sustained. But the wardens refused to recognize this decision and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> ordered the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to withdraw from the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> residence. One of the members of the board, who was a member of the city council, obtained the passage of a law, punishing by fine any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who should perform the burial service over a dead body except in the old mortuary <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> erected in 1826 as part of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. Under this ordinance Rev. Bernard Permoli was prosecuted. The old <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> had long outlived its purpose, and on 18 December, 1842, Judge Preval decided the ordinance illegal, and the Supreme Court of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> sustained his decision. The faithful of St. Patrick's parish having publicly protested against the outrageous proceedings, the tide of public opinion set in strongly against the men who thus defied all church authority. In January, 1843, the latter submitted and received the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> appointed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Soon after the faithful <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the city petitioned the legislature to amend the Act incorporating the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and bring it into harmony with <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. Even after the decision of the Legislature the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> felt he could not treat with the wardens as they defied his authority by authorizing the erection of a monument to <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasons</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cemetery of St. Louis. To free the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, he therefore continued to plan for the organization of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and the erection of new churches. Only one low <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was said at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and that on Sunday. Bishop Blanc convened the third synod of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> on 21 April, at which the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were warned against yielding to the illegal claims of the trustees, and the erection of any church without a deed being first made to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was forbidden. For the churches in which the trustees system still existed special regulations were made, governing the method of keeping accounts. At the close of 1844, the trustees, defeated in the courts and held in contempt by public opinion throughout the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, yielded completely to Bishop Blanc.

<p>The controversy terminated, a period of remarkable activity in the organization of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and the building of new churches set in. The cornerstone of St. Mary's, intended to replace the old <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> attached to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> house, was laid on 16 Feb., 1845; that of St. Joseph's on 16 April, 1846; that of the Annunciation on 10 May, 1846. The <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> founded the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of the Assumption, and were installed in its church on 22 October, 1847. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of <a href="../cathen/10041a.htm">Mater</a> Dolorsa at Carrollton (then a suburb) was founded on 8 Sept.; that of Holy Name of Mary at <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a> on 18 Dec., 1848. In 1849 St. Stephen's parish in the then suburb of Bouligny under the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers and Sts. Peter and Paul came into existence. The cornerstone of the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Alphonsus was laid by the famous Apostle of Temperance, Father Theobald Mathew, on 11 April, 1850; two years later it was found <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to enlarge this church, and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was added. In 1851 the foundation-stone of the church of the Immaculate Conception was laid, on the site of a humbler edifice erected in 1848. This is said to have been the first church in the world dedicated to the Immaculate Conception. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of St. John the Baptist in uppertown and of St. Anne in the French quarter were organized in 1852.

<p>The French congregation of Notre-Dame de Bon Secours was organized on 16 Jan., 1858. In the midst of great progress yellow fever broke out and five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and two Sisters of Charity swelled the roll of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. The devoted services of the Sisters of Charity, especially during the ravages of the yellow fever, in attending the sick and caring for the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> were so highly appreciated by the Legislation that in 1846 the State made them a grant of land near Donaldsonville for the opening of a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, and a general subscription was made throughout the diocese for this purpose. The sisters established themselves in Donaldsonville the same year.

<p>In 1843, anxious to provide for the wants of the increasing German and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> immigration, Bishop Blanc had summoned the Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> to the diocese and the German <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Mary's Assumption was founded by Rev. Czackert of that congregation. In 1847 the work of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which had been temporarily suspended, was resumed under Father Maisounabe as superior, and a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> building was started on 10 June. In the following year Father Maisounabe and a brilliant young <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> associate, Father Blackney, fell victims to yellow fever. The population of New Orleans now numbered over fifty thousand, among whom were many German immigrants. Bishop Blanc turned over the old <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> of the lower portion of the city, and a church was erected which finally resulted in the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> on 26 October, 1847. In 1849 the College of St. Paul was opened at Baton Rouge. On 13 July, 1852, St. Charles College became a corporate institution with with Rev. A. J.  Jourdan, S.J., as president. In 1849 Bishop Blanc attended the seventh council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> at which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> expressed their desire that the See of New Orleans be raised to <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank. On 19 July, 1850, <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> established the Archdiocese of New Orleans, Bishop Blanc being raised to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archiepiscopal</a> dignity. The Province of New Orleans was to embrace New Orleans with Mobile, <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">Natchez</a>, <a href="../cathen/09295a.htm">Little Rock</a>, and Galveston as suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. The spirit of <a href="../cathen/08677a.htm">Knownothingism</a> invaded New Orleans as other parts of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and Archbishop Blanc found himself in the thick of the battle. Public debates were held, conspicuous among those who did yeoman service in crushing the efforts of the party in Louisiana being Hon. Thos. J. Semmes, a distinguished advocate, Rev. Francis Xavier Leray and Rev. N. J. Perche, both afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of New Orleans. Father Perche founded (1844) a French <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> journal "Le Propagateur Catholique", which vigorously assailed the <a href="../cathen/08677a.htm">Knownothing</a> doctrines. On June 6 a mob attacked the office of the paper, and also made a fierce attack on the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, breaking doors and windows and hurling insults at the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>.

<p>In 1853 New Orleans was decimated by the worst outbreak of yellow fever in its history, seven <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and five sisters being among its victims. On 6 March, 1854, the School Sisters of Notre Dame arrived in New Orleans to take charge of St. Joseph's Asylum, founded to furnish homes for those <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphaned</a> by the epidemic. St. Vincent's Orphan Asylum was also opened as a home for foundling and infant <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, and entrusted to the Sisters of Charity. On 29 July, 1853, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> divided the Diocese of New Orleans, which at that time embraced all of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, and established the <a href="../cathen/10710a.htm">See of Natchitoches</a>. The new diocese contained about twenty-five thousand <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, chiefly a rural population, for whom there were only seven churches. The Convent of the Sacred Heart at <a href="../cathen/10710a.htm">Natchitoches</a> was the only religious institution in the new diocese. In 1854 Archbishop Blanc went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and was present at the solemn definition of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Immaculate Conception. In his report to <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> he describes his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> as containing forty quasi-churches, each with a church and one or two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and a residence for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; the city had eighteen churches. The diocese had a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> under the Priests of the Mission with an average of nine students; the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders at work were the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> with three establishments, Priests of the Mission with three, and the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> with two. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 95,000 was made up of natives of French, Spanish, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, or American origin, French, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>. Distinctive <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were increasing. The <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, Religious of the Sacred Heart, Sisters of Holy Charity, Marianites of the Holy Cross, Tertiary <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, School Sisters of Notre Dame and the Coloured Sisters of the Holy Family were doing excellent work. Many abuses had crept in especially with regard to marriage, but after the erection of the new churches with smaller <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> districts, religion had gained steadily and the frequentation of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> was increasing.

<p>In 1855 the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/07403a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Cross</a> came to New Orleans to establish a manual industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the training of the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> boys who had bee rendered homeless by the terrible epidemic of 1853. They established themselves in the lower portion of New Orleans and became inseparably identified with religious and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> progress. In 1879 they opened their college, which is now one of the leading institutions of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>. On 20 January, 1856, the First <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of New Orleans was held, and in January, 1858, Archbishop Blanc held the fourth <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod. In 1859 the Sisters of the Good Shepherd were called by Archbishop Blanc to New Orleans to open a reformatory for girls. Bishop Blanc opened another <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in the same year, and placed it in charge of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers. He convoked the second provincial council on 22 January, 1860. Just before the second session opened he was taken so seriously ill that he could no longer attend the meetings. He rallied and seemed to regain his usual health, but he died 20 June following.

<p><a href="../cathen/11208a.htm">Right Rev. John Mary Odin</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06372a.htm">Galveston</a>, was appointed successor to Archbishop Blanc, and arrived in New Orleans on the Feat of Pentecost, 1861. The Civil War had already begun and excitement was intense. All the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and charity of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> were needed as the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> progressed. An earnest maintainer of discipline, <a href="../cathen/11208a.htm">Bishop Odin</a> found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, on 1 January, 1863, to issue regulations regarding the recklessness and carelessness that had prevailed in the temporal management of the churches the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">indebtedness</a> of which he had been compelled to assume to save them from <a href="../cathen/02252b.htm">bankruptcy</a>. The regulations were not favourably received, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, returning in the spring of 1863, when he had obtained the permission of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for his course of action. It was not until some time later that through his charity and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he obtained the cordial support he desired. His appeals for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> while in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> were not unheeded and early in 1863 forty seminarians and five <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> arrived with Bishop Dubuis of <a href="../cathen/06372a.htm">Galveston</a>. Among the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were Fathers Gustave A. Rouxel, later Auxiliary <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of New Orleans under Archbishop Chapelle, Thomas Heslin, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">Natchez</a>, and J. R. Bogaerts, vice-general under Archbishop Janssens. In 1860 the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Nuns from Cabra, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> came to New Orleans to take charge of St. John the Baptist School and open an academy. In 1864 the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> came to the city to assume charge of St. Alphonsus' School and Asylum and open a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a> were offered the Church of St. Michael at Convent, La. On 12 July, 1864, they assumed charge of Jefferson College founded by the state in 1835 and donated to them by Valcour Aime, a wealthy planter. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was incorporated on 15 August, 1866, the legal name being "The Roman Catholic Church of the Diocese of New Orleans". In 1867 during a terrible epidemic of yellow fever and cholera, Fathers Speesberger and <a href="../cathen/13681b.htm">Seelos</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a> died <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of charity. <a href="../cathen/13681b.htm">Father Seelos</a> was regarded as a saint and the cause of his beatification was introduced in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1905). In 1866, owing to financial trials throughout the South, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was closed. In February, 1868, <a href="../cathen/11208a.htm">Archbishop Odin</a> founded "The Morning Star" as the official organ of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which it has continued to be.

<p>During the nine years of <a href="../cathen/11208a.htm">Bishop Odin's</a> administration he nearly doubled the number of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and churches. He attended the Council of the Vatican, but was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the entry of the Garibaldian troops. His health was broken and he returned to his native home, Ambierle, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he died on 25 May, 1870. He was born on 25 February, 1801, and entered the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>. He came as a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> to their <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, The Barrens, in St. Louis, where he completed his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies and received <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> (see <a href="../cathen/06372a.htm">DIOCESE OF GALVESTON</a>). He was an excellent administrator and left his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> free from <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/11208a.htm">Archbishop Odin</a> was succeeded by Rev. Napoleon Joseph Perche, born at <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, January, 1805, and died on 27 December, 1883. The latter completed his studies at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Beaupr&eacute;, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> on 19 September, 1829, and sent to Murr near Angers where he worked <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a>. In 1837 he came to America with Bishop Flaget and was appointed <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a>. He came to New Orleans with Bishop Blanc in 1841, and he soon became famous in Louisiana for his eloquence and learning. <a href="../cathen/11208a.htm">Archbishop Odin</a> petitioned <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the appointment of Father Perche as his coadjutor with the right of succession. His request was granted and, on 1 May, 1870, Father Perche was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of New Orleans <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01030a.htm">Abdera</a>. He was promoted to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> on 26 May, 1970. One of his first acts was the re-establishment of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Nuns were received into the diocese in 1870.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07681a.htm">Congregation of the Immaculate Conception</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> sisterhood, was founded in the year 1873 by Father Cyprian Venissat, at Labadieville, to afford <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and assistance to children of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> impoverished by the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. In 1875 the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a> made a foundation, and on 21 November, 1877, the Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> Nuns of St. Louis sent two members to make a foundation in New Orleans, their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> being opened on 11 May, 1878. In 1878 the new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was organized and placed in charge of the Holy Cross Fathers from <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>. On 12 October, 1872, the Sisters of Perpetual Adoration opened their missions and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in New Orleans. In 1879 the Holy Cross Fathers opened a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in the lower portion of the city. Owing to the financial difficulties it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to close the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in 1881. Archbishop Perche was a great scholar, but he lacked administrative ability. In his desire to relieve Southern <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> ruined by the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, he gave to all largely and royally, and thus plunged the diocese into a <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> of over $600,000. He was growing very feeble and an application was made to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for a coadjutor.

<p>Bishop Francis Xavier Leray of <a href="../cathen/10710a.htm">Natchitoches</a> was transferred to New Orleans as coadjutor and Apostolic administrator of affairs on 23 October, 1879, and at once set to work to liquidate the immense <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>. It was during the administration of Archbishop Perche and the coadjutorship of Bishop Leray that the Board of Trustees of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> that formerly had caused so much trouble passed out of existence in July 1881, and transferred all the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to Archbishop Perche and Bishop Leray jointly, for the benefit and use of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population. Archbishop Leray was born at Ch&acirc;teau Giron, Brittany, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 20 April, 1825. He responded to the appeal for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Diocese of Louisiana</a> in 1843, and completed his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies in the Sulpician <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. He accompanied Bishop Chanche to Natchez and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by him on 19 March, 1852. He was a most active missionary in the Mississippi district and in 1860 when <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Vicksburg he brought the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> from <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> to establish a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> there. Several times during his years of activity as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> he was stricken with yellow fever.

<p>During the Civil War he served as a Confederate <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>; and on several occasions he was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> by the Federal forces but was released as soon as the sacred character of his office was established. On the death of Bishop Martin he was appointed to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of <a href="../cathen/10710a.htm">Natchitoches</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 22 April, 1877, at <a href="../cathen/12771b.htm">Rennes</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; on 23 October 1879 he was appointed coadjutor to Archbishop Perche of New Orleans and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Janopolis. His most difficult task was the bringing of financial order out of chaos and reducing the enormous <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In this he met with great success. During his administration the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> was reduced by at least $300,000. His health, however, became impaired, and he went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the hope of recuperating, and died at Ch&acirc;teau Giron, on 23 September, 1887.

<p>The see remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> for nearly a year, Very Rev. G. A.  Rouxel administering the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, until Right Rev. Francis Janssens, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">Natchez</a>, was promoted to fill the vacancy on 7 August, 1888, and took possession on 16 September, 1888. Archbishop Janssens was born at Tillbourg, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, on 17 October, 1843. At thirteen he began his studies in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/02625b.htm">Bois-le-Duc</a>; he remained there ten years, and in 1866 entered the American College at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> on 21 December, 1867, and arranged to come to America. He arrived at <a href="../cathen/13050a.htm">Richmond</a> in September, 1868, and became <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in 1870. He was administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> pending the appointment of Right Rev. James (later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>) Gibbons to the vacant see; Bishop Gibbons appointed him <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, and five years later when he was appointed to the Archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, Father Janssens became again administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. On 7 April, 1881, the <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">See of Natchez</a> became <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> by the promotion of Right Rev. William Elder as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> and Father Janssens succeeded. While <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10709b.htm">Natchez</a> he completed the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> commenced forty years before by Bishop Chanche. Not the least of the difficulties that awaited him as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of New Orleans was the heavy <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">indebtedness</a> resting upon the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and the constant drain thus made which had exhausted the treasury. There was no <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and the rapid growth of the population augmented the demand for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. He at once called a meeting of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and prominent citizens, and plans were formulated for the gradual liquidation of the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which was found to be $324,759. Before his death he had reduced it to about $130,000. Notwithstanding this burden, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, through the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Archbishop Janssens, entered upon a period of unusual activity. One of his first acts, March, 1890, was a to fund a little <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which was opened at Pounchatoula, La., 3 September, 1891, and placed under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Fathers</a>. He went to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in 1889 to secure <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the diocese and to arrange for the sale of bonds for the liquidation of the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>. In August, 1892, after the lynching of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> who assassinated the chief of police, the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart, founded in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> by Mother Cabrina for work among <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> immigrants, arrived in New Orleans and opened a large mission, a free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and an asylum for Italian <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, and began also mission work among the Italian gardeners on the outskirts of the city and in Kenner, La. The same year a terrific cyclone and storm swept the Louisiana Gulf Coast, and laid low the lands among the Caminada Cheniere where there was a settlement of Italian and Spanish and Malay fishermen. Out of a population of 1500 over 800 were swept away. Rev. Father Grimaud performed the burial service over 400 bodies as they were washed ashore. Father Bedel at Beras buried over three hundred and went out at night to succour the wandering and helpless. Archbishop Janssens in a small boat went among the lonely and desolate island settlements comforting the people and helping them to rebuild their broken homes.

<p>In 1893, the centenary of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was celebrated with splendor at the St. Louis Cathedral; Cardinal Gibbons and many of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> were present. Archbishop Janssens was instrumental, at this time, in establishing the Louisiana Leper's Home at Indian Camp, and it was through his officers that the Sisters of Charity at Emmitsburg took charge of the home. He was deeply interested in the work of the Coloured Sisters of the Holy Family, now domiciled in the ancient Quadroon Ball Room and Theatre of antebellum days, which had been turned into a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and boarding-school. Through the generosity of a coloured philanthropist, Thomy Lafon, Archbishop Janssens was enabled to provide a large and more comfortable home for the aged coloured poor, a new asylum for the boys, and through the legacy of $20,000 left for this purpose by Mr. Lafon, who died in 1883, a special home, under the care of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd, for the reform of coloured girls. The St. John Berchman's Chapel, a memorial to Thomy Lafon, was erected in the Convent of the Holy Family which he had so befriended. At this time Archbishop Janssens estimated the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the diocese at 341,613; the value of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> at $3,861,075; the number of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> a year 15,000 and the number of deaths, 5000.

<p>In 1896 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Winter School of America was organized and was formally opened by <a href="../cathen/13486a.htm">Cardinal Satolli</a>, then <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. After the death of Archbishop Janssens the lecture courses were abandoned. The active life led by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> told heavily upon him. Anxious to liquidate entirely the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> he made arrangements to visit <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in 1897, but died aboard the steamer Creole, 19 June, on the voyage to New York.

<p>Most Rev. Placide Louis Chapelle, D.D., <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Santa F&eacute;, was appointed to the vacant See of New Orleans, 1 December, 1897. Shortly after coming to New Orleans he found it imperative to go to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to effect a settlement for the remainder of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> of $130,000. While he was in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was declared between <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and, upon the declaration of peace, Archbishop Chapelle was appointed <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a> extraordinary to Cuba and Porto Rico and charge d'affaires to the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>. Returning from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> he arranged the assessment of five percent upon the salaries of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> for five years for the liquidation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>. In October 1900 he closed the little <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Ponchatoula, and opened a higher one in New Orleans, placing it in charge of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers. The Right Rev. G. A.  Rouxel was appointed <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a> for the See of New Orleans, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 10 April, 1899. Right Rev. J. M. Laval was made <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the St. Louis Cathedral on 21 April, and Very Rev. James H. Blenk was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12291b.htm">Porto Rico</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the St. Louis Cathedral with Archbishop Barnada of Santiago de Cuba, 2 July, 1899. Archbishop Chapelle was absent from the diocese for the greater part of his administration, <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> in the Antilles and the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> in connection with his position as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> claiming his attention, nevertheless he accomplished much for New Orleans. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> was extinguished, and the activity in church work which had begun under Archbishop Janssens continued; returning to New Orleans he introduced into the diocese the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers from the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>. In the summer of 1905, while the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was administering confirmation in the country <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, yellow fever broke out in New Orleans, and, deeming it his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to be among his people, he returned immediately to the city. On the way from the train to his residence he was stricken, and died 9 August, 1905 (see PLACIDE LOUIS CHAPELLE). Auxiliary Bishop Rouxel became the administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> pending the appointment of a successor. The Right Rev. James Herbert Blenk, S.M., D.D., <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12291b.htm">Porto Rico</a>, was promoted to New Orleans, 20 April, 1906.
<h2 id="section4">Contemporary conditions</h2>

<p>Archbishop Blenk was born at Neustadt, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, 28 July, 1856, of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> parentage. While a child, his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> came to New Orleans, and it was here that the light of the True Faith dawned upon the boy; he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in St. Alphonsus Church at the age of twelve. His primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> having been completed in New Orleans, he entered Jefferson College where he completed his classical and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> studies under the Marist fathers. He spent three years at the Marist house of studies in <a href="../cathen/02415a.htm">Belley</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, completed his probational studies at the Marist <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and was sent to Dublin to follow a higher course of mathematics at the Catholic University. Thence he went to St. Mary's College, Dundalk, County Louth, where he occupied the chair of mathematics. Later he returned to the Marist house of studies in Dublin where he completed his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies. 16 August, 1885, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and returned that year to Louisiana to labour among his own people. He was stationed as a professor at Jefferson College of which he became president in 1891 and held the position for six years. In 1896, at the invitation of the general of the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a>, he visited all the houses of the congregation in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and returning to New Orleans in February, 1897, he became <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Holy Name of Mary, <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a>, which was in charge of the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marist Fathers</a>. He erected the handsome presbytery and gave impetus to religion and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and city, being chairman of the Board of Studies of the newly organized Winter School. He was a member of the Board of Consultors during the administration of Archbishop Janssens and of Archbishop Chapelle; the latter selected him as the auditor and secretary of the Apostolic delegation to Cuba and Porto Rico. He was appointed the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12291b.htm">Island of Porto Rico</a> under the American occupation 12 June, 1890. A hurricane overswept Porto Rico just before Bishop Blenk left to take possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>; through his personal efforts he raised $30,000 in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> to take with him to alleviate the sufferings of his new people. The successful work of Bishop Blenk is part of the history of the reconstruction along American lines of the Antilles. He returned to New Orleans as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, 1 July, 1906, and new life was infused into every department of religious and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and charitable endeavour. Splendid new churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were erected, especially in the country <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. Among the new institutions were St. Joseph's Seminary and College at St. Benedict, La.; St. Charles College, Grand Coteau, built on the ruins of the old college destroyed by fire; Lake Charles Sanitarium; <a href="../cathen/15204b.htm">Marquette University</a>; and the Seaman's Haven, where a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was opened for sailors. The new sisterhoods admitted to the diocese were the Religious of the Incarnate Word in charge of a sanatorium at Lake Charles; the Religious of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, in charge of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in Broussardville; and the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Sisters driven from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, who erected a new Convent of St. Gertrude at St. Benedict, La., destined as an industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls. A large industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and farm for coloured boys under the direction of the Sisters of the Holy Family was opened in Gentilly Road, and two new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> outlined for the exclusive care of the coloured race. In 1907, the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> conducted by the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers was closed and Archbishop Blenk opened a preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and placed it in charge of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Fathers</a>. The diocese assumed full charge of the Chinchuba Deaf-Mute Institute, which was established under Archbishop Janssens and is the only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institute for deaf-mutes in the South. It is in charge of the School Sisters of Notre Dame.

<p>New Orleans' <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, like the population of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, is cosmopolitan. The training of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> has been conducted at home and abroad, the diocese owing much to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who come from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. Several efforts were made to establish a permanent <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and recruit the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> from the diocese itself. At various times also the diocese had students at St. Mary's and St. Charles Seminary, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, the American College, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and has (1910) twelve <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students in different <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and America. Each <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> is incorporated and there are corporate institutions of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities. The houses of study for religious are the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> scholasticate at Grand Coteau, and the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> scholasticate of St. Benedict at St. Benedict, La. The <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Nuns, Congregation of Marianites of the Holy Cross, <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline</a> Nuns, Religious of the Sacred Heart, <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, Sisters of Perpetual Adoration, Sisters of the Immaculate Conception, Sisters of the Holy Family (coloured), Sisters of Mount Carmel, have mother-houses with novitiates in New Orleans. In early days there were distinctive <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in New Orleans for French-, English- and German-speaking <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but with the growing diffusion of the English language these <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> lines have disappeared. In all the churches where <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, there are French, English, and German services and instructions; there are <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> for Italian immigrants and Hungarians, a German settlement at St. Leo near Rayne, domestic missions for <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> under the charge of the Holy Family Sisters and Josephite Fathers and <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> at New Orleans and Bayou Petite, Prairie.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> system is well organized. The principal institutions are: the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; the <a href="../cathen/15204b.htm">Marquette University</a> under the care of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; 7 colleges and academies with high school courses for boys with 1803 students; 17 academies for young ladies, under the direction of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, with 2201 students; 102 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> having an attendance of 20,000 pupils; 117 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a> with 1341 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>; 1 <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">infant asylum</a> with 164 infants; 1 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for whites with 90 inmates; 1 industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for coloured <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> boys; 1 deaf-mute asylum with 40 inmates; 3 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 2 homes for the aged white and 1 for the aged coloured poor; 1 house of the Good Shepherd for the reform of wayward girls; a Seaman's Haven. The state asylums for the blind, etc., <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>, reformatories, almshouses, and secular homes for incurables, consumptives, convalescents, etc., are all visited by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, conferences of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, and St. Margaret's Daughters. There is absolute freedom of worship. The first <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> conference was organized in 1852.

<p>The diocese has one <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> (St. Joseph's, of which Right Rev. Paul Sch&auml;uble is <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>); 156 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 123 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, making a total of 279 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; 133 churches with resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and 90 missions with churches, making a total of 223 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; 35 stations and 42 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> where Mass is said. The total <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is 550,000; yearly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> include 15,155 white children, 253 white adults, 3111 coloured children, and 354 coloured adults (total number of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> 18,873); the communions average 750,180; confirmations 11,215; converts, 817; <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, 3533 (including 323 mixed). The large centers of church activity are the cities of New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Plaquemine, Donaldsonville, Thibodeaux, Houma, Franklin, Jeannerette, New Iberia, Lafayette, Abeeville, Morgan City, St. Martin, Crowley, Lake Charles. The churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are all insured; an association for assisting infirm <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the Priest's Aid Society, has been established and mutual aid and benevolent associations in almost every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> for the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. Assimilation is constantly going on among the different nationalities that come to New Orleans through intermarriage between Germans, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, French, and Americans; and thus is created a healthy civil sentiment that conduces to earnest and harmonious progress along lines of religious, charitable, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a>, and social endeavour. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is naturally largely represented in the life and government of the community, the population being so overwhelmingly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> hold prominent civil positions such as governor, mayor, and member of the Bar, State Legislature, and <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Congress. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> from <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, Edward D. White, has been recently (1910) appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are connected with state normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and colleges, are on the board of the state <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> and public <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, and are represented in the corps of professors, patrons, and pupils of the Louisiana State and Tulane <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>. Three fourths of the teachers in the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of Louisiana are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> take a very active interest in the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Every church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> has its altar <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for the care of the tabernacle, sodalities of the Blessed Virgin for young girls and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The Holy Name Society for men, young and old, is established throughout the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, while conferences of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> are established in thirty churches. St. Margaret's Daughters, <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgenced</a> like <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, has twenty-eight circles at work, and the Total Abstinence Society is established in many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>. Besides the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis, the diocese has confraternities of the Happy Death, the Holy Face, the <a href="../cathen/13188b.htm">Holy Rosary</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07397c.htm">Holy Agony</a>; the <a href="../cathen/01633a.htm">Apostleship of Prayer</a> is established in nearly all the churches, while many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> have confraternities adapted to their special needs. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Knights of America and <a href="../cathen/08670c.htm">Knights of Columbus</a> are firmly established, while the Holy Spirit Society, devoted to the defence of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, the diffusion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the establishment of churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in wayside places, is doing noble work along church extension lines. Other <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> are the <a href="../cathen/09691a.htm">Marquette League</a>, the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, which traces its origin to Bishop DuBourg of Louisiana, the Society of the Holy Childhood, and the <a href="../cathen/12422b.htm">Priests' Eucharistic League</a>. Religious life in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is regular and characterized by strict discipline and earnest spirituality. Monthly conferences are held and ecclesiastical conferences three times a year.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: (1) Male: <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, Fathers and Brothers of the Holy Cross, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/08519b.htm">Josephites</a>, <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a>, <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13305a.htm">Brothers of the Sacred Heart</a>; (2) Female: Sisters of St. Benedict, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Sisters, Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> Nuns, Sisters of Mount Carmel, <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, Sisters of Charity, <a href="../cathen/07705a.htm">Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word</a>, <a href="../cathen/03711a.htm">Sisters of Christian Charity</a>, Sisters of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Sisters, Sisters of the Good Shepherd, Sisters of the Holy Family, Sisters of the Immaculate Conception, <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>, <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, Sisters Marianites of the Holy Cross, <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, School Sisters of Notre Dame, Sisters of Our Lady of Lourdes, Religious of the Sacred Heart, <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursuline Sisters</a>, Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart, Sisters of Perpetual Adoration of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. Coloured <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>: The works in behalf of the coloured race began in the earliest days of <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> devoted themselves especially to the care of the Indians and <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">Negroes</a>. After the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> ordered that a <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> for <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> be placed on every plantation. Although this was impossible owing to the scarcity of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the greatest interest was taken in the evangelization of <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> and winning them from <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> practices. The work of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> masters and mistresses bore fruit in many ways, and there remains today in New Orleans, despite the losses to the Faith occasioned by the Civil War and reconstruction period when hordes of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> missionaries from the north flocked into <a href="../cathen/09378a.htm">Louisiana</a> with millions of dollars to proselytize the race, a strong and sturdy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> element among the coloured people from which much is hoped. The Sisters of the Holy Family, a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> coloured order of religious, have accomplished much good. In addition to their academy and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> for girls and boys and homes for the coloured aged poor of both sexes, located in New Orleans, they have a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and conduct an academy in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a>, St. Louis, Mater Dolorosa, St. Dominic and St. Catherine in New Orleans, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and asylums in Madisonville, Donaldsonville, Opelusas, Baton Rouge, Mandevilles, Lafayette, and Palmetto, Louisiana. Schools for coloured children are also conducted by the following white <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders: Sisters of Perpetual Adoration, <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, Mount Carmel Sisters, Religious of the Sacred Heart, <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>. Six coloured <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in charge of lay <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers in various <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, St. Catherine's church in charge of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers, and St. Dominic's in charge of the Josephite Fathers in New Orleans are especially established for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a>.
