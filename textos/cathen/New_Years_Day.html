<div id="springfield2">
<h1>New Year's Day</h1>  

<p>The word <em>year</em> is etymologically the same as <em>hour</em> (Skeat), and signifies a going, movement etc. In <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a>, the word for "year" signifies repetition, sc. of the course of the sun (Gesenius). Since there was no <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> starting-point in the circle of the year, we find among different nations, and among the same at different epochs of their history, a great variety of dates with which the new year began. The opening of spring was a natural beginning, and in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> itself there is a close relationship between the beginning of the year and the seasons. The ancient Roman year began in March, but Julius Caesar, in correcting the calendar (46 B.C.), made January the first month. Though this custom has been universally adopted among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> nations, the names, September, October, November, and December (i.e., the seventh, eight, ninth, and tenth), remind us of the past, when March began the year. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writers and councils condemned the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> orgies and excesses connected with the festival of the <em>Saturnalia</em>, which were celebrated at the beginning of the year: <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> blames <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who regarded the customary presents &#151; called <em>strenae</em> (Fr. <em>&eacute;trennes</em>) from the goddess Strenia, who presided over New Year's Day (cf. Ovid, <em>Fasti</em>, 185-90) &#151; as mere tokens of friendly intercourse (De Idol. xiv), and towards the end of the sixth century the Council of Auxerre (can. I) forbade <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> <em>strenas diabolicas observare</em>. The II Council of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> held in 567 (can. 17) prescribes <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and a Mass of expiation for New Year's Day, adding that this is a practice long in use (<em>patres nostri statuerunt</em>). Dances were forbidden, and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> crimes were to be expiated by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> (St. Augustine, Serm., cxcvii-viii in P.L., XXXVIII, 1024; <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">Isidore of Seville</a>, <em>De Div. Off. Eccl.</em>, I, xli; <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Trullan Council</a>, 692, can. lxii). When <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> was fixed on 25 Dec., New Year's Day was sanctified by commemorating on it the <a href="../cathen/03779a.htm">Circumcision</a>, for which feast the Gelasian Sacramentary gives a Mass (<em>In Octabas Domini</em>). <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> did not wish to make the celebration of this feast very solemn, lest they might seem to countenance in any way the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> extravagance of the opening year.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> the first day of the seventh month, <em>Tishri</em> (end of September), began the civil or <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> year with the sound of trumpets (<a href="../bible/lev023.htm#vrs24">Leviticus 23:24</a>; <a href="../bible/num029.htm#vrs1">Numbers 29:1</a>). In the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> the day is not mentioned as New Year's Day, but the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> so regarded it, so named it, and so consider it now (Mishnah, Rosh Hash., I, 1). The sacred year began with Nisan (early in April), a later name for the Biblical <em>abhibh</em>, i.e. "month of new corn", and was memorable because in this month the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord thy God</a> brought thee out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> by night (<a href="../bible/deu016.htm#vrs1">Deuteronomy 16:1</a>). Barley ripens in Palestine during the early part of April; and thus the sacred year began with the harvest, the civil year with the sowing of the crops. From Biblical data <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> and many modern scholars hold that the twofold beginning of the year was pre-exilic, or even <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> (cf. <em>Antiq.</em>, I, iii, 3). Since Jewish months were regulated by the moon, while the ripening barley of Nisan depended upon the sun, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> resorted to intercalation to bring sun and moon dates into harmony, and to keep the months in the seasons to which they belonged (for method of adjustment, see Edersheim, <em>The Temple, Its Ministry and Services at the Time of Jesus Christ</em>, x).

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> nations did not agree in the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of New Year's Day. They were not opposed to 1 January as the beginning of the year, but rather to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> extravagances which accompanied it. Evidently the natural opening of the year, the springtime, together with the Jewish opening of the sacred year, Nisan, suggested the propriety of putting the beginning in that beautiful season. Also, the Dionysian method (so named from the Abbot Dionysius, sixth century) of dating events from the coming of Christ became an important factor in New Year calculations. The Annunciation, with which Dionysius began the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era, was fixed on 25 March, and became New Year's Day for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, in early times and from the thirteenth century to 1 Jan., 1752, when the present custom was introduced there. Some countries (e.g., <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>) began with <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, thus being almost in harmony with the ancient Germans, who made the winter solstice their starting-point. Notwithstanding the movable character of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the Low Countries took it as the first day of the year, while <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, up to the eighteenth century, made September the first month. The western nations, however, since the sixteenth, or, at the latest, the eighteenth century, have adopted and retained the first of January. In <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Christian liturgy</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not refer to the first of the year, any more than she does to the fact that the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> is the first day of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> year.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a> the great feast of the Epiphany has ceased to be a holyday of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, but New Year continues in force. Since the mysteries of the Epiphany are commemorated on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> &#151; the Orientals consider the fests one and the same in import &#151; it was thought advisable to retain by preference, under the title <em>Circumcision of Our Lord Jesus Christ</em>, New Year's Day as one of the six feast of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. The Fathers of the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> petitioned <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to this effect, and their petition was granted (Con. Plen. Balt., III, pp. 105 sqq.). (See <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">CHRONOLOGY</a>; <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">CHRISTMAS</a>.).
