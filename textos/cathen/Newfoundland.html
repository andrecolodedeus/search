<h1>Newfoundland</h1>  

<p>A British colony of North America (area 42,734 square miles), bounded on the north by the Strait of Belle Isle, which separates it from its dependency Labrador (area 120,000 square miles), on the east and south by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the west by the Gulf of St. Lawrence; lies between 46&#176; 35' and 51.0 40' lat. N., and 52&#176; 35' and 59&#176; 25' long. W.

<p>It was the first portion of North America discovered by <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> voyagers. The <a href="../cathen/03126d.htm">Cabots</a> sailed from <a href="../cathen/02790b.htm">Bristol</a> in 1497, and on 24 June of that year, the festival of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>, they landed in the harbour to which they gave the name of St. John's, which it bears to the present day. The <a href="../cathen/03126d.htm">Cabots</a>, like all the early navigators, had in view not only the discovery of new lands, and the increase of the power and wealth and territory of the mother country, but also the spread of the Gospel and the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>. Hence they brought with them <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and missionaries. Those who accompanied <a href="../cathen/03126d.htm">Cabot</a> were Augustinians or "Black Friars". We may be sure that <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated on these shores in 1497.

<p>In the year 1500 the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> under Gaspar de Cortereal took possession of the country and founded the settlement and Church of Placentia. In 1534 the French voyager, <a href="../cathen/03392b.htm">Jacques Cartier</a>, visited the country, and explored the Gulf of St. Lawrence. He also had <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> with him who celebrated <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> at Catalina in Newfoundland, and Brest, or Old Fort, on Labrador. In 1622 Lord Baltimore founded his colony of Ferryland. He brought out three <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> with him, and had Mass celebrated regularly, "and all other ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were used in ample manner as 'tis used in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>." Such was the complaint made against him to the Board of Trade by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, Mr. Stourton. In 1650 the French founded a church at Placentia on the site of the one abandoned by the Portuguese. But none of those attempts succeeded. The real foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Newfoundland is due to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, who came out towards the close of the eighteenth century.

<p>The population of the country by the last census, taken in 1901, was 217,037. Of these the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> number 75,657, members of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> 71,470, <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodists</a> 60,700. The reminder belong different <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterians</a>, <a href="../cathen/04239a.htm">Congregationalists</a>, etc.

<p>All <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> are equally recognized by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and there is no Established Church. In the early history of the country the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were looked on as a proscribed class by the governors of the time, who were generally commanders of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> war-ships. Priests were hunted and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, people who harboured them, or permitted Mass to be celebrated in their houses were fined, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, and flogged, and their houses either burned or pulled down. In one unique case a house where Mass had been celebrated was towed into the sea and sunk. These acts were undoubtedly illegal, as there was no law in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the country penalizing the exercise of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Religion, but the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> were supposed to be applicable to Newfoundland. However, the principle would not work both ways, and when Catholic Emancipation was granted to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> these same interpreters of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> held that the privileges of Emancipation did not apply to Newfoundland. During the whole course of his episcopate Bishop Fleming fought against, these injustices and finally succeeded in obtaining full freedom for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> matters <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> also enjoy every freedom. The denominational system is established by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. A sum is granted by Government amounting to about $1.13 <em>per caput</em> of the population, or $5.25 per pupil actually attending <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> this amount is small as compared with some of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> Provinces, or States of the Union, but a large amount is paid by private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> which is not included in the above figures. The results compare most favorably with those of other countries. About thirty years ago a branch of the <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Irish Christian Brothers</a> was introduced, an immediate impulse was given to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> throughout the island, and it. is now at, a very high standard. The Brothers have charge of two very large <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in St. John's--St. Patrick's and Holy Cross <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. There are ten class-rooms, containing about a thousand boys. The Brothers also have charge of the college in which some three hundred boys are <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, sixty being boarders. Here are trained the pupil-teachers who will have charge of the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> throughout the island. The college is affiliated to the Oxford Examining Board and the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> University Board. A local council of higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> (nondenominational) looks after the local Examinations. The Rhodes bequest gives three places for Newfoundland in perpetuity. They are all filled this year for the first time, and of the three occupants two are pupils of the College of St. Bonaventure. There are thirteen <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/12397a.htm">Sisters of the Presentation Order</a> in the country (9 in St. John's Diocese, 3 in <a href="../cathen/07133a.htm">Harbor Grace</a>, and 1 in <a href="../cathen/13351a.htm">St. George's</a>), and eight <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> (5 in St. John's, 2 in <a href="../cathen/07133a.htm">Harbor Grace</a>, and 1 in <a href="../cathen/13351a.htm">St. George's</a>). The <a href="../cathen/12397a.htm">Presentation Sisters</a> have free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> being paid out of the Government grant. The <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> have, besides free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, a paying <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and a boarding academy. The total number of children attending <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> is over 13,000. There are also two <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, or industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, one under the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> for girls, and one under the <a href="../cathen/03710b.htm">Christian Brothers</a> for boys. These contain about 200 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, or one for every 375 of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, which, considering that this is a maritime and fishing colony, and the losses at sea are abnormal, is not an excessive number.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion is not only holding its own, but advancing rapidly in Newfoundland. The most harmonious relations exist between the different <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>, which are only interrupted on occasions of public excitement, when <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> aspiring to political position and honours do not scruple to stir up feelings of religious bigotry and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> among the more simple-minded of the people. A great future is opening up for the country. Large industries are being started in the interior, the scene of the new developments being principally in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/07133a.htm">Harbor Grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/13351a.htm">St. George's</a>.
