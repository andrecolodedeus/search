<h1>Niccola Pisano</h1>  

<p>Architect and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> about 1205-07; d. there, 1278. He was the father of modern plastic art. When barely past adolescence, he came to the notice of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> of Swabia who took him to attend his <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, thence to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, to complete Castel Capuano and Castel dell'Uovo (1221-31). In 1233 Niccola was in Lucca; the <em>alto-rilievo</em> of the Deposition over the side door of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> may be of this date. The marble urn or <em>Arca</em> made to contain the body of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> in the church bearing his name in Bologna, is said to be an early work, but shows maturity; the charming group of the Madonna and Child upon it, foreshadows all the Madonnas of Italian art. From Niccola's designs was built the famous basilica of <a href="../cathen/01553d.htm">St. Anthony</a> in <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, the church of the Frari in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> is also attributed to him, possibly on insufficient grounds. In Florence he designed the interior of Sta. Trinit&agrave; which <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> so much that he called it his lady, "la mia Dama". Having been ordered by the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibellines</a> to destroy the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> frequented by the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a>, Niccola undermined the tower called <em>Guardo-morto</em>, causing it to so fall that it did not touch the precious edifice. On his return to <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, the architect erected the campanile for the church of S. Niccol&ograve; which contains the remarkable winding stair unsupported at its centre; an invention repeated by <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a> for the "Belvedere", and by <a href="../cathen/13443a.htm">San Gallo</a> in the renowned well at <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>. In 1242 Niccola superintended the building of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Pistoja, and in 1263 the restoration of S. Pietro Maggiore. He remodelled S. Domenico at <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a>, the Duomo at <a href="../cathen/15504b.htm">Volterra</a>, the Pieve and Sta. Margherita at <a href="../cathen/04401a.htm">Cortona</a>. Much of his work at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> is believed to have perished in the fire of 1610. A wonderful creation (1260) is the hexagonal, insulated <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a>. It is supported by seven columns, three of them resting on lions. The panels have reliefs from the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; the pediments, figures of virtues; the spandrels, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and evangelists. The <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> part is Italian Gothic: the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> are mainly pure reproductions of the antique. A second <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> for the Duomo of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> followed in 1266. Niccola's early <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> shows clumsiness, if we are to believe that the figures outside the Misericordia Vecchia in Florence are his. In later life, whether from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> or from his own Camposanto at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> (Roman sarcophagus used for the Countess Beatrice of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>; Greek vase with figures he reproduced) he learned to create with the freedom, beauty, and power of ancient art. Ruhmer suggests aptly that he may have used clay for his initial model, a method then unpractised in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. One of Niccola's last works in architecture was the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and church of La Scorgola, commemorating Charles of Anjou's victory at Tagliacozzo, now in ruins; in <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, the statuettes for the famous Fonte Maggiore at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, erected after his design (1277-80).
