<h1>Nicholas Coustou</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, 9 January, 1658; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1 May, 1733. He was the son of a wood-carver, from whom he received his first instruction in art. At the age of eighteen he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and studied under the tutorship of his uncle, the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> <a href="../cathen/04463c.htm">Coysevox</a>. On the occasion of <a href="../cathen/04096a.htm">Colbert's</a> last visit to the Royal Academy, Coustou received from his hands the gold medal for <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> (Colbert prize), which enabled him to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as a pensioner from 1683 to 1686. Here he applied himself especially to the study of <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a> and Algardi, hoping to unite in his own work the strength of the one and the grace of the other. On his return he settled in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and showed his independence by declining to submit to the decrees of the ruling <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>. The design made by him for a public monument being refused, he appealed directly to the king, who decided in his favour and awarded him the commission. Nicolas was joined by his younger brother Guillaume, also a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, whom he admitted to a share in his labours, so that it is not always easy to ascribe particular works definitely to one or the other. In 1720 Nicolas was appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the academy of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> and held his post until his death, shortly before which he was also made chancellor of the academy. <a href="../cathen/04463c.htm">Coysevox</a> and the Coustous formed a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> and were distinguished by grace, naturalness and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to life. Many of the works of Nicholas were destroyed in the fury of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, but a number still remain. Chief among them are the "Union of the Seine and Marne"; the "Huntsman Resting" (called in French "Berger Chasseur"); "Daphne Pursued by Apollo". All of these are now in the garden of the Tuileries; further, the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of Julius Caesar and Louis XV in the Louvre, and the "Descent From the Cross" in the choir of Notre-Dame, Paris, one of his best efforts. There are also <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> by Coustou at <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a> and Marly. A good terra-cotta bust of him by his brother Guillaume is in the Louvre.
