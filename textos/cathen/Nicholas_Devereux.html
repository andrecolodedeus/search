<h1>Nicholas Devereux</h1>  

<p>Born near Enniscorthy, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 7 June, 1791; died at <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a>, New York, 29 Dec., 1855, was the youngest brother of <a href="../cathen/16033a.htm">John C. Devereux</a>. Nicholas reached New York in 1806; on the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> following his arrival he attended Mass in St. Peter's, Barclay Street, and put on the plate one of his last three gold <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> blessed his generosity; when he died fifty years later he had amassed as a merchant half a million dollars. He purchased from the Holland Land Company four hundred thousand acres of land in Allegheny and Cattaraugus counties, New York, and started there an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> settlement. He gave largely towards the foundation of churches, colleges, and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>. He visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1854 accompanied by his wife, his daughter Mary, and Rev. Michael Clarke. He brought to America six <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Fathers and gave them $10,000 towards building a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Allegheny, N.Y., which has now become the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> college and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St. Bonaventure. On his return from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he wrote a letter to the New York "Freeman's Journal" offering to be one of one hundred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who would each give $1,000 towards founding a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of American <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. He had, moreover, several conversations with <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> who promised to use his influence with <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> to carry out the project. After his death his <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> carried out his wishes and thus was begun the foundation of the American College, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>Nicholas Devereux was a lover of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and read the entire <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> through seventeen times. To circulate the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> he had an edition of it printed at <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a> at his own expense. The plates of this edition were afterwards purchased by Messrs. Sadlier, of New York, and about 40,000 copies printed. He taught Sunday-school in St. John's Church, <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a>, and gave a copy of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> to any boy or girl who memorized the Gospel of St. John. In 1817 he married Mary D. Butler. His daughter Hannah married <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> Senator Francis Kernan; his daughter Mary became a <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sister of Mercy</a> and laboured for thirty years in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in Houston and 81st streets, New York. Nicholas Devereux was very charitable and hospitable &#151; a cultured, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, progressive <a href="../cathen/08132b.htm">Irish-American</a>. He was proud of his nationality and of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and this <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> was expressed in action whenever and wherever the opportunity arose. He was always glad to help the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, deeming it a privilege to give and thus to be the instrument used by Providence in establishing and building up our <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions. A noted instance of his spontaneous generosity refers back to the early days of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/04253b.htm">Connecticut</a>. Happening to be at <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford</a> one Sunday he learned that owing to the bigotry and <a href="../cathen/08677a.htm">Knownothing</a> sentiment in the town, it was impossible for the parishioners to obtain a certain piece of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> for their church, as they were too few and too poor to provide the ready cash demanded. Devereux, though a stranger, did not need to be appealed to, he immediately advanced the required sum of $10,000, without asking or receiving any assurance that the money would ever be returned to him, though the grateful pioneer <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> did in fact repay him later.
