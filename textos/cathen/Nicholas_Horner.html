<h1>Nicholas Horner</h1>  

<p>Layman and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, born at Grantley, Yorkshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; died at Smithfield, 4 March, 1590. He appears to have been following the calling of a tailor in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, when he was arrested on the charge of harbouring <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. He was confined for a long time in a damp and noisome cell, where he contracted blood poisoning in one leg, which it became <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to amputate. It is said that during this operation Horner was favoured with a vision, which acted as an anodyne to his sufferings. He was afterwards liberated, but when he was again found to be harbouring <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> he was convicted of felony, and as he refused to conform to the public worship of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> established, was condemned. On the eve of his <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">execution</a>, he had a vision of a crown of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> hanging over his head, which filled him with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to face the ordeal of the next day. The story of this vision was told by him to a friend, who in turn transmitted it by letter to <a href="../cathen/14164a.htm">Father Robert Southwell S.J.</a>, 18 March, 1590. Horner was hanged, drawn and quartered because he had relieved and assisted <a href="../cathen/02222a.htm">Christopher Bales</a>, <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, b. at Cunsley, <a href="../cathen/05211a.htm">Durham</a>, 1564, d. on the Scaffold at Fetter Lane, <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> 4 March, 1590. <a href="../cathen/02222a.htm">Father Bales</a> was cruelly tortured in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, although he was a consumptive; and was condemned merely for being a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.
