<h1>Nicholas Owen</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> lay-brother, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in 1606. There is no record of his parentage, birthplace, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth, or entrance into <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religion</a>. Probably a carpenter or builder by trade, he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> before 1580, and had previously been the trusty servant of the missionary fathers. <a href="../cathen/10564c.htm">More</a> (1586-1661) associates him with the first <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> lay-brothers. He was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> on the death of <a href="../cathen/05293c.htm">Edmund Campion</a> for openly declaring that <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> innocence, but afterwards served Fathers <a href="../cathen/06386b.htm">Henry Garnett</a> and <a href="../cathen/06466c.htm">John Gerard</a> for eighteen years, was captured again with the latter, escaped from the Tower, and is said to have contrived the escape of <a href="../cathen/06466c.htm">Father Gerard</a>. He was finally arrested at Hindlip Hall, Worcestershire, while impersonating <a href="../cathen/06386b.htm">Father Garnett</a>. "It is incredible", writes Cecil, "how great was the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> caused by his arrest . . . knowing the great skill of Owen in constructing hiding places, and the innumerable quantity of dark holes which he had schemed for hiding <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> all through <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>." Not only the Secretary of State but Waade, the Keeper of the Tower, appreciated the importance of the disclosures which Owen might be forced to make. After being committed to the Marshalsea and thence removed to the Tower, he was submitted to most terrible "examinations" on the Topcliffe rack, with both arms held fast in iron rings and body hanging, and later on with heavy weights attached to his feet, and at last died under torture. It was given out that he had committed <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> refuted by <a href="../cathen/06466c.htm">Father Gerard</a> in his narrative. As to the day of his death, a letter of <a href="../cathen/06386b.htm">Father Garnett's</a> shows that he was still alive on 3 March; the <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">"Menology"</a> of the province puts his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> as late as 12 Nov. He was of singularly innocent life and wonderful <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and his skill in devising hiding-places saved the lives of many of the missionary fathers.

<p>[<em>Note:</em> In 1970, Nicholas Owen was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Pope Paul VI among the Forty Martyrs of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, whose joint feast day is kept on 25 October.]
