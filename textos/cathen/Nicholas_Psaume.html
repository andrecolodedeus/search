<h1>Nicholas Psaume</h1>  

<p>(also PSAULME, PREAUME, <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> PSALM&AElig;US)

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, born at Chaumont-sur-Aire in 1518; died 10 August, 1575. Having studied classics at the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> Abbey of St. Paul at <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, of which his uncle Fran&ccedil;ois Psaume was <a href="../cathen/04155b.htm">commendatory abbot</a>, he completed a higher course of studies at the Universities of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, and Poitiers; and then entered the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> Abbey of St. Paul at <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1540, he was sent to the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, where, after a brilliant defence of numerous theses, he won his doctorate of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. But for the intrigues of Fran&ccedil;ois, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, Psaume, who had already been made <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Paul, <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>, would have been elected Abbot General of Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;, for his <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> had already been confirmed by <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I, King of France</a>. In 1546 he was chosen to represent the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> Order at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Lorraine retained him and, with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> consent, resigned the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a> in favour of Psaume, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> 26 August, 1548. In the following year he attended the <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and in the same year he published its canons and decrees in his own diocese. He was also present at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">General Council of Trent</a> from May, 1551, until its prorogation on 28 April, 1552, distinguishing himself by his eloquence and learning and by his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in defence of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and the prerogatives of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He was active in condemning certain abuses, especially those of the <em>commenda</em> (see <a href="../cathen/04155b.htm">COMMENDATORY ABBOT</a>). On 2 January, 1552, he was charged by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> with the editing of the canons of the council. In 1562 he returned to <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, where the sessions of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">council</a> had been resumed. On both occasions Psaume kept a diary of all that passed at the various sessions; it was printed at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1564-80), at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> and at <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a> in the same year. Hugo, the <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalist</a> of the order, also edited it in two parts, but much was left out in the second part. Hugo's "Collectio" was edited by Le Plat in the fifth volume of his "Monumenta Conc. Tridentin." The parts omitted are supplied by <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, "Ungedruckte Berichte u. Tageb&uuml;cher z. Geschichte d. Konzils v. Trient", II (Nordlingen, 1876), p. 172. Psaume was also requested by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> and <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> to co-ordinate French <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation and make it agree with the canons and decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. He wrote much in defence of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. To provide a sound <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for youth he gave financial assistance to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in founding a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>. He is buried near the altar of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a>.
