<h1>Nicholas Riccardi</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, writer and preacher; born at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, 1585; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 30 May, 1639. Physically he was unprepossessing, even slightly deformed. His physical deficiencies, however, were abundantly compensated for by mentality of the highest order. His natural taste for study was encouraged by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> who sent him to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to pursue his studies in the Pincian Academy. While a student at this institution he entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican order</a> and was invested with its habit in the Convent of St. Paul, where he studied <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. So brilliant was his record that after completing his studies he was made a professor of <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at Pincia. While discharging his academic <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, he acquired a reputation as a preacher second only to his fame as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>. As a preacher Philip III of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> named him "The Marvel", a sobriquet by which he was known in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> till the end of his life. On his removal to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1621, he acquired the confidence of <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>. He was made regent of studies and professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the College of the Minerva. In 1629 <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/10039a.htm">Master of the Sacred Palace</a> to succeed Niccol&ograve; Ridolphi, recently elected Master General of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. Shortly after this the same pontiff appointed him pontifical preacher. These two offices he discharged with distinction. His extant works number twenty. Besides several volumes of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> for <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>, <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, and special occasions, his writings treat of Scripture, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and history. One of his best known works is the "History of the Council of Trent" (Rome, 1627). His commentaries treat of all the books of Scripture, and are notable for their originality, clearness, and profound learning. Two other commentaries treat of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> and the Canticle of Canticles.
