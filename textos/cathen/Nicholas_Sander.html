<h1>Nicholas Sander</h1>  

<p>(SANDERS).

<p>Born at Charlwood, Surrey, in 1530; died in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1581. <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> and New College, <a href="../cathen/11365b.htm">Oxford</a>, he graduated in 1551, and took a share in <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole's</a> reform of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. He had to flee under Elizabeth and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, afterwards receiving the degree of Doctor of Divinity. He also wrote there in 1560 a remarkable "Report on the State of England" for Cardinal Moroni (Catholic Record Soc., I). He attended the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> of <a href="../cathen/07473a.htm">Cardinal Hosius</a> and afterwards accompanied him and <a href="../cathen/03223a.htm">Cardinal Commendone</a> in legations to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and Lithuania. In 1565 he returned to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, then much frequented by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> exiles, amongst whom was his mother, his sister Elizabeth being a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> of <a href="../cathen/14394b.htm">Syon</a> at <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>. Nicholas became professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> there, and soon joined in the great controversy over Jewel's "Apologie", in which the English exiles first appeared to the world as a learned and united <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body. Sander's contributions were, "The Supper of the Lord", "A Treatise of Images", "The Rock of the Church" (Louvain, 1565, 1566, 1567), followed by his great work, "De visibili monarchia ecclesiae" (Louvain 1571). These works, joined with the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> he had already given of diplomatic ability, and the high esteem of the nobles and gentry who had fled from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> after the Northern Rising (1569), caused Sander to be regarded as practically the chief English <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> leader. Almost the earliest attempt to restore <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> after the fall of the ancient <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was the <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">Rescript</a> of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> (14 August, 1567), granting to Sander, Thomas Harding, and Thomas Peacock (the former treasurer of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a> and president of Queen's College, Cambridge; see "Dict. Nat. Biog.", xxiv, 339; xliv, 143) "bishoply power in the court of conscience", to receive back those who had lapsed into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> (Vatican Arch., Var. Pol, lxvi, 258; Arm., 64, xxviii, 60). When Sander was summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1572, his friends believed that he would be made a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> died before he arrived. <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> kept him as consultor on English matters, and many letters of this period are still preserved in the Vatican. In 1573 he went to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to urge Philip II to subsidize the exiles, and when in 1578 James Fitzgerald had persuaded Sega, <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, with the warm <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory</a>, and the cold connivance of Philip, to fit out a ship to carry arms to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, Sanders went with him as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> agent, but without any title or office. They landed in Dingle Bay (17 July, 1579) and the Second Desmond <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> ensued with its terrible consequences. Sander bore up with unshaken <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, as his letters and proclamations show, in spite of all disasters, till his death. He belonged to the first group of English exiles, who, never having lived in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, never realized how complete Elizabeth's victory was. He believed, and acted consistently in the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, that strong measures, like <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> were the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> remedies for the great evils of the time; a mistaken policy, which though supported by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of that day, was subsequently changed. The most widely known of Sander's books is his short "De schismate Anglicano". It was published after his death, first by <a href="../cathen/13063c.htm">E. Rishton</a> at Cologne in 1585, then with many additions by <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Father Persons</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1586. Translated into various languages and frequently reprinted, it was fiercely controverted especially by Bishop Burnet, but defended by Joachim Le Grand. It is now acknowledged to be an excellent, popular account of the period from a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> point of view.
