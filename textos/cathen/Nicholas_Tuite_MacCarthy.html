<h1>Nicholas Tuite MacCarthy</h1>  

<p>Called the Abb&eacute; de L&eacute;vignac, born in Dublin on 19 May, 1769; died at Ann&eacute;cy, <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, 3 May, 1833. He was the second son of Count Justin MacCarthy, by Mary Winefrid Tuite, daughter of Nicholas Tuite, Chamberlain to the King of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. At the age of four he was taken by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, where, disgusted with English law as administered in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, they took up their permanent abode. Later he was sent to the Coll&eacute;ge du Plessis in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. At the age of fourteen he received <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of St-Magloire. He had nearly completed his course of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a> when the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> forced him to leave. He retired to <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. His <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> was postponed until his forty-fifth year (1814), partly owing to the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, and partly to a weakness of the loins which rendered it impossible for him to stand for any considerable time. Having sufficiently recovered from this infirmity, he entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/03566c.htm">Chamb&eacute;ry</a>, in <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, in 1813, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in June, 1814. <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> was the scene of his first missionary labours. In a short time he became a famous preacher. In 1817 he was offered the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a>, which he refused. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in 1818, and made his simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> two years later. He was reserved exclusively for preaching. So noted was his talent in this respect that he was appointed during his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> to preach the <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> Station before the Court of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The fame of his preaching spread throughout the kingdom, and accordingly he was invited to preach in all the principal cities of the country, as well as in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. He was admitted to the solemn profession of the order in 1828. The Revolution of 1830 led him to retire to <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, whence he was summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, arriving in October of the same year. While in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he preached every <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> before the most distinguished personages there. After a short time, however, his health, never robust, became greatly impaired; but not even this lessened his spiritual <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. On leaving <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he settled in <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, at a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of his order. At the request of the King of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>--whose brother Charles Emmanuel was a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>--the Abb&eacute; MacCarthy conducted a retreat for the Brigade of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, and did much good amongst the military, his time being completely devoted to the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> and confessional. He preached the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> course of sermons at Ann&eacute;cy, but being soon afterwards taken ill, expired there, in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> palace, and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. As a preacher, he was in eloquence inferior only to such men as <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> and <a href="../cathen/10034a.htm">Massillon</a>; but whilst they spoke principally for a special class of hearers, the Abb&eacute; MacCarthy's sermons are for all countries and for all time, and are to be regarded even at the present day, for depth of thought, for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and for practical application, as among the best contributions to homiletic literature.
