<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Nicholas of Cusa</h1>  

<p>German <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and administrator, b. at Cues on the Moselle, in the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, 1400 or 1401; d. at <a href="../cathen/14754a.htm">Todi</a>, in Umbria, 11 August, 1464. His father, Johann Cryfts (Krebs), a wealthy boatman (<em>nauta,</em> not a "poor fisherman"), died in 1450 or 1451, and his mother, Catharina Roemers, in 1427. The legend that Nicholas fled from the ill-treatment of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> to Count Ulrich of Mandersheid is doubtfully reported by Hartzheim (Vita N. de Cusa, Trier, 1730), and has never been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. Of his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Deventer nothing is known; but in 1416 he was matriculated in the <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">University of Heidelberg</a>, by Rector Nicholas of Bettenberg, as "Nicholaus Cancer de Coesze, cler[icus] Trever[ensis] dioc[esis]". A year later, 1417, he left for Padua, where he graduated, in 1423, as doctor in canon law (<em>decretorum doctor</em>) under the celebrated Giuliano Cesarini. It is said that in later years, he was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with the doctorate in <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02641b.htm">University of Bologna</a>. At Padua he became the friend of <a href="../cathen/14786a.htm">Paolo Toscanelli</a>, afterwards a celebrated physician and scientist. He studied Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and, in later years, Arabic, though, as his friend Johannes Andre&aelig;, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Aleria, testifies, and as appears from the style of his writings, he was not a lover of rhetoric and poetry. That the loss of a lawsuit at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> should have decided his choice of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> state, is not supported by his previous career. Aided by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, he matriculated in the <a href="../cathen/04120a.htm">University of Cologne</a>, for divinity, under the rectorship of Petrus von Weiler, in 1425. His identity with the "Nicolaus Trevirensis", who is mentioned as secretary to Cardinal Orsini, and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 1426, is not certain. After 1428, <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> at Coblenz, Oberwesel, M&uuml;nstermaifeld, Dypurgh, St. Wendel, and Li&#232;ge fell to his lot, successively or simultaneously.

<p>His public career began in 1421, at the Council of Basle, which opened under the presidency of his former teacher, Giuliano Cesarini. The cause of Count Ulrich of Manderscheid, which he defended, was lost and the transactions with the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>, in which the represented the German nation, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> fruitless. His main efforts at the council were for the reform of the calendar and for the unity, political and religious, of all <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. In 1437 the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> minority sent him to <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>, whom he strongly supported. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> entrusted him with a mission to Constantinople, where, in the course of two months, besides discovering Greek <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> and <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John Damascene</a>, he gained over for the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, the emperor, the patriarch, and twenty-eight <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. After reporting the result of his missions to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, in 1438, he was created <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to support the cause of <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>. He did so before the Diets of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (1441), Frankfort (1442), <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> (1444), again of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> (1446), and even at the court of Charles VII of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, with such force that &#198;neas Sylvius called him the Hercules of the Eugenians. As a reward <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> nominated him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>; but Nicholas declined the dignity. It needed a command of the next <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, to bring him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the acceptance of this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. In 1449 he was proclaimed <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a> of the title of St. Peter ad Vincula.

<p>His new dignity was fraught with labours and crosses. The <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Diocese of Brixen</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of which was vacant, needed a reformer. The Cardinal of Cusa was appointed (1450), but, owing to the opposition of the chapter and of Sigmund, Duke of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and Count of the Tyrol, could not take possession of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> until two years later. In the meantime the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> was sent by <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, to Northern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>. He was to preach the Jubilee <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> and to promote the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>; to visit, reform, and correct <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>; to endeavour to reunite the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; to end the dissensions between the Duke of Cleve and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>; and to treat with the Duke of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> with a view to peace between <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He crossed the Brenner in January, 1451, held a provincial synod at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, visited <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, held a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod at <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, presided over the provincial chapter of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, and reformed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the Dioceses of Erfurt, <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>, <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10323a.htm">Minden</a>. Through the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> he was accompanied by his friend Denys the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a>. In 1452 he concluded his visitations by holding a provincial synod at Cologne. Everywhere, according to <a href="../cathen/15062a.htm">Abbot Trithemius</a>, he had appeared as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light and peace, but it was not to be so in his own diocese. The troubles began with the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a> of <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Sonnenburg, who needed reformation, but were shielded by Duke Sigmund. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> had to take refuge in the stronghold of Andraz, at Buchenstein, and finally, by special authority received from <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, pronounced an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> upon the Countship of the Tyrol. In 1460 the duke made him <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> at Burneck and extorted from him a treaty unfavourable to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. Nicholas fled to <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pope Pius II</a>, who <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the duke and laid an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, to be enforced by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>. But the duke, himself an immoral man, and, further, instigated by the antipapal <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a> Heimburg, defied the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and appealed to a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. It needed the strong influence of the emperor, Frederick III, to make him finally (1464) submit to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This took place some days after the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> death. The account of the twelve years' struggle given by J&#228;ger and, after him, by Prantl, is unfair to the "foreign reformer" (see Pastor, op. cit. infra, II). The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, who had accompanied <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> fleet at <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, was sent by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to Leghorn to hasten the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>, but on the way succumbed to an illness, the result of his ill-treatment at the hands of Sigmund, from which he had never fully recovered. He died at <a href="../cathen/14754a.htm">Todi</a>, in the presence of his friends, the physician <a href="../cathen/14786a.htm">Toscanelli</a> and Bishop Johannes Andre&aelig;.

<p>The body of Nicholas of Cusa rests in his own titular church in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, beneath an effigy of him sculptured in relief, but his heart is deposited before the altar in the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of Cues. This <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> was the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> own foundation. By mutual agreement with his sister Clare and his brother John, his entire inheritance was made the basis of the foundation, and by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> last will his altar service, <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> instruments were bequeathed to it. The extensive buildings with <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, and refectory, which were erected in 1451-56, stand to this day, and serve their original purpose of a home for thirty-three old men, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the thirty-three years of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> earthly life. Another foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> was a residence at Deventer, called the <em>Bursa Cusana,</em> where twenty poor <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> students were to be supported. Among bequests, a sum of 260 ducats was left to S. Maria dell' Anima in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, for an infirmary. In the archives of this institution is found the original document of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> last will.

<p>The writings of Cardinal Nicholas may be classified under four heads: (1) juridical writings: "De concordantia catholica" and "De auctoritate pr&aelig;sidendi in concilio generali" (1432-35), both written on occasion of the Council of Basle. The superiority of the <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a> over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is maintained; though, when the majority of the assembly drew from these writings startling conclusions unfavourable to <a href="../cathen/05598a.htm">Pope Eugene</a>, the author seems to have changed his views, as appears from his action after 1437. The political reforms proposed were skilfully utilized by G&ouml;rres in 1814. (2) In his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> writings, composed after 1439, he set aside the definition and methods of the "Aristotelean Sect" and replaced them by deep speculations and mystical forms of his own. The best known is his first treatise, "De docta ignorantia" (1439- 40), on the finite and the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. The Theory of Knowledge is critically examined in the treatise "De conjecturis" (1440-44) and especially in the "Compendium" (1464). In his Cosmology he calls the Creator the <em>Possest (posse-est,</em> the possible- actual), alluding to the argument: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is possible, therefore actual. His <em>microcosmos</em> in created things has some similarity with the "monads" and the "emanation" of Leibniz. (3) The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> treatises are dogmatic, ascetic, and mystic. "De cribratione alchorani" (1460) was occasioned by his visit to Constantinople, and was written for the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were written: "De qu&aelig;rendo Deum" (1445), "De filiatione Dei" (1445), "De visione Dei" (1453), "Excitationum libri X" (1431-64), and others. The favourite subject of his mystical speculations was the Trinity. His concept of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has been much disputed, and has even been called <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a>. The context of his writings proves, however, that they are all strictly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. Scharpff calls his <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> a <a href="../cathen/14661a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Kempis</a> in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> language. (4) The scientific writings consist of a dozen treatises, mostly short, of which the "Reparatio Calendarii" (1436), with a correction of the Alphonsine Tables, is the most important. (For an account of its contents and its results, see <a href="../cathen/09247c.htm">L<font size=-2>ILIUS,</font> A<font size=-2>LOISIUS</font></a>.) The shorter mathematical treatises are examined in K&#228;stner's "History of Mathematics", II. Among them is a claim for the exact quadrature of the circle, which was refuted by Regiomontanus [see <a href="../cathen/10628a.htm">M<font size=-2>&#220;LLER</font> (R<font size=-2>EGIOMONTANUS</font>), J<font size=-2>OHANN </font></a>]. The <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> views of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> are scattered through his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> treatises. They evince complete independence of traditional doctrines, though they are based on symbolism of numbers, on combinations of letters, and on abstract speculations rather than observation. The earth is a star like other stars, is not the centre of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, is not at rest, nor are its poles fixed. The celestial bodies are not strictly spherical, nor are their orbits circular. The difference between theory and appearance is explained by relative motion. Had <a href="../cathen/04352b.htm">Copernicus</a> been aware of these assertions he would probably have been encouraged by them to publish his own monumental work. The collected editions of Nicholas of Cusa's works are: <em>Incunabula</em> (before 1476) in 2 vols., incomplete; <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1514) in 3 vols.; Basle (1565), in 3 vols.
