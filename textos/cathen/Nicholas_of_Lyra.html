<h1>Nicholas of Lyra</h1>  

<p>(<em>Doctor planus et utilis</em>)

<p>Exegete, b. at Lyra in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, 1270; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1340. The report that he was of Jewish descent dates only from the fifteenth century. He took the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> habit at Verneuil, studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, received the doctor's degree in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and was appointed professor at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>. In the famous controversy on the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">Beatific Vision</a> he took sides with the professors against <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>. He labored very successfully, both in preaching and writing, for the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. He is the author of numerous <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works, some of which are yet unpublished. It was to <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> that Nicholas of Lyra devoted his best years. In the second prologue to his monumental work, "Postillae perpetuae in universam S. Scripturam", after stating that the literal sense of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> is the foundation of all mystical expositions, and that it alone has demonstrative force, as <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> teaches, he deplores the state of Biblical studies in his time. The literal sense, he avers, is much obscured, owing partly to the carelessness of the copyists, partly to the unskillfulness of some of the correctors, and partly also to our own translation (the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>), which not infrequently departs from the original Hebrew. He holds with <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> that the text must be corrected from the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a>, except of course the prophecies concerning the Divinity of Christ. Another reason for this obscurity, Nicholas goes on to say, is the attachment of scholars to the method of interpretation handed down by others who, though they have said many things well, have yet touched but sparingly on the literal sense, and have so multiplied the mystical senses as nearly to intercept and choke it. Moreover, the text has been distorted by a multiplicity of arbitrary divisions and concordances. Hereupon he declares his intention of insisting, in the present work, upon the literal sense and of interspersing only a few mystical interpretations. Nicholas utilized all available sources, fully mastered the Hebrew and drew copiously from the valuable commentaries of the Jewish <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetes</a>, especially of the celebrated Talmudist Rashi. The "Pugio Fidei" of Raymond Martini and the commentaries of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> were laid under contribution. His exposition is lucid and concise; his observations are judicious and sound, and always original. The "Postillae" soon became the favourite manual of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>. It was the first Biblical commentary printed. The solid learning of Nicholas commanded the respect of both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> owes much to Nicholas of Lyra, but how widely the principles of Nicholas differed essentially from <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> views is best seen from Nicholas's own words. "I protest that I do not intend to assert or determine anything that has not been manifestly determined by <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> or by the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> . . . . Wherefore I submit all I have said or shall say to the correction of Holy Mother Church and of all learned men . . . "(Prol. secund. in Postillas., ed. 1498). Nicholas taught no new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. The early Fathers and the great <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">schoolmen</a> had repeatedly laid down the same sound <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> principles, but, owing to adverse tendencies of the times, their efforts had partly failed. Nicholas carried out these principles effectively, and in this lies his chief merit &mdash; one which ranks him among the foremost <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetes</a> of all times.
