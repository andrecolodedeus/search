<h1>Nicola Spedalieri</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, born at Bronte in the Province of Catania, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, 6 December, 1740; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 26 November, 1795. He studied in the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/10508a.htm">Monreale</a>, then the most flourishing in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and mathematics, and later of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. At the same time he cultivated the arts of poetry, music, and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. Disgusted at the opposition stirred up by certain <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> theses, which were branded as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> at Palermo but approved at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he withdrew from <a href="../cathen/10508a.htm">Monreale</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1773 or 1774), where for ten years he led a life of penury but of fruitful study and labour. However, he always retained his affection for the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/10508a.htm">Monreale</a>. In 1784 he obtained from <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Vatican Basilica</a>, and then ceased the efforts he had made for years to obtain a chair in the Universities of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>. His first published work was "Analisi dell' Esame critico di Fr&eacute;ret" ("Examen critique des apologies de la religion chr&eacute;tienne", a work wrongly attributed to Fr&eacute;ret, really written by Naigeon), Rome, 1778. In 1779 he published "Ragionamento sopra l'arte di governare" and "Ragionamento sull' influenza della religione cristiana sulla societ&agrave; civile". In 1784 he issued, also at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, his "Confutazione di Gibbon" in which he combats the thesis of the English historian who blames <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> for the downfall of the Roman Empire. In it, as in the Apology against Fr&eacute;ret, he shows especially the benefits conferred by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> on the social and political order, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is the most powerful bulwark against despotism.

<p>In 1791 appeared his principal work "I diritti dell' uomo", also at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; this was evidently intended as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> answer to the proclamation of the "Rights of Man", made in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1789, which was the signal for the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. Notwithstanding the hearty reception given to this work by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> who said, "For a long while rulers have been asking <em>quid est papa</em>. Your book will teach them <em>quid est populus</em>", a storm of criticism and refutation burst on the head of its author. Governments took notice of it and (e.g. <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>) forbade its circulation. The controversy continued even after Spedalieri's death. In his book, except in certain details, the writer only expressed in the language of the eighteenth century the teaching of the scholastic <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> on the popular origin of political sovereignty, a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> commonly taught from <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> to Francisco Su&aacute;rez and <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, which does not exclude the Divine origin of the same sovereignty. Spedalieri's thesis could not prove acceptable to the absolutism of princes and the <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesian</a> doctrines then in vogue, which did not admit the existence of a natural moral law but made all depend on the arbitrary Will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; much less could it please the regalists. On the other hand, it is easy to understand how his theory might give rise to a fear that it was too favourable to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the revolutionaries. Spedalieri was wrongly claimed by the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> as one of theirs, and if some of them accuse him of a want of loyalty when he wishes to conciliate democracy and a Divine sanction of the social order, it is because they do not understand the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature of democracy or of the saying that all authority comes from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The controversies about Spedalieri were renewed on the occasion of the centenary of his death. Shortly before his decease he completed a "Storia delle Paludi Pontine", a book <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> ordered him to write and which was published by his intimate friend Nicolai, in the work "De bonificamenti delle terre pontine" (Rome, 1800). His death was attributed to poison; a modern writer has not hesitated to lay the blame on the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, forgetting that Spedalieri's enemies were the bitterest adversaries of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>.
