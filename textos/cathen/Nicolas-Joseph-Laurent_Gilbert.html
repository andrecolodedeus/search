<h1>Nicolas-Joseph-Laurent Gilbert</h1>  

<p>Poet, b. at Fontenoy-le-Ch&acirc;teau, 1751; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 12 November, 1780. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were poor farmers. He pursued his studies at the Coll&egrave;ge de l'Arc at D&ocirc;le, where the professor of literature boasted of having made poets of all his pupils except Gilbert. Upon leaving college in 1769, he settled at <a href="../cathen/10680a.htm">Nancy</a> and tried to open a public course in literature. In 1772 he competed unsuccessfully for a prize at the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a>. In 1774 he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where Freron won for him the favour of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Young and unknown, he had the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to oppose the triumphant and all-powerful chiefs of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> party. Although there is a little juvenile audacity in the fury of his attacks, the sincerity of his religious convictions cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>. He died of brain fever caused by a fall from his horse. His enemies reported that he died insane; his partisans claimed that he died in misery at the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. Neither report is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. After the accident which caused his death, he was taken to the Hotel-Dieu, but was soon removed to his own house, where he died. The story of his poverty is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, for at the time of his death he was drawing three pensions, which constituted for that time a rather large income. Gilbert's works consist of a <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a> novel, "Les families de Darius et d'Eridame" (Paris, 1770), a satire in prose, "Le carnaval des auteurs" (Paris, 1773), a few odes, and satires. Three pieces, one ode and two satires, have given him a lasting reputation: the "Ode imit&eacute;e de plusieurs psaumes" (1788), usually known under the title of "Adieux &agrave; la vie", struck the first personal and melancholy notes which were the characteristic of the Romantic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; in the satires "Le dix-huiti&egrave;me si&egrave;cle" (1775) and "Mon apologie" (1778) there is a force, movement, and eloquence which one does not find elsewhere in the poetry of that time. He vigorously opposes the manners of the time and castigates the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and the Academy. His words are those of a man who writes with freedom, emotion, and sincerity, though his style is not always equal to the thought.
