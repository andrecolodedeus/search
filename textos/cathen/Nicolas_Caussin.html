<h1>Nicolas Caussin</h1>  

<p>A famous <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> preacher and moralist; b. at <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1583; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 2 July, 1651. His father, a physician of extensive practice, was able from a competent income to aid materially in the development of the remarkable talents that his son early displayed. Young Caussin's success in oratory, particularly after his entry into the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> (1609), was brilliant, and drew to him the attention of the royal family. When the kingdom of Henry IV was fast declining under the impotent sway of the queen-regent, Marie de' Medici, Louis XIII came to the throne. <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> summoned Caussin to court to direct the young king's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. The task was a difficult one in those disturbed times, but Caussin, with scrupulous earnestness, gave his heart and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the work. The king, who relied implicitly on him, was made to realize that peace would once more reign in his realm and in his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> when he recalled the queen-mother and other members of the royal family from the banishment in which they were languishing. <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> disliked this advice and accused Caussin of raising <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> scruples in the king's mind, and even of holding communications that savoured of treachery or that were at all events disloyal to his sovereign, with another of the royal <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>. Caussin was at once banished to Quimper-Corentin in Brittany, where he remained until the death of <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a> in 1643, when he returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to prepare his works for the press.

<p>Many <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> statement regarding Caussin's disgrace were current. The <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> Arnauld claims that "it was well known from <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> intimately connected at the former court of Louis XIII, that Father Caussin considered himself <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to tell His Majesty that attrition, arising from the fear of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> alone, was not sufficient for justification, as there could be no justification without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this was what caused his disgrace." Many more surmises were engaged in by other <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, but the reason given above is admitted by unfriendly biographers of the father. Among his works are: "La Cour Sainte" (5 vols.)--"A comprehensive system of moral maxims, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> reflections and historical examples, forming in itself a complete <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of rational entertainment, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> devotion, and Christian <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." It was translated into several languages and has done much to perpetuate his fame. The English translation was printed in Dublin in 1815. "Le parall&egrave;le de l'&eacute;loquence sacree et profane"; "La vie de Sante Isabelle de France, soeur du roi St. Louis"; "Vie du Cardinal du Richelieu"; "Thesaurus Gr&aelig;c&aelig; Poeseos." For his other works see <a href="../cathen/02190c.htm">De Backer</a>, "Bibl. des &eacute;criv. de la c. de J." (Li&egrave;ge, 1855), and Sommervogel (new ed., <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>), II Feller, Biog. Univ. (Paris 1834); Duhr, Jesuiten Fabelen (4th ed., 1904), 670 sqq.; Cherot in Dict. de th&eacute;ol. cath., s.v.
