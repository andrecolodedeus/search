<h1>Nicolas Coeffeteau</h1>  

<p>Preacher and controversialist, born 1574, at Ch&acirc;teau-du-Loir, province of Maine, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; died <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 21 April, 1623. Ha entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, 1588, and after his profession, 1590, was sent to St-Jacques, the house of studies at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. There in 1595 he began to teach <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. On 4 May, 1600, he received the doctorate and was appointed regent of studies, which position he filled until 1606 and again from 1609 to the spring of 1612. He also served two terms as prior and was <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the French congregation from 1606 to 1609. At this time Coeffeteau had already acquired distinction by his preaching at <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a>, <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Queen Margaret of Valois had made him her almoner in 1602, and in 1608 he received the appointment of preacher in ordinary to King Henry IV. In June, 1617, he was proposed by Louis XIII and confirmed by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Pope Paul V</a> as <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dardania and Administrator of the Diocese of Mets. By his vigilance and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> preaching he checked the spread of <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, renewed and re-established Divine services, and restored <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, especially in the great <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> of Mets and in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. After four years he was transferred, 22 Aug., 1621, to the <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Diocese of Marseilles</a>; but ill-health kept him from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. He secured Fran&ccedil;ois de Lom&eacute;nie as his coadjutor, but he himself remained at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> until his death. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in St. Thomas's <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St-Jacques. Coeffeteau's writings are chiefly polemical. Five treatises on the Eucharist were occasioned by a controversy with Pierre du Moulin, <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> minister of Charenton. Another series on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and pontifical authority was prompted by the action of the Fremich <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in relation to political and religious disturbances in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. At the request of <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>, Coeffeteau wrote a refutation of the "De Republic&acirc; Christian&acirc;" by the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14207a.htm">Spalato</a>, Marc' Antonio de Dominis. In all these writings, at a time in which partisanship was wont to be violent, Coeffeteau maintained an equable temper and a praiseworthy spirit of moderation, always handling his subjects objectively and dispassionately. His erudition was extraordinary and he was possessed of a rare and penetrating critical judgment. On the question of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power and authority, Coeffeteau's position is described as that of a modified Gallicanism. He held that the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or of an &oelig;cumenical council was restricted to matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and did not bear upon questions of fact or of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. A council, he held, was not superior to a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> except in the case of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, when it could depose the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> incumbent to elect one whose right and authority would be beyond question. In this Coeffeteau differed from the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, which asserted the council's superiority in all cases. Besides being called the father of French eloquence, Coeffeteau was a recognized master of the <a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French language</a>. He was the first to use it as a means of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> expression, and the purity of his diction, especially in his historical writings and translations, is admitted and commended by many excellent authorities.
