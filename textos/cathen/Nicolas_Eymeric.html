<h1>Nicolas Eymeric</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a> and inquisitor, born at <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">Gerona</a>, in <a href="../cathen/03428a.htm">Catalonia</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, c. 1320; died there 4 January, 1399. He entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> at an early age, receiving the habit 4 August, 1334, from the hands of Prior Petrus Carpi, and soon won a reputation for <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. His earliest writings, which date from 1351, were of a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> character. Nicola Roselli, the grand inquisitor of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, having been raised to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> (1356), Eymeric was appointed his successor in the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> early in 1357. The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he displayed in his new office roused much opposition and even open enmity. In spite of the support of Cardinal Legate Guido, Eymeric, in the interest of peace, was removed from office at the general chapter held at Perpignan in 1360. Two years later, at the general chapter held at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, he was chosen vicar of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> province of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. Shortly afterwards, when a provincial was to be elected for the same province, there was a hopeless division among the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, one party supporting Eymeric, the other Father Bernardo Ermengaudi. <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Pope Urban V</a> confirmed neither, but appointed a third, Jacopo Dominici.

<p>Meanwhile Eymeric showed great activity as a preacher, as well as a writer on <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> subjects. Some years later he was inquisitor general of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>; we find him in this office in 1366, and several tractates on dogmatic subjects date from the years immediately following. He combated in particular <a href="../cathen/12670c.htm">Raymond Lully</a>, in whose writings he found numerous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. He influenced <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> to forbid the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to read certain writings of Lully's and to condemn by a special <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> (26 Jan., 1376) several theses extracted from his works. Eymeric was in high esteem with King Pedro IV of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, as well as with <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a>. In 1376 he visited the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and accompanied the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on his return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was still there at the election of <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>, whose claims he vigorously championed against those of the Roman <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Towards the end of 1378 he returned to <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, but in the interests of his office as grand inquisitor often went to the court of <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. Eymeric continued his campaign against the Luilists by word as well as by pen. In his "Tractatus contra doctrinam Raymundi Lulli", dedicated to <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>, he indicates 135 <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, 38 <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, and many misleading statements of Lully. He also composed a "Dialogus contra Lullistas" and other treatises. Lully's partisans, however, won over to their side, soon after his accession, King John I of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. Eymeric was banished and went to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, where he was welcomed both by <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a> and later by <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>. He wrote numerous <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works and also special tractates defending the legitimacy of the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, e.g. his "Tractatus de potestate papali" (1383), which he composed for <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>, and two tractates for <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>. Notwithstanding his sentence of banishment, he still retained his post of grand inquisitor of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. As early as 1376 he had compiled, as a guide for inquisitors, his Directorium inquisitorum", the only one of his more extensive works that was afterwards printed (Barcelona, 1503; Rome, 1578, ed. Francesco Pegna, with a copious commentary; reissued several times). Towards the end of 1397 Eymeric returned to his native land and his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06530a.htm">Gerona</a>, where he died. His epitaph describes him as <em>praedicator veridicus, inquisitor intrepidus, doctor egregius.</em>
