<h1>Nicolas Letourneux</h1>  

<p>A well-known French preacher and <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> writer of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> tendencies, born at <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, 30 April, 1640; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 28 November, 1686. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were poor, but the conspicuous talents and the gift of eloquence he displayed even at an early age attracted the attention of some wealthy benefactors, whose assistance enabled him to study the humanities at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and later philosophy at the Coll&egrave;ge des Grassins. To Dr. Hersant, his teacher at the latter institution, may be traced the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> views which mar his writings. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> in 1662, he served for some years as <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> there. About 1670 he removed to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, became closely associated with the Port-Royalists, and began to cultivate <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> asceticism. He exchanged his soutane for a coarse grey robe and abstained from celebrating Mass, to expiate in this manner what he esteemed his guilt in having accepted <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> at so early an age (22). His intercourse with Lema&icirc;tre restored him to more normal views; returning to pastoral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, he acted as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> at the Coll&egrave;ge des Grassins. His sermons at various <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> churches quickly placed him in the front rank of the preachers of his day, and in 1675 his work on the text "Martha, Martha, thou art careful" (<a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs41">Luke 10:41</a>) won the Balzac prize for eloquence awarded by the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a>. In such esteem was he held by his spiritual superiors that Archbishop de Harlay appointed him, in 1679, temporary confessor of the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of Port-Royal, and also a member of the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> commission for the emendation of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>. His relations with the leading <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, however, soon awakened distrust, and he found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to retire, in 1682, to the Priory of Villiers-sur-F&egrave;re, a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> granted him by his patron, <a href="../cathen/04096a.htm">Cardinal Colbert of Rouen</a>.

<p>In this retirement he devoted the remainder of his life to his ascetical compositions. His principal writings are: "Histoire de la vie de Jesus-Christ" (about 1673); "Le cat&eacute;chisme de la p&eacute;nitence" (1676); "L'Ann&eacute;e chr&eacute;tienne, ou les Messes des Dimanches, F&eacute;ries et F&ecirc;tes de toute l'ann&eacute;e, en latin et en fran&ccedil;ais, avec l'explication des Ep&icirc;tres et des Evangiles et un abr&eacute;g&eacute; de la Vie des Saints, dont on fait l'Office". Of this last work Letourneux wrote nine volumes, and two were added by the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a>, Ruth d'Ans. Six volumes were published before 1686, when they were condemned for their <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> views. The work was placed on the <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">Index</a> on 7 Sept., 1695. Among the other works of Letourneux may be mentioned: "Principes et r&egrave;gles de la vie chr&eacute;tienne" (Paris, 1688); "Explication litt&eacute;raire et morale de l'&eacute;p&icirc;tre de S. Paul aux Romains" (Paris, 1695); "Br&eacute;viaire Romain en latin et fran&ccedil;ais" (4 vols., Paris, 1687), condemned by the archiepiscopal authorities because it was an innovation contrary to the spirit and practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and because it contained much that was <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> and much that was conducive to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Although the episcopal ban was subsequently removed, and the work was never placed on the Roman Index, the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> leanings of Letourneux stand conspicuous today in this as in the remainder of his writings.
