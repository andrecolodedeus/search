<h1>Nicolas Malebranche</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratory of St. Philip Neri</a>; b. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 6 Aug., 1638; d. 13 Oct 1715. He was the youngest child of Nicolas Malebranche, secretary to Louis XIII; being slightly deformed in person and of a weak constitution, he received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> from a domestic tutor, until he was old enough to enter the course of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the Coll&egrave;ge de La Marche, whence he passed to the Sorbonne for the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. On the completion of his studies, declining a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> at Notre-Dame, he joined the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> house of the Oratory, 1660. There he was first engaged on <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, but neither his talents nor his taste lay in this direction, and on the recommendation of Richard Simon he turned to the study of Scripture, only to find this study equally uncongenial. A chance reading of <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes'</a> "Trait&eacute; de l'homme ou de la formation du foetus" determined his future career, and he became an enthusiastic <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesian</a>. He published "Recherche de la V&eacute;rit&eacute;" in 1674, and his subsequent works represent developments or special aspects of the same <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>.

<p>Sensation and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> he maintains are produced not by the objects but by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and are intended to serve man's practical needs only, and not to reveal the nature of things, the essence of matter; being extension and its only real <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> motion. The real nature of the external world must be found in <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Now in accordance with <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes'</a> <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> of mind and matter, matter cannot act on mind; and mind cannot produce its own <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, for they are spiritual beings whose creation requires a greater power even than the creation of things material. Therefore we see all things in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, he argues, sees all things in His own perfections, and He is so closely united to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by His Presence that He may be said to be the place of spirits, as space is the place of bodies. And so the mind may see in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> all the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, supposing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> willing to reveal them. That <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should so will seems more in accord with His economy in nature, where He works by the most direct as simple methods. But the strongest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of all, Malebranche finds in the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> we have of the Infinite; for it must be prior to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the finite, and all particular <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are participations of that general <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the Infinite, just as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> derives not His Being from creatures but all creatures have their subsistence from Him. Thus of all the things that come under our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> none but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Himself without the mediation of any <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> bodies and their properties are seen in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and by their <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. As for our own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he adds, it is known only by consciousness, that is, by our sensations, so that, though we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the existence of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> better than the existence of our body or of the things about us, we have not so perfect a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the nature of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. As for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of other men, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, only by conjecture (Recherche, bk. III, pt. ii, cc. 1-8). It is obvious that Malebranche's occasionalism not only makes our <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of the external world depend upon <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">God's revelation</a>; it suggests the objection that there is no purpose in a material <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> which is out of all contact with human thought and volition. What is peculiar, however, to his system is its <a href="../cathen/11257a.htm">Ontologism</a>, and its consequences; for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is made not only the immediate cause of our sensations, but also the "place of our ideas", and moreover our first <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. From this it would appear to follow that we see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> Essence, though Malebranche protested explicitly against this consequence. And, if, as Malebranche maintains, the essence of mind consists only in thought, as the essence of matter consists only in extension, there is at least a suggestion of the <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> which he so vigorously repudiated.

<p>With regard to <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> also, the desire of Malebranche to emphasize the union of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with its Creator exposed him to many objections. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he says, has the capacity of withholding its consent to a particular object, so that the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> may recognize the lower as the higher good. But volition, according to him, being an effect of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> action on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it was objected that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was thus the author of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. To this Malebranche answered that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was due to an intermission of activity, therefore <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is nothing and though <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does all He is not the author of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This account of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> Malebranche utilizes to maintain a sort of Optimism in his account of creation. Finite creation as such would be unworthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; it is made a worthy object of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will by the Incarnation; and as for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that is in creation, it is due to particular wills, and it does actually enhance the real good.

<p>Antoine Arnauld was the first to attack Malebranche's system, and he was supported by <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> who styled the system <em>"pulchra, nova, falsa"</em>. Naturally a chief topic of discussion was the question of grace, though the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> and the Oratorian both claimed the authority of St. Augustine. The discussion gradually became very bitter, and ended not altogether to the credit of Malebranche's <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, for it was Malebranche who had been on his defence, and his work had been censured at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Among other opponents of Malebranche there Pierre Silvain Regis and Dom Fran&ccedil;ois Lamy, who attacked his explanation of pleasure and of good. His answer in "Trait&eacute; de glamour de Dieu" was well received in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and had the further good fortune of reconciling him with <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>. His "Entretiens d'un philosophe chr&eacute;tien et d'un philosophe chinois sur l'existence de Dieu", in which he accused the Chinese of <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheism</a>, drew from the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Fr. Tournemine and Fr. <a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a>, a counter charge of Spinozism and <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheism</a> against his own system. There can be little question of the novelty and dangerous character of his publications. But his own loyalty, his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> are still less questionable. He led a simple and austere life, giving himself but little rest from his studies, and finding his chief relaxation in the company of little children. He was of an affable disposition, always ready go converse with the numerous visitors who called to see him. And during his life time his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> as a thinker and writer was remarkably high. The following are his principal works: &mdash; "Recherche de la V&eacute;rit&eacute;" (1674): two English versions "Conversations chr&eacute;tiennes" 1677); "Trait&eacute; de la nature et de la gr&acirc;ce" (1680); "M&eacute;ditations chr&eacute;tiennes et m&eacute;taphysiques" (1677); "Trait&eacute; de morale" (1684); "Entretiens sur la m&eacute;taphysique et sur la religion" (1687); "Trait&eacute; de l'amour de Dieu" (1698); "R&eacute;ponses" (to Arnauld), published together, 1709, etc., two editions of his works by Jules Simon, 2nd (1871) not complete.
