<h1>Nicolas Ysambert</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> in 1565 of 1569; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 14 May, 1642. He studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a> and was made a fellow (<em>socius</em>) of the college in 1598. Thenceforth he professed <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> with such success as to attract public attention. In 1616 King Louis XIII founded at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a> a new chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> for the study of the controversial questions between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The professor in charge had to give on every working day an hour's lecture followed by a half hour of familiar conference with his auditors. Ysambert was appointed to this chair by the king, who in this instance had reserved to himself the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a>. This appointment, which was an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in itself, was still more enhanced by the eulogies bestowed on Ysambert in the letters patent which designated him, wherein the king praises his competence and station, his experiences in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, controverted matters, and other <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. From the time of his appointment as is evident from the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of his course, one of which is preserved at the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, which was begun in 1618, Ysambert took as the basis of his letters the <a href="../summa/index.html"><em>Summa theologica</em></a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> which he seems to have commentated until the end of his career of teaching. His lessons won him a wide reputation, which he retained until his death. In the councils of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty he was chiefly distinguished for his share in the censure directed against Marc Antonio de Dominis, the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Spalatro, the author of the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> treatise <em>De republica christiana</em>, which was intended to overthrow the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Hierarchy; he was the first to point out the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> to the faculty and he brought about is condemnation. When Edmond Richer laboured to revive in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty a somewhat modified Gallicanism, Ysambert with the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> Duval became the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> defender of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. To learning Ysambert joined great strictness of life, remarkable solidity of judgment, and a precision and sense of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> much appreciated in the decision of cases of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. He began publishing his <em>Disputationes</em>, or commentaries on the Summa of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, but it was not completed during his life (Paris, 1638-48). His commentary is generally esteemed.
