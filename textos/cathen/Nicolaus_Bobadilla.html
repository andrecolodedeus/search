<h1>Nicolaus Bobadilla</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 1511; died at Loretto, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 23 September, 1590. After having taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in his native country, he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to acquire a more perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Greek and Latin. Here he met <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">Ignatius of Loyola</a>, joined him in his plans, and was among the first seven followers of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at Montmartre, 15 August, 1534. Hereafter, Bobadilla's career was a very active one, as a most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> worker in the cause of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. While serving the sick in the camp of the army of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> about <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, he himself caught the plague. Here, too, about this time, 1546, as he was returning from the camp into the city, he was waylaid by assassins and severely wounded. At another time he barely escaped with his life from an attempt to poison him.

<p>By order of the <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff Paul III</a>, Bobadilla took a prominent part in the Diets of Nuremburg, 1543, and of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, 1543, as well as in that of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, 1546. Shortly after this an incident occurred which forced him to leave <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In 1548, the "Interim" of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> was published by the Emperor, <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. It was a tentative document intended to suggest a basis of agreement between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> until their religious differences could be definitely settled. But as it seemed to the eyes of many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to go to far, and in the eyes of many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> not far enough, it satisfied neither party. Bobadilla opposed it in speech and in writing, and so vigorously, that though he was highly esteemed in the imperial court, he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a>, by the Emperor's order, to retire from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He was a most popular preacher, as evidenced by the fact that he delivered <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> in seventy-seven archbishoprics and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>.

<p>The writings of Bobadilla cover a wide range of topics. Among them are <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commentaries</a> on some chapters of Genesis and other portions of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a>; annotations on the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>; treatises on <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and their use, against the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>; cases of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; a defense of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> against <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, etc. The last survivor of the seven first companions of <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">Ignatius of Loyola</a>, Bobadilla took part in the election of four generals of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>.
