<h1>Nicolaus Copernicus</h1>  

<p>Latinized form of Niclas Kopernik, the name of the founder of the heliocentric planetary theory; born at Torun (Thorn), 19 February, 1473, died at Frauenburg, 24 May, 1543.
<h2>Early life</h2>

<p>Whether the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> came originally from <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a> or from <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, certain it is that his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> Niclas, a merchant, <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> from <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Krakow</a> to Torun, and married the sister of Lucas Watzelrode, later Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/05522a.htm">Ermland</a>. Of the four children the oldest and youngest, Andreas and Nicolaus, adopted the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> career, while the older girl became a <a href="../cathen/03790a.htm">Cistercian nun</a> and <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a> of <a href="../cathen/04566a.htm">Culm</a>, and the younger <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a>. The whole <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> belonged to the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm#IV">Third Order</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">St. Dominic</a>. Nicolaus was hardly ten years old when his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> died. His uncle, Lucas, however, took charge of the children and gave the boys a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> training.

<p>Nicolaus Nicolai de Thorunia was matriculated in <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Krakow</a> in 1491, where he studied classics, mathematics, drawings, and perspective. Professor Blar, who represented <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, belonged to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Ptolemy. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, himself a former student of <a href="../cathen/02641b.htm">Bologna</a>, sent the boys to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In 1497 Nicolaus was enrolled in the <a href="../cathen/02641b.htm">University of Bologna</a> as of German nationality and a student in canon law. He also studied Greek and became a disciple of <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a>, then professor of <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>. To obtain for his nephews the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> support, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> procured their <a href="../cathen/05374b.htm">election</a> as canons by the <a href="../cathen/03582b.htm">chapter</a> of Frauenburg (1497-1498).

<p>In the spring of 1500 the brothers went from <a href="../cathen/02641b.htm">Bologna</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the <a href="../cathen/08531c.htm">jubilee</a>. According to George Joachim, surnamed "Rheticus" (because a native of Feldkirch, in ancient <a href="../cathen/13018b.htm">Rhaetia</a>) and his friend Achilles Gasser, Copernicus gave <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> lectures in the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>, and it was there that he awoke to his vocation of founding a new <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>. The brothers obtained from the <a href="../cathen/03582b.htm">chapter</a> of Frauenburg a two years' leave of absence to continue their studies. From 1501 to 1503 Nicolaus was in <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a> and <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> studying <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> he took his degree of Doctor of Canon Law but no document is found of his graduating in <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a>. His proficiency in that profession was, however, later evinced by his renown as a physician at the episcopal court of Heilsberg, where his uncle resided.

<p>After his <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> studies Copernicus practised <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> for six years (1506-1512) at Heilsberg, being sought by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and princes, but especially by the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, whom he served <em>gratis</em>. There is no document to show that Copernicus ever received higher <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">orders</a>. His medical practice, which was only private, would not speak against him being a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and the fact that in 1537 King Sigismund of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> put his name on the list of four candidates for the vacant episcopal seat of <a href="../cathen/05522a.htm">Ermland</a>, makes it probable that, at least in later life, he had entered the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. After the death of his uncle, in 1512, Copernicus went to Frauenburg for the <a href="../cathen/05374b.htm">election</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and remained there until 1516, when he was <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nominated</a> administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> castle of Allenstein. His term of four years being over, he returned to the chapter in Frauenburg. Three years later the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> died, and Copernicus became <a href="../cathen/01143a.htm">administrator</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. While the quiet life at Heilsberg had left him enough leisure to publish a Latin translation of the Greek letters of Theophylactus (1509), his public offices gradually drew him into the study of finance. In 1522 he wrote a memorandum on monetary reforms, which five years later grew into a Latin treatise. It was so highly thought of that the King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> substantially accepted it (1528), and Copernicus was nominated deputy counsellor on the financial regulations of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> (1522-29).
<h2>Copernicus as astronomer</h2>

<p>These various offices, however, could not distract the genius of Copernicus from the main thought of his life. The towers of Heilsberg, of Allenstein, and of Frauenburg became so many observatories, and his great work "on the Revolutions of the Celestial Bodies" bears testimony to his unremitting observations of sun, moon, and planets. His reputation was such that as early as 1514 the <a href="../cathen/09018b.htm">Lateran Council</a>, convoked by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, asked through Bishop Paul of <a href="../cathen/06154b.htm">Fossombrone</a>, for his opinion on the <a href="../cathen/03168a.htm">reform</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">ecclesiastical calendar</a>. His answer was, that the length of the year and of the months and the motions of the sun and moon were not yet sufficiently known to attempt a reform. The incident, however, spurred him on as he himself writes to <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, to make more accurate observations; and these actually served, seventy years later, as a basis for the working out of the Gregorian calendar.

<p>Twenty-five years after his <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> career, he had finished his great work, at least in his own mind, but hesitated a long time, whether to publish it or to imitate the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagoreans</a>, who transmitted the mysteries of their philosophy only orally to their own disciples for fear of exposing them to the contempt of the multitude. His friends who had become interested in the new theory prevailed on him to write at least an abstract for them, <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> copies of which have been discovered in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1873) and <a href="../cathen/14297a.htm">Stockholm</a> (1878). In this commentary Copernicus stated his theory in the form of seven axioms, reserving the mathematical part for the Principal work. This was in 1531, or twelve years before his death. From this on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the heliocentric system began to spread. In 1533 Albert Widmanstadt lectured before <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Pope Clement VII</a> on the Copernican solar system. His reward consisted in a Greek codex which is preserved in the State <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>. Three years later Copernicus was urged by Cardinal Schonberg, then <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, in a letter, dated at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1 November, 1536, to publish his discovery, or at least to have a copy made at the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> expense. But all the urging of friends was in vain, until a younger man was providentially sent to his side.

<p>It was George Joachim Rheticus who quitted his chair of mathematics in <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> in order to spend two years at the feet of the new master (1539-41). Hardly ten weeks after his arrival in Frauenburg he sent a "First Narration" of the new solar system to his scientific friend Sch&ouml;ner in <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, in the form of a letter of sixty-six pages, which was soon after printed in Danzig (1540) and <a href="../cathen/02338a.htm">Basle</a> (1541). Rheticus next obtained for publication the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of a preliminary chapter of the great work on plane and spherical trigonometry. Finally Copernicus, feeling the weight of his sixty-eight years, yielded, as he writes to <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, to the entreaties of Cardinal Schonberg, of Bishop Giese of <a href="../cathen/04566a.htm">Culm</a>, and of other learned men to surrender his <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> for publication. Bishop Giese charged Rheticus, as the ablest disciple of the great master, with the task of editing the work. The intention of the latter was to take the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> to <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a> and have it published at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> but owing to the hostility prevailing there against the Copernican system, only the chapter on trigonometry was printed (1542). The two copies of the "First Narration" and of the treatise on trigonometry, which Rheticus presented to his friend Dr. Gasser, then practising <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> in Feldkirch, may be seen in the Vatican Library (Palat. IV, 585) Rheticus then turned to Sch&ouml;ner in <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, who, together with Osiander, accepted the charge and engaged the printing-house of Petreius in the same city. In the meanwhile Rheticus tried to resume his chair in <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, but on account of his Copernican views had to resign (1542) and turned to <a href="../cathen/09140a.htm">Leipzig</a> (1543). He was thus prevented from giving his personal attention to the edition, nor was the author himself able to superintend it. Copernicus became paralyzed on the right side and weakened in memory and mind many days before his death. The first copy of the "Six Books on the Revolutions of the Celestial Orbits" was handed to him the very day he died. Fortunately for him, he could not see what Osiander had done. This reformer, knowing the attitude of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> against the heliocentric system, introduced the word "Hypothesis" on the title page, and without adding his own name, replaced the preface of Copernicus by another strongly contrasting in spirit with that of Copernicus. The preface of Osiander warns the reader not to expect anything certain from <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, nor to accept its hypothesis as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, <em>ne stultior ab hac disciplin&acirc; discedat, quam accesserit</em>. The dedication to <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a> was, however, retained, and the text of the work remained intact, as was ascertained later when access was had to the original <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, now in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the Counts Nostitz in <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>.

<p>Opposition was first raised against the Copernican system by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> for <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Biblical</a> reasons and strange to say it has continued, at least sporadically, to our own days. A list of many of their Pamphlets is enumerated by Beckmann. On the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side opposition only commenced seventy-three years later, when it was occasioned by <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo</a>. On 5 March, 1616, the work of Copernicus was forbidden by the Congregation of the Index "until corrected", and in 1620 these corrections were indicated. Nine sentences, by which the heliocentric system was represented as certain, had to be either omitted or changed. This done, the reading of the book was allowed. In 1758 the book of Copernicus disappeared from the revised <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">Index</a> of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>. New editions were issued in <a href="../cathen/02338a.htm">Basle</a> (1566) by Rheticus; in <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a> (1617) by M&uuml;ller of G&ouml;ttingen, in <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a> (1854) an edition <em>de luxe</em> with <a href="../cathen/12196a.htm">Polish</a> translation and the real preface of Copernicus; and the latest (5th) in Torun (1873) by the Copernicus Society, on the four hundredth anniversary of the author's birthday, with all the corrections of the text, made by Copernicus, given as foot-notes. A monument by Thorwaldsen was erected to Copernicus in <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a> (1830), and another by Tieck at Torun (1853). Rheticus, <a href="../cathen/04009a.htm">Clavius</a>, and others called Copernicus the second Ptolemy, and his book the second "Almagest." His genius appears in the fact that he grasped the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> centuries before it could be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. If he had precursors they are to be compared to those of <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a>. What is most significant in the character of Copernicus is this, that while he did not shrink from demolishing a scientific system <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by a thousand years' universal acceptance, he set his face against the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">reformers</a> of religion.
