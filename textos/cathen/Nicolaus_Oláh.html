<h1>Nicolaus Ol&aacute;h</h1>  

<p>(OLAHUS)

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a> and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, a distinguished <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, born 10 January, 1493, at Nagyszeben (Hermanstadt); died at Nagyszombat, 15 Jan., 1568, His father, Stephen, a brother-in-law of <a href="../cathen/07564b.htm">John Hunyadi</a>, was of Wallachian descent; his mother was Barbara Husz&aacute;r (also known as Csaszar). His autobiographical notes and correspondence throw light on his life. After having studied at the Chapter School of V&aacute;rad from 1505 to 1512, he became a page at the court of <a href="../cathen/15680b.htm">Wladislaw</a> II, but shortly afterwards chose an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> career, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1516 or 1518. While acting as secretary to Georg Szatm&aacute;ry, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06322b.htm">F&uuml;nfkirchen</a>, he was appointed a canon of that chapter, later of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>, and 1522 became <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Komorn. In 1526 he was made secretary to King Louis II; but was transferred to the service of Queen Maria. After the battle of Moh&aacute;es, Ol&aacute;h attached himself to the party of King Ferdinand I, but retained his position with the queen-dowager. In 1527 he was appointed "custos" or head of the Chapter of <a href="../cathen/14317a.htm">Stuhlweissenburg</a>, and accompanied the queen-dowager in 1530 to the imperial diet at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>. When in 1531 she became Stadtholder of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, he went with her to <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, where he remained (with a brief interruption in 1539) until his return to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> in 1542. In the following year he was made by Ferdinand I royal chancellor and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01225b.htm">Agram</a>. In 1548 he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Erlau, and in 1553 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>. As such he <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Maximilian King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and performed the solemn obsequies (1563) over Ferdinand I. As <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>, Ol&aacute;h's first care was to put order into the finances and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the archdiocese, He had the "Jus Piseti" again enforced, i, e. the right of supervision over the mint at K&ouml;rm&ouml;czb&aacute;nya, for which surveillance the archdiocese enjoyed a large revenue. At his own expense, he redeemed the hypothecated provostship of Tur&oacute;cz, also the encumbered possessions of the <a href="../cathen/10774c.htm">Diocese of Neutra</a>. Ol&aacute;h likewise, as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>, exercised a supervision over the Diocese of Erlau, and (with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>) administered the Archdiocese of Kalocsa, vacant for 20 years. After the capture of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> residence was at Nagyszombat or Pozsonv.

<p>Ol&aacute;h was particularly active in the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>; even before his elevation to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>, he had been a very <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> opponent of the new <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> teachings. As <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> he threw himself with renewed energy into the great conflict, aiming especially at the purity of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, the restoration of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, the reformation of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the establishment of new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The mountain cities of Upper <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, in which the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> had made considerable progress, attracted his particular attention. He organized a visitation of the archdiocese, which he in great part conducted in person, besides convoking, with a similar intention, a number of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. The first of these <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> was held in 1560 at Nagyszombat; at its close he <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> a code of dogmatic and moral instructions, intended for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, published during that and the following year. In 1561 a provincial synod was held, likewise at Nagyszombat, to discuss the participation of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, shortly before re-convened. While it is not <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that Ol&aacute;h took part in that council, or that he <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> its decrees of 1562 and 1564, it is known that he followed its deliberations with close attention and practically adopted in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> some of its decisions. In 1563 Ol&aacute;h submitted to the council a lengthy memorial, in which he urged the importance of dealing with the critical situation of the Hungarian Church and describing in strong language the efforts he had made to overcome the demoralization that had seized on the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. It was particularly through school-reform and the proper instruction of youth that he hoped to offset the progress of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. He restored the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>, which had fallen into decay when that city was captured by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>; he transferred it, however, to his <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> city of Nagyszombat and confided it to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, whom he invited to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> in 1561, and who, by their preaching and spiritual ministrations, profoundly influenced the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the nation. Among the publications initiated by him were the "Breviarium Ecclesi&aelig; Strigoniensis" (1558), and the "Ordo et Ritus Ecclesi&aelig; Strigoniensis" (1560). The revival of the custom of ringing the Angelus was due to him. As chancellor and confidant of Ferdinand I, Ol&aacute;h possessed much political influence, which he exercised in the special interest of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. In 1562 he acted as royal Stadtholder. He was a diligent writer; his works ("Hungaria et Attila"; "Genesis filiorum Regis Ferdinandi"; "Ephemerides", and "Brevis descriptio vit&aelig; Benedicti Zerchsky") were edited by Kovachich, in Vol. I of the "Scriptores minores".
