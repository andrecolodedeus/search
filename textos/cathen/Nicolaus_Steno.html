<h1>Nicolaus Steno</h1>  

<p>(Niels Steensen)

<p>An eminent <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomist</a> and geologist, <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a> and saintly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/04352a.htm">Copenhagen</a>, 1 January, 1638; died at Schwerin in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, 25 November, 1686.

<p>For many years the name of Steno was almost forgotten; in <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> he was centuries in advance of his time. During the last thirty years <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> has been done to his merits as a scientist. When a young man of twenty-two years he went to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> to proceed with his anatomic studies; there he discovered, among other things, the excretory duct of the parotid glands (<em>ductus Stenonianus</em>) and the circulation of the blood in the human body. In spite of his achievements his countrymen failed to appoint him professor at the <a href="../cathen/04352a.htm">University of Copenhagen</a>, in consequence of which he went to <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, where he was cordially received by the Grand Duke of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. He was appointed anatomist at the Hospital of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Nuova and continued his researches. Even while residing in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> he had begun to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> doctrines. At Cologne he conferred with a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, and at Florence he became convinced of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. After many struggles he entered the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on 4 November, 1667. Shortly after a royal letter came from <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, that called him home and offered him a high annual salary. But it was too late; as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> he could not return to <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. He remained in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and made many geological discoveries, which were not appreciated until our time. He was also the first who gave a scientific explanation of the many petrifactions which are found in the earth. In <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> men began to regret Steno's loss, and through the influence of Griffenfeldt he was nominated, not professor &#151; for a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> could not hold that position &#151; but <em>anatomicus regius</em> in his native city, but he remained there only two years, as he was exposed to narrow-minded treatment.

<p>Feeling a higher call, he returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where he received <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> in 1675, and two years after was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. As such, he lived a most self-denying and mortified life, giving all he had to the poor. He was made <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> for the northern missions and worked nine years as an apostle in the north of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He died, worn out by his labours at the early age of forty-eight. His remains were brought to Florence and deposited in a vault in the Basilica of <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>. He wrote several ascetic works. Of his sixteen <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works the more interesting are his "Epistola de propria conversione" (Florence, 1677), and "Defensio et plenior elucidatio epistol&aelig; de propria conversione" (Hanover, 1680). His scientific writings were published by Maar, "Nicolai Stenonis opera philosophica" (2 vols., Copenhagen, 1910), a very fine work in quarto, containing his thirty-two anatomical dissertations, with introduction and notes in English. A facsimile edition of his "De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento dissertationis prodromus" appeared at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> in 1904.
