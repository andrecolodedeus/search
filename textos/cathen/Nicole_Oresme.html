<h1>Nicole Oresme</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">Philosopher</a>, <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economist</a>, mathematician, and <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physicist</a>, one of the principal founders of modern <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>; b. in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/02358b.htm">Diocese of Bayeux</a>; d. at Lisieux, 11 July, 1382. In 1348 he was a student of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; in 1356 grand master of the Coll&egrave;ge de Navarre; in 1362, already master of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, canon of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>; dean of the chapter, 28 March, 1364. On 3 August, 1377, he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lisieux. There is a tradition that he was tutor to the dauphin, afterwards Charles V, but this is irreconcilable with the dates of Oresme's life. Charles seems to have had the highest esteem for his character and talents, often followed his counsel, and made him write many works in French for the purpose of developing a taste for learning in the kingdom. At Charles's instance, too, Oresme pronounced a discourse before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, denouncing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> disorders of the time. Several of the French and Latin works attributed to him are <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> or <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. Of his authentic writings, a <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a> treatise, "De communicatione idiomatum in Christo", was commonly used as early as the fifteenth century by the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> Faculty of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.

<p>But Oresme is best known as an <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economist</a>, mathematician, and a <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physicist</a>. His <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> views are contained in a Commentary on the Ethics of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, of which the French version is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1370; a commentary on the Politics and the Economics of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, French edition, 1371; and a "Treatise on Coins". These three works were written in both Latin and French; all three, especially the last, stamp their author as the precursor of the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of political economy, and reveal his mastery of the <a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French language</a>. The French Commentary on the Ethics of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> was printed in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1488; that on the Politics and the Economics, in 1489. The treatise on <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, "De origine, natura, jure et mutationibus monetarum", was printed in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> early in the sixteenth century, also at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in 1675, as an appendix to the "De re monetaria" of Marquardus Freherus, and is included in the "Sacra bibliotheca sanctorum Patrum" of <a href="../cathen/02566a.htm">Margaronus de la Bigne IX</a>, (Paris, 1859), p. 159, and in the "Acta publica monetaria" of David Thomas de Hagelstein (Augsburg, 1642). The "Traicti&eacute; de la premi&egrave;re invention des monnoies" in French, was printed at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> in 1477.

<p>His most important contributions to mathematics are contained in "Tractatus de figuratione potentiarum et mensurarum difformitatum", still in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>. An abridgment of this work printed as "Tractatus de latitudinibus formarum" (1482, 1486, 1505, 1515), has heretofore been the only source for the study of his mathematical <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. In a quality, or accidental form, such as heat, the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> distinguished the <em>intensio</em> (the degree of heat at each point) and the <em>extensio</em> (e.g., the length of the heated rod): these two terms were often replaced by <em>latitudo</em> and <em>longitudo</em>, and from the time of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> until far on in the fourteenth century, there was lively debate on the <em>latitudo form&aelig;</em>. For the sake of lucidity, Oresme conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of employing what we should now call rectangular co-ordinates: in modern terminology, a length proportionate to the <em>longitudo</em> was the abscissa at a given point, and a perpendicular at that point, proportional to the <em>latitudo</em>, was the ordinate. He shows that a geometrical <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of such a figure could be regarded as corresponding to a <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the form itself only when this <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> remains constant while the units measuring the <em>longitudo</em> and <em>latitudo</em> vary. Hence he defines <em>latitudo uniformis</em> as that which is represented by a line parallel to the longitude, and any other <em>latitudo</em> is <em>difformis</em>; the <em>latitudo uniformiter difformis</em> is represented by a right line inclined to the axis of the longitude. He proves that this definition is equivalent to an algebraical relation in which the longitudes and latitudes of any three points would figure: i.e., he gives the equation of the right line, and thus forestalls <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a> in the invention of analytical geometry. This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> he extends to figures of three dimensions.

<p>Besides the longitude and latitude of a form, he considers the <em>mensura</em>, or <em>quantitas</em>, of the form, proportional to the area of the figure representing it. He proves this theorem: A form <em>uniformiter difformis</em> has the same quantity as a form <em>uniformis</em> of the same longitude and having as latitude the mean between the two extreme limits of the first. He then shows that his method of figuring the latitude of forms is applicable to the movement of a point, on condition that the time is taken as longitude and the speed as latitude; quantity is, then, the space covered in a given time. In virtue of this transposition, the theorem of the latitude <em>uniformiter difformis</em> became the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the space traversed in case of uniformly varied motion: Oresme's demonstration is exactly the same as that which <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo</a> was to render celebrated in the seventeenth century. Moreover, this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was never forgotten during the interval between Oresme and <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo</a>: it was taught at Oxford by William Heytesbury and his followers, then, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, by all the followers of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. In the middle of the sixteenth century, long before <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galileo</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Dominic Soto applied the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to the uniformly accelerated falling of heavy bodies and to the uniformly decreasing ascension of projectiles.

<p>Oresme's physical teachings are set forth in two French works, the "Trait&eacute; de la sph&egrave;re", twice printed in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (first edition without date; second, 1508), and the "Trait&eacute; du ciel et du monde", written in 1377 at the request of King Charles V, but never printed. In most of the essential problems of statics and dynamics, Oresme follows the opinions advocated in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> by his predecessor, <a href="../cathen/03078a.htm">Jean Buridan de B&eacute;thune</a>, and his contemporary, Albert de Saxe (see Saxe, Albert de). In opposition to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> theory of weight, according to which the natural location of heavy bodies is the centre of the world, and that of light bodies the concavity of the moon's orb, he proposes the following: The elements tend to dispose themselves in such manner that, from the centre to the periphery their specific weight diminishes by degrees. He thinks that a similar rule may exist in worlds other than this. This is the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> later substituted for the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> by <a href="../cathen/04352b.htm">Copernicus</a> and his followers, such as <a href="../cathen/03016a.htm">Giordano Bruno</a>. The latter argued in a manner so similar to Oresme's that it would seem he had read the "Trait&eacute; du ciel et du monde". But Oresme had a much stronger claim to be regarded as the precursor of <a href="../cathen/04352b.htm">Copernicus</a> when one considers what he says of the diurnal motion of the earth, to which he devotes the gloss following chapters xxiv and xxv of the "Trait&eacute; du ciel et du monde". He begins by establishing that no experiment can decide whether the heavens move form east to west or the earth from west to east; for sensible experience can never establish more than one relative motion. He then shows that the reasons proposed by the physics of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> against the movement of the earth are not valid; he points out, in particular, the principle of the solution of the difficulty drawn from the movement of projectiles. Next he solves the objections based on the texts of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>; in interpreting these passages he lays down rules universally followed by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> exegetists of the present day. Finally, he adduces the argument of simplicity for the theory that the earth moves, and not the heavens, and the whole of his argument in favour of the earth's motion is both more explicit and much clearer than that given by <a href="../cathen/04352b.htm">Copernicus</a>.
