<h1>Nicol&ograve; Albertini</h1>  

<p>(AUBERTINI)

<p><a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Medieval</a> statesman, b. at <a href="../cathen/12117a.htm">Prato</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, c. &uacute; d. at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, 27 April, 1321. His early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was directed by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, both of whom belonged to illustrious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. At the age of sixteen (1266) he entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> in the Convent of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Novella at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and was sent to the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> to complete his studies. He preached in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> with success, and his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> lectures were especially well attended at Florence and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was entrusted by his superiors with various important <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and governed several houses. He was made <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">Procurator-General</a> of the whole <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">order of St. Dominic</a> by Blessed Nicol&ograve; Bocassini, then Master General, and was afterwards elected Provincial of the Roman Province. In 1299, <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> made him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> and soon afterwards sent him as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Papal Legate</a> to the Kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip IV</a> and Edward I, with a view to reconciling them, a seemingly hopeless task. Albertini succeeded in his mission. The Pope in full consistory thanked him, and made him Vicar of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a> was particularly attached to Albertini, with whom he had lived a long time in the same <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. Shortly after his accession to the Papacy (22 October, 1303) he made Albertini <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> and Dean of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, which office he held for eighteen or nineteen years. The civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> that in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries had devastated a great part of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, especially <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, Romagna, and the March of <a href="../cathen/15038a.htm">Treviso</a>, caused the Pope again to invest the new <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> with the dignity of Apostolic Legate, and to send him to restore peace in those disturbed provinces. His authority was also extended to the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/01661a.htm">Aquila</a>, <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, and those in the territory of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. He was well received by the people of Florence, but after many futile efforts to effect a reconciliation between <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">the Guelphs and the Ghibellines</a> he left the city and placed it under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>. On the 29th of June (1312), in the name of <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, he <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Henry VII of Luxembourg at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Albertini is the leading figure in the trial that exonerated the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Bernardo da Montepulciano, from the charge of killing this king by giving him a poisoned host for Communion. He <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> King Robert of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, son and successor of Charles II. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> was known for his great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, especially for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> of the City of <a href="../cathen/12117a.htm">Prato</a>. He also gave generously to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> and towards the erection of churches. At <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> he established a community of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> similar to those founded by <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> at San Sisto in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He obtained for his Order the office of <a href="../cathen/10039a.htm">"Master of the Sacred Palace"</a>, that has always been held by a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>. Two small works are all that are known of his writings. One is a treatise on <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a>, the other on the manner of holding assemblies of Bishops. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">Church</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>.
