<h1>Nicosia</h1>  

<p>Titular archdiocese in the Province of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>. It is now agreed (Oberhummer' "Aus Cypern" in "Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft fur Erdkunde", 1890, 212-14), that Ledra, Leucotheon, Leucopolis, Leucosia, and Nicosia are the same city, at least the same <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. Ledra is first mentioned by <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> (<a href="../fathers/26021.htm"><em>Church History</em> I.11</a>) in connexion with its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, St. Triphyllius, who lived under Constantine and whom <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (De scriptoribus ecclesiasticis), pronounced the most eloquent of his time. Mention is made also of one of his disciples, St. Diomedes, <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> on 28 October. Under the name of Leucosia the city appears for the first time in the sixth century, in the "Synecdemus" of Hierocles (ed. Burckhardt, 707-8). It was certainly subsequent to the eighth century that Leucosia or Nicosia replaced Constantia as the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, for at the &OElig;cumenical Council of 787 one Constantine signed as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04294a.htm">Constantia</a>; in any case at the conquest of the island in 1191 by <a href="../cathen/13041b.htm">Richard Coeur de Lion</a> Nicosia was the capital. At that time <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> was sold to the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> who established themselves in the castle of Nicosia, but not being able to overcome the hostility of the people of the city, massacred the majority of the inhabitants and sold <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> to Guy de Lusignan, who founded a dynasty there, of which there were fifteen titulars, and did much towards the prosperity of the capital. Nicosia was then made a Latin <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> with three suffragans, <a href="../cathen/11457b.htm">Paphos</a>, Limassol, and <a href="../cathen/05781b.htm">Famagusta</a>. The Greeks who had previously had as many as fourteen titulars were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to be content with four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> bearing the same titles as the Latins but residing in different towns. The list of thirty-one Latin <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> from 1196 to 1502 may be seen in Eubel, "Hierarchia catholica medii aevi", I, 382; II, 224. Quarrels between Greeks and Latins were frequent and prolonged, especially at Nicosia, where the two councils of 1313-60 ended in bloodshed; but in spite of everything the island prospered. There were many beautiful churches in the possession of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>. Other churches belonged to the Greeks, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a>, <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a>, <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> etc. In 1489 <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> fell under the dominion of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and on 9 November, 1570, Nicosia fell into the power of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, who committed atrocious cruelties. Nor was this the last time, for on 9 July, 1821, during the revolt of the Greeks in the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Ottoman Empire</a>, they strangled many of the people of Nicosia, among them the four Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the island. Since 4 June, 1878, <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> has been under the dominion of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Previously Nicosia was the residence of the Mutessarif of the sandjak which depended on the vilayet of the Archipelago. Since the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> occupation of 1571 Nicosia has been the permanent residence of the Greek <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> who governs the autonomous church of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>. The city has 13,000 inhabitants. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> administer the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mission which is dependent on the Latin Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and has a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys. The <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> have a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls.
