<h1>Nikolaus Nilles</h1>  

<p>Born 21 June, 1828, of a wealthy peasant <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Rippweiler, Luxemburg; died 31 January, 1907. After completing his gymnasium studies brilliantly, he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where from 1847 to 1853, as a student of the Collegium Germanicum, he laid the foundation of his ascetic life and, as a pupil of the Gregorian University, under the guidance of distinguished scholars (Ballerini, <a href="../cathen/06242a.htm">Franzelin</a>, <a href="../cathen/11518b.htm">Passaglia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11702b.htm">Perrone</a>, <a href="../cathen/11559a.htm">Patrizi</a>, <a href="../cathen/13590a.htm">Schrader</a>, <a href="../cathen/14458c.htm">Tarquini</a>), prepared the way for his subsequent scholarly career. When he left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1853, he took with him, in addition to the double doctorate of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and canon law, two mementoes which lasted throughout his life: his grey hair and a disease of the heart, the result of the terrors which he had encountered in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the revolutionary year 1848-9. From 1853 to 1858 he labored in his own country as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and during this time made his first literary attempts. In March, 1858, he entered the Austrian Province of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> and, in the autumn of 1859, was summoned by his superiors to <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a> to fill the chair of canon law in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, which Emperor Francis Joseph I had shortly before entrusted to the Austrian <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Nilles lectured throughout his life &mdash; after 1898 usually to the North American <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, to whom he gave special instructions on canonical conditions in their country, for which task no one was better qualified than he. His "Commentaria in Concilium Baltimorense tertium" (1884-90) and his short essay, "Tolerari potest", gained him a wide reputation.

<p>His literary achievements in the fields of canon law, ascetics, and liturgy were abundant and fruitful. Martin Blum enumerates in his by no means complete bibliography fifty-seven works, of which the two principal are: "De rationibus festorum sacratissimi Cordis Jesu et purissimi Cordis Mariae libri quatuor" (2 vols., 5th ed., Innsbruck, 1885) and "Kalendarium manuale utriusque Ecclesiae orientalis et occidentalis" (2 vols., 2nd ed., Innsbruck, 1896). Through the latter work he became widely known in the world of scholars. In particular <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and Orthodox Russians expressed themselves in terms of the highest praise for the Kalendarium or Heortologion. Professor Harnack of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> wrote of it in the "Theologische Literaturzeitung" (XXI, 1896, 350-2): "I have . . . frequently made use of the work . . . and it has always <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a reliable guide. whose information was derived from original sources. There is scarcely another scholar as well versed as the author in the feasts of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is based not only on his own observations, but on books periodicals, papers, and <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendars</a> of the past and present. The Feasts of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>! The title is self-explanatory; yet, though the basis of these ordinances is uniform, the details are of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> variety, since the work treats not only of the Latin but also of the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Eastern Rites</a>. The latter, it is well known, are divided into Greek, Syriac, Coptic, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> . . . Of the second volume Harnack wrote (ibid., XXXIII, 1898, 112 sq.). "Facts which elsewhere would have to be sought under difficulties are here marshaled in lucid order, and a very carefully arranged index facilitates inquiry. Apart from the principal aim of the work, it offers valuable information concerning recent Eastern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, also authorities and literature useful to the historian of liturgy and creeds. . . . His arduous and disinterested toil will be rewarded by the general gratitude, and his work will long prove useful not only to every theologian 'utriusque', but also 'cuiusque ecclesiae'". The Roumanian Academy at <a href="../cathen/03045a.htm">Bucharest</a> awarded a prize to this work. Soon after the appearance of the second edition of the "Kalendarium", the Russian Holy Synod issued from the synodal printing office at <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> a "Festbilderatlas" intended to a certain extent as the official Orthodox illustrations for the work. Nilles was not only a distinguished <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> professor, but also a meritorious director of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students. For fifteen years (1860-75) he presided over the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of Innsbruck, an international institution where young men from all parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> are trained for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.
