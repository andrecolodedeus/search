<h1>Nikolaus von Dinkelsb&uuml;hl</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a>, b. c. 1360, at Dinkelsb&uuml;hl; d. 17 March, 1433, at Mariazell in <a href="../cathen/14318a.htm">Styria</a>. He studied at the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a> where he is mentioned as <em>baccalaureus</em> in the <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">faculty of Arts</a> in 1385. Magister in 1390, he lectured in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, mathematics, and physics until 1397, and from 1402 to 1405. From 1397 he was dean of the faculty; he studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, lecturing until 1402 on <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> subjects, first as <em>cursor biblicus</em>, and later on the "Sentences" of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>. In 1405 he became bachelor of Divinity, in 1408 licentiate, and in 1409 doctor and member of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty. Rector of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, 1405-6, he declined the honor of a re-election in 1409. From 1405 he was also canon at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Stephen. The supposition of several early authors that he was a member of the Order of the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Hermits of St. Augustine</a> is incorrect, for he could not have been <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> had he been a member of any order. Eminent as teacher and <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator, Nikolaus possessed great business acumen, and was frequently chosen as ambassador both by the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and the reigning prince. He represented Duke Albert V of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> (1414-18), and the <a href="../cathen/15421a.htm">University of Vienna</a> in the trial of Thiem, dean of the Passau <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. When Emperor Sigismund came to <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, Nikolaus delivered an address on the abolition of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> ("Sermo de unione Ecclesiae in Concilium Constantiense," II, 7, Frankfort, 1697, 182-7). He took part in the election of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, and delivered an address to the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (Sommerfeldt, "Historisches Jahrbuch", XXVI, 1905, 323-7). Together with John, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, he was charged with the examination of witnesses in the proceedings against Hieronymus of Prague. Returning to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1418, he again took up his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as teacher at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and in 1423 directed the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> promotions as representative of the chancellor. Duke Albert V having chosen him as his confessor in 1425, wished to make him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a>, but Nikolaus declined the appointment. During the preparations for the Council of Basle, he was one of the committee to draw up the reform proposals which were to be presented to the council. His name does not appear thereafter in the records of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>.

<p>His published works include "Postilla cum sermonibus evangeliorum dominicalium" (Strasburg, 1496), and a collection of "Sermones" with tracts (Strasburg, 1516). Among his numerous unpublished works, the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of which are chiefly kept in the Court <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and in the Court and State <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, are to be mentioned his commentaries on the Psalms, Isaias, the Gospel of St. Matthew, some of the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, the "Sentences" of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, and "Questiones Sententiarum"; a commentary on the "Physics" of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, numerous sermons, lectures, moral and ascetic tracts.
