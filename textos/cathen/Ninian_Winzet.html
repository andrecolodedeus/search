<h1>Ninian Winzet</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and controversial writer, b. at Renfrew, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, 1518; d. at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, 21 Sept., 1592. Educated (probably, though not certainly) at <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a> University, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1540, and about 1551 became master of Linlithgow grammar <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and a little later <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the collegiate <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Michael. When <a href="../cathen/08680a.htm">John Knox's</a>  "rascal multitude" was devastating the churches of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> in 1559, Winzet is said by <a href="../cathen/09191b.htm">Bishop Leslie</a> to have publicly disputed with <a href="../cathen/08680a.htm">Knox</a> at Linlithgow. After the change of religion in 1560 he was, with other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and teachers who refused to conform to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, ejected from his office. On <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary's</a> arrival in Edinburgh he went thither, at once threw himself into combat against the new doctrines, and published in 1562 his most famous work, "Certane Tractatis" &#151; the first addressed to the queen, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and nobles, the second to <a href="../cathen/08680a.htm">Knox</a>, and the third to the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> and magistrates of <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>. Their ability and erudition made an immediate impression. Winzet, who seems for a time to have been Mary's confessor, was just bringing out his "Last Blast of the Trompet of Godis Worde", when it was stopped by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a>, and the author fled from <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, reaching <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in Sept., 1562. Here he wrote a preface to his "Buke of Four Scoir Thre Questions" (collected from his earlier polemical writings in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>), which was published at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> in Oct., 1563, with a postscript addressed to <a href="../cathen/08680a.htm">Knox</a>; and a little later his translation of the "Commonitorium" of Vincent of L&eacute;rins, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a>, also appeared at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>. From 1565 to 1570 Winzet resided in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, prosecuting his studies at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and apparently doing tutorial work also, as well as acting for a time as proctor for the "natio Anglicana seu Germanica".

<p>In 1571 he was attached by <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a>, then a captive in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, to the service of <a href="../cathen/09191b.htm">Bishop Leslie</a>, her ambassador in London; but on <a href="../cathen/09191b.htm">Leslie's</a> committal to the Tower Winzet returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and stayed for a time at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>. From 1575 to 1577 he was in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in June, 1577, <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of St. James's Scots <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, dispensing him from the regular year's <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. He received the abbatial blessing in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> from <a href="../cathen/06631b.htm">Goldwell</a>, the exiled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01766a.htm">St. Asaph</a>, at once entered on his new <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, and succeeded by his energy and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in repairing the shattered fortunes of St. James's, which had suffered greatly in the upheaval of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. By his wise administration and efforts in the cause of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> he won the favour and regard both of the Emperor Rudolph VI and of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. During his fifteen years' tenure of the abbacy he continued his literary labours, publishing his "Flagellum Sectariorum" and "Velitatio in Georgium Buchananum" in 1581, as well as other works, some of then now lost. He died at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, and was buried in the sanctuary of St. James's Church, where a monument with a eulogistic Latin epitaph marks his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">grave</a>.
