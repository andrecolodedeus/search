<h1>Nisibis</h1>  

<p>A titular Archdiocese of Mesopotamia, situated on the Mygdonius at the foot of Mt. Masius. It is so old that its original name is unknown. In any case it is not the Achad (Accad) of Genesis, x, 10, as has been asserted. When the Greeks came to Mesopotamia with Alexander they called it Antiochia Mygdonia, under which name it appears for the first time on the occasion of the march of Antiochus against the Molon (Polybius, V, 51). Subsequently the subject of constant disputes between the Romans and the Parthians, it was captured by Lucullus after a long siege from the brother of Tigranes (Dion Cassius, xxxv, 6, 7); and by <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> in 115, which won for him the name of Parthicus (ibid., LXVIII, 23). Recaptured by the Osrhoenians in 194, it was again conquered by <a href="../cathen/13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a> who made it his headquarters and established a colony there (ibid., LXXV, 23). In 297, by the treaty with Narses, the province of Nisibis was acquired by the Roman Empire; in 363 it was ceded to the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> on the defeat of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a>. The See of Nisibis was founded in 300 by Babu (died 309). His successor, the celebrated St. James, defended the city by his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> during the siege of Sapor II. At the time of its cession to the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, Nisibis was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> centre important enough to become the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of the Province of Beit-Arbaye. In 410 it had six suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> and as early as the middle of the fifth century was the most important <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> of the Persian Church after Seleucia-Ctesiphon. A great many of its <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> or Jacobite titulars are mentioned in Chabot ("Synodicon orientale", Paris, 1902, 678) and <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> (Oriens christ., II, 995, 1195-1204) and several of them, e.g. Barsumas, Osee, Narses, Jesusyab, Ebed-Jesus, etc., acquired deserved celebrity in the world of letters. Near Nisibis on 25 June, 1839, Ibrahim Pasha, son of Mehemet Ali, Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, won a great victory over the troops of Mahmud II. Today Nezib is a town of 3000 inhabitants in the sandjak of Orfa and the vilayet of <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Aleppo</a>. Its oil is considered very fine.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Nisibis, founded at the introduction of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> into the town, was closed when the province was ceded to the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, great <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. <a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">St. Ephraem</a> reestablished it on Roman soil at <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, whither flocked all the studious youth of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. In the fifth century the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> became a centre of Nestoriarnem. Archbishop Cyrus in 489 closed it and expelled masters and pupils, who withdrew to Nisibis. They were welcomed by Barsumas, a former pupil of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was at once re-opened at Nisibis under the direction of Narses, called the harp of the Holy Ghost. The latter dictated the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Those which have been discovered and published belong to Osee, the successor of Barsumas in the See of Nisibis, and bear the date 496; they must be substantially the same as those of 489. In 590 they were again modified. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, a sort of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, was established in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and directed by a superior called <em>Rabban</em>, a title also given to the instructors. The administration was confided to a majordomo, who was steward, prefect of discipline, and librarian, but under the supervision of a council. Unlike the Jacobite <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, devoted chiefly to profane studies, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Nisibis was above all a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The two chief masters were the instructors in reading and in the interpretation of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, explained chiefly with the aid of <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>. The course of studies lasted three years and was entirely gratuitous; but the students provided for their own support. During their sojourn at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, masters and students led a monastic life under somewhat special conditions. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> had a tribunal and enjoyed a civil <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, being able to acquire and possess all sorts of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Its rich <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> possessed a most beautiful collection of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> works; from its remains Ebed-Jesus, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Nisibis in the fourteenth century, composed his celebrated catalogue of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers. The disorders and dissensions, which arose in the sixth century in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Nisibis, favoured the development of its rivals, especially that of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a>; however, it did not really begin to decline until after the foundation of the School of <a href="../cathen/02202c.htm">Bagdad</a> (832). Among its literary celebrities mention should be made of its founder Narses; Abraham, his nephew and successor; Abraham of Kashgar, the restorer of monastic life; John; Babai the Elder; three <em>catholicoi</em> named Jesusyab.
