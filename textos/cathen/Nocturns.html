<h1>Nocturns</h1>  

<p>(<em>Nocturni</em> or <em>Nocturna</em>).

<p>A very old term applied to night Offices. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> speaks of nocturnal gatherings (Ad. Uxor., II, iv); <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, of the nocturnal hours, "nulla sint horis nocturnis precum damna, nulla orationum pigra et ignava dispendia" (De orat., xxix). In the life of Melania the Younger is found the expression "nocturn&aelig; hor&aelig;", "nocturna tempora" (Anal. Bolland., VIII, 1889, pp. 49 sq.). In these passages the term signifies night <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in general and seems synonymous with the word <em>vigili&aelig;</em>. It is not accurate, then, to assume that the present division of <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> into three Nocturns represents three distinct Offices recited during the night in the early ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Durandus of <a href="../cathen/10180a.htm">Mende</a> (Rationale, III, n. 17) and others who follow him assert that the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> rose thrice in the night to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; hence the present division into three Nocturns (cf. Beleth, Rupert, and other authors cited in the bibliography). Some <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">early Christian writers</a> speak of three vigils in the night, as Methodius or <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Methodius, "Symposion", V, ii, in P.G., XVIII, 100); but the first was evening <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> at nightfall, corresponding practically to our <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> of Complines; the second, midnight <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, specifically called Vigil; the third, a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> at dawn, corresponding to the Office of <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>. As a matter of fact the Office of the Vigils, and consequently of the Nocturns, was a single Office, recited without interruption at midnight. All the old texts alluding to this Office (see <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">M<font size=-2>ATINS</font></a>, V<font size=-2>IGIL</font>) testify to this. Moreover, it does not seem practical to assume that anyone, considering the length of the Office in those days, could have risen to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> at three different times during the night, besides joining in the two Offices of eventide and dawn.

<p>It was during the second period, probably in the fourth century, that to break the monotony of this long night <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> the custom of dividing it into three parts was introduced. Cassian in speaking of the solemn Vigils mentions three divisions of this Office (De c&oelig;nob. instit., III, viii, in P.L., XLIX, 144). We have here, we think, the origin of the Nocturns; or at least it is the earliest mention of them we possess. In the "Peregrinatio ad loca sancta", the Office of the Vigils, either for week-days or for <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, is an uninterrupted one, and shows no evidence of any division (cf. Cabrol, "Etude sur La Peregrinatio Sylvi&aelig;", Paris, 1895, pp. 37 and 53). A little later St. Benedict speaks with greater detail of this division of the Vigils into two Nocturns for ordinary days, and three for <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feast-days with six psalms and lessons for the first two Nocturns, three canticles and lessons for the third; this is exactly the structure of the Nocturns in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Office today, and practically in the Roman Office (Regula, ix, x, xi). The very expression "Nocturn", to signify the night Office, is used by him twice (xv, xvi). He also uses the term <em>Nocturna laus</em> in speaking of the Office of the Vigils. The <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> which E. Warren tries to draw from the "Antiphonary of Bangor" to show that in the Celtic Church, according to a <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> older than the Benedictino-Roman practice, there were three separate Nocturns of Vigils, is based on a confusion of the three Offices, "Initium noctis", "Nocturna", and "Matutina", which are not the three Nocturns, but the Office of Eventide, of the Vigil, and of <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a> (cf. The Tablet, 16 Dec., 1893, p. 972; and B&#228;umer-Biron, <em>infra,</em> I, 263, 264).

<p>The division of the Vigils into two or three Nocturns in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> dates back at least to the fifth century. We may conjecture that St. Benedict, who, in the composition of the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <em>cursus,</em> follows the arrangement of the Roman Office so closely, must have been inspired equally by the Roman customs in the composition of his Office. Whatever <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> there may be as to priority, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the Roman system bears a strong <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogy</a> to that of the Nocturns in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Office even at the present <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, and the differences subsisting are almost entirely the result of transformations or additions, which the Roman Office has been subjected to in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. On <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feast-days there are three Nocturns, as in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Office. Each Nocturn comprises three <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">psalms</a>, and the first Nocturn of <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> has three groups of four <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">psalms</a> each. The <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferial days</a> have only one Nocturn consisting of twelve <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">psalms</a>; each Nocturn has, as usual, three lessons. For the variations which have occurred in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> in the composition of the Nocturns, and for the different usages see <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">M<font size=-2>ATINS</font></a>. These different usages are recorded by Dom Mart&eacute;ne. For the terms, "Nocturnales Libri", "Nocturn&aelig;", see <a href="../cathen/05181b.htm">Du Cange</a>, "Glossarium infim&aelig; latinitatis", s.vv.
