<h1>Nola</h1>  

<p>(NOLANA)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a>; suffragan of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. The city of Nola in the Italian Province of <a href="../cathen/03399a.htm">Caserta</a>, in Campania, is said to have been founded by the Etruscans or by Chalcideans from Cumae. On the most ancient <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> it is called Nuvlana. In the Samnite War (311 B.C.) the town was taken by the Romans, in the Punic War it was twice besieged by Hannibal (215 and 214), and on both occasions splendidly defended by Marcellus. In the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Marsi, the latter took Nola, in 90 B.C., but, notwithstanding their brilliant defense of the city, it was retaken from them in the year 89, and its recapture put an end to that <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The city was sacked by Spartacus, for which reason <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> and <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> sent colonies there. In A.D. 410 it was sacked by Alaric, in 453 by the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, in 806 and again in 904 by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. From the time of Charles I of Anjou to the middle of the fifteenth century, Nola was a <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> possession of the Orsini. The battle of Nola (1459) is famous for the clever stratagem by which John of Anjou defeated Alfonso of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. Nola furnished a considerable portion of the antiquities in the museum of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, especially beautiful Greek vases. In the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> there is a collection of ancient inscriptions, among which are some Oscan tablets. The ruins of an amphitheatre and other ancient remains are yet to be seen in this city, where the <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Emperor Augustus</a>, who died there, had a famous temple. Nola was the birthplace of <a href="../cathen/03016a.htm">Giordano Bruno</a>, of Luigi Tausillo, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and poet, of the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> Giovanni Merliano, whose work is well represented in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and of the physician Ambrogio Leo.

<p>The ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> memories of Nola are connected with the neighboring Cimitile, the name of which recalls the site of an ancient cemetery. There is the basilica of St. Felix, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, built, and poetically described by St. Paulinus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city, who shows that no sanctuary, after the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, was visited by as many <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> as came to this shrine. St. Felix, who lived between the middle of the second century and the middle of the third, was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nola. The city has several other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, among them, Sts. Reparatus, Faustillus, and Acacius, companions of <a href="../cathen/08295a.htm">St. Januarius</a>, besides St. Felix, confessor. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Nola were St. Marinus (about the year 300); St. Priscus, who died in 328 or, according to Mommsen, in 523; St. Quodvultdeus, who died in 387 and was succeeded by St. Paulinus. The body of the last-named saint was taken to <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> in 839, and in the year 1000 was given to Otho III by the people of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> in exchange for the body of St. Bartholomew; in 1909 it was restored to Nola. In the fifth century the archpresbyter St. Adeodatus flourished at Nola; his metrical epitaph has been preserved. In 484 Joannes Taloias, Orthodox <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, having been driven from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nola. It was St. Paulinus III (c. 505) who became a slave to free a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> son; this heroic deed was afterwards attributed to St. Paulinus I. Bishop Lupicinus (786) restored several sacred buildings. Francis Scacciani (1370) erected the Gothic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which was finished by Bishop Gian Antonio Boccarelli (1469). Antonio Scarampi (1549) founded the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and introduced the reforms of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. Fabrizio Gallo (1585) founded several <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>; G. B. Lancellotti (1615-56), who was <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Apostolic nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> from 1622 to 1627, did much for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; Francis M. Carafa (1704), a <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine</a>, was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; Traiano Caracciolo (1738) constructed the new <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>; has 86 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with 200,000 inhabitants, 9 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men, and 19 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, several <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> and asylums, and four monthly and bi-monthly periodicals.
