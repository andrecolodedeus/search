<h1>Nomination</h1>  

<p>The various methods of designating <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> for <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> or offices have been described under B<font size=-2>ENEFICE</font>; <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">B<font size=-2>ISHOP</font></a>; <a href="../cathen/05374b.htm">E<font size=-2>LECTION</font></a>; <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">C<font size=-2>ANONICAL</font> I<font size=-2>NSTITUTION</font></a>. All these methods are more or less included in the ordinary sense of the term <em>nomination;</em> but in its strict canonical sense, nomination is defined as the designation of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> for an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> or office made by the competent <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> and conferring on the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> named the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to be canonically instituted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior. It follows the rules of patronal presentation, being based on the same grounds as the right of patronage, viz., the endowment of churches or <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> by kings, princes, or communities. Its method of action is designed to keep the prerogatives of the two powers clearly separated, the intervention of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> taking effect in the free choice of a fit <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> being reserved intact to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior, who alone can give <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a>. At the present time appointments to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> by right of nomination, especially to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, is generally settled by negotiation and previous understanding between the two powers. Under the old regime the nominated <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> himself applied for <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a>; the superior made inquiry as to the applicant and, unless the inquiry disclosed unworthiness or unfitness, granted <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a> according to the customary forms&mdash;most often by consistorial <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconization</a>. Whatever procedure may be followed, the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> named by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> has no <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> until he has been canonically instituted; and if he should dare to intrude in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> with no other title than his nomination by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authority</a>, not only would all his acts be null and void, but he, and with him those who should have consented to his acts, would incur <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and other penalties; moreover, he would forfeit the right resulting from his nomination (Const. "Romanus pontifex", 28 Aug., 1873, and the texts there cited. Cf. <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">E<font size=-2>XCOMMUNICATION</font></a>, vol. V, p. 691, col. 1).

<p>The most important application of the right of nomination by princes is, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, that which relates to the major or consistorial, <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, especially <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>. Without going back to the intrusions of royal power in episcopal elections in the barbarian kingdoms, or in the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> Empire, or the Byzantine, it must be remembered that the Concordat of Worms (1121), which ended the <a href="../cathen/08084c.htm">Conflict of Investitures</a>, included an initial measure for the separation of the parts and prerogatives of the two powers in the choice of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The emperor recognized the freedom of episcopal elections and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrations</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, on his side, agreed that elections should be held in the emperor's presence, without <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> or restraint, that the emperor should decide in case of dispute, that he should give temporal investiture, by the sceptre, to the bishop-elect, while investiture by ring and <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>, symbolic of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>, should be combined with the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. The custom of election of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by chapters, which was the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> of the thirteenth century, left, officially, no opening for royal interference, but princes none the less endeavoured to have their candidates elected. This became more difficult for them when, by successive reservations, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had made themselves masters of all episcopal elections, thus occasioning serious inconveniences. While in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the Concordat of 1448 re-established capitular elections, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, on the contrary, after the difficulties consequent upon the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> (1438), the quarrel ended with the Concordat of 1516. In this instrument we find the right of nomination guaranteed to the kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for consistorial <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, abbacies, and priorates; and thence the arrangement passed into most of the subsequent <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordats</a>, including that of 1801 (cf. Nussi, "Quinquaginta conventiones", Rome, 1869, tit. v). The royal ordinance of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgating</a> the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> says: "Such vacancy occurring, the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> shall be bound to present and name [the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> says only <em>nobis nominabit</em>] a master &hellip; and otherwise fit, within six months &hellip; that we may appoint his nominee to the vacant see." If this <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is rejected, the king will nominate another within three months; if not, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> can himself appoint. The same right of nomination is extended to abbacies and priorates, with some exceptions. The <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a> (articles 4 and 5) accords to the First Consul the same right of nomination, but only for <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, and without fixing a limit of time for its exercise. In other countries (e.g. <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>) the right of the temporal ruler includes other <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> besides <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>.

<p>Such being the nature of the very definite right of nomination, nothing but malicious provocation can be discerned in the conflict brought on by M. Combes, when Prime Minister of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1902-5), in regard to the <em>nobis nominavit,</em> the expression which figured in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. By a note <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 21 Dec., 1902, the French Government demanded the suppression of the <em>nobis,</em> as if to make it appear that the head of the State nominated <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> absolutely, like government officials. The Vatican explained the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature of the nomination as the designation of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> by the head of the State, the latter indicating to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the cleric whom he desires as head of such a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> accordingly creating that candidate <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by <a href="../cathen/08065a.htm">canonical institution</a>. The fact was pointed out that the word <em>nobis</em> is found in the episcopal <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of all nations which have by concordat the right of nomination; also that, with very rare exceptions, it appears in all the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> under the Concordat of 1516 as under that of 1801; that previously, in 1871, the French Government having obtained without any difficulty the suppression of the word <em>pr&aelig;sentavit,</em> had, upon representations made by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, withdrawn its demand for the suppression of the <em>nobis;</em> above all, it was insisted on that the letters patent of the French Government to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had from time immemorial contained the words: "We name him [the candidate] and present him to Your Holiness, that it may please Your Holiness, upon our nomination and presentation, to provide for the said bishopric", etc. The Vatican nevertheless declared that it did not desire to refuse any satisfactory revision; various formul&aelig; were proposed on either side, without success; at last the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> consented to suppress the word <em>nobis</em> employing the usual formula in drafting letters patent. (On this conflict see the "Livre Blanc du Saint Si&#232;ge"; vi, in "Acta S. Sedis", 15 Jan., 1906.) This concession, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, did not delay the separation which the French Government was determined to have at any price.
