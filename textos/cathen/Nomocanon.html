<h1>Nomocanon</h1>  

<p>(From the Greek <em>nomos</em>, law, and <em>kanon</em>, a rule)

<p>A collection of ecclesiastical law, the elements of which are borrowed from secular and canon law. When we recall the important place given to <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> in the imperial <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> such as the Theodosian Code, the Justinian collections, and the subsequent "Novell&aelig;", and "Basilica", the utility of comparing <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and canons relating to the same subjects will be readily recognized. Collections of this kind are found only in Eastern law. The <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> has two principal collections. The first, dating from the end of the sixth century, is ascribed, though without <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, to John Scholasticus, whose canons it utilizes and completes. He had drawn up (about 550) a purely canonical compilation in fifty titles, and later composed an extract from the "Novell&aelig;" in eighty-seven chapters (for the canonical collection see Voellus and Justellus, "Bibliotheca juris canonici", Paris, 1661, II, 449 sqq.; for the eighty-seven chapters, Pitra, "Juris ecclesiastici Gr&aelig;corum historia et monumenta", Rome, 1864, II, 385). To each of the fifty titles were added the texts of the imperial <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> on the same subject, with twenty-one additional chapters nearly all borrowed from John's eighty-seven (Voellus and Justellus, op. cit., II, 603). In its earliest form this collection dates from the reign of Emperor Heraclius (610-40), at which time Latin was replaced by Greek as the official language of the imperial <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Its two sections include the <a href="../cathen/03287a.htm">ecclesiastical canons</a> and the imperial <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> the latter in fourteen titles.

<p>This collection was long held in esteem and passed into the Russian Church, but was by degrees supplanted by that of Photius. The first part of Photius's collection contains the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> canons and the decisions of the Fathers. It is in substance the Greek collection of 692, as it is described by canon ii of the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Trullan Council</a> (see <a href="../cathen/09056a.htm">CANON LAW</a>), with the addition of 102 canons of that council, 17 canons of the Council of Constantinople of 861 (against Ignatius), and of 3 canons substituted by Photius for those of the &oelig;cumenical council of 869. The nomocanon in fourteen titles was completed by additions from the more recent imperial <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. This whole collection was commentated about 1170 by <a href="../cathen/02226b.htm">Theodore Balsamon</a>, Greek <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> residing at Constantinople (Nomocanon with <a href="../cathen/02226b.htm">Balsamon's</a> commentary in Voellus and Justellus, II, 815; P.G., CIV, 441). Supplemented by this commentary the collection of Photius has become a part of the "Pidalion" (<em>pedalion</em>, rudder), a sort of <em>Corpus Juris</em> of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, printed in 1800 by Patriarch Neophytus VIII. In the eleventh century it had been also translated into Slavonic for the Russian Church; it is retained in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> of Greece, and included in the "Syntagma" published by Rhallis and Potlis (Athens, 1852-9). Though called the "Syntagma", the collection of ecclesiastical law of <a href="../cathen/02596a.htm">Matthew Blastares</a> (c. 1339) is a real nomocanon, in which the texts of the canons and of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are arranged in alphabetical order (P.G., loc. cit.; Beveridge, "Synodicon", Oxford, 1672). A remarkable nomocanon was composed by John Barhebr&aelig;us (1226-86) for the Syrian Church of Antioch (Latin version by Assemani in <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Mai</a>, "Script. vet, nova collectio", X, 3 sqq.). Several Russian manuals published at Kiev and <a href="../cathen/10591b.htm">Moscow</a> in the seventeenth century were also nomocanons.
