<h1>Non Expedit</h1>  

<p>("It is not expedient").

<p>Words with which the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> enjoined upon <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> the policy of abstention from the polls in parliamentary elections. This policy was adopted after a period of uncertainty and of controversy which followed the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the Constitution of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a> (1861), and which was intensified by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> hostile to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and, especially, to the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders (1865-66). To this uncertainty the Holy Penitentiary put an end by its <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 29 February, 1868, in which, in the above words, it sanctioned the motto; "Neither elector nor elected". Until then there had been in the Italian Parliament a few eminent representatives of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests&mdash;Vito d'Ondes Reggio, Augusto Conti, Cesare Cant&#249;, and others. The principal motive of this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was that the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> taken by deputies might be interpreted as an approval of the spoliation of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> declared in an audience of 11 October, 1874. A practical reason for it, also, was that, in view of the electoral law of that day, by which the electorate was reduced to 650,000, and as the Government manipulated the elections to suit its own purposes, it would have been hopeless to attempt to prevent the passage of anti-Catholic <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. On the other hand, the masses seemed unprepared for parliamentary government, and as, in the greater portion of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (Parma, <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>), nearly all sincere <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were partizans of the dispossessed princes, they were liable to be denounced as enemies of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; they would also have been at variance with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> and of the provinces wrested from <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and this division would have further weakened the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Parliamentary group.

<p>As might be expected, this measure did not meet with universal approval; the so-called Moderates accused the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of failing in their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and to their country. In 1882, the suffrage having been extended, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> took into serious consideration the partial abolition of the restrictions established by the <em>Non Expedit,</em> but nothing was actually done (cf. "Archiv f&uuml;r kathol. Kirchenrecht", 1904, p. 396). On the contrary, as many people came to the conclusion that the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> <em>Non Expedit</em> was not intended to be absolute, but was only an admonition made to apply upon one particular occasion, the Holy Office declared (30 Dec., 1886) that the rule in question implied a grave precept, and emphasis was given to this fact on several subsequent occasions (Letter of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> to the Cardinal Secretary of State, 14 May, 1895; Congregation of Extraordinary Affairs, 27 January, 1902; <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, <em>Motu proprio,</em> 18 Dec., 1903). Later <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, by his encyclical "Il fermo proposito" (11 June, 1905) modified the <em>Non Expedit,</em> declaring that, when there was question of preventing the election of a "subversive" candidate, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> could ask for a suspension of the rule, and invite the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to hold themselves in readiness to go to the polls. (See <a href="../cathen/09657c.htm">M<font size=-2>ARGOTTI,</font> G<font size=-2>IACOMO</font></a>).
