<h1>Northampton</h1>  

<p>(NORTANTONIENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, comprises the Counties of Northampton, Bedford, Buckingham, Cambridge, Huntingdon, Norfolk, and Suffolk, mainly composed of agricultural districts and fenlands, where <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are comparatively few (see, in article ENGLAND, <em>Map of the Ecclesiastical Province of Westminster</em>). The number of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> is 70, of regular 18, of <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and stations, 73, and of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 13,308 (1910). Among the more important <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders are the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> the most notable are those of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> at East Bergholt, the Sisters of Notre Dame at Northampton and Norwich, the Sisters of Jesus and Mary at Ipswich, the Poor Sisters of Nazareth at Northampton, and the Dames <a href="../cathen/02507a.htm">Bernardines</a> at Slough, who at their own expense built a fine church for that <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. The principal towns are <a href="../cathen/11121a.htm">Norwich</a>, Ipswich, and Cambridge, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> town where, according to tradition <a href="../cathen/13800a.htm">St. Simon Stock</a>, of the Order of Carmel, received the brown <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> from <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>. The Decorated Gothic <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>, one of the most beautiful in the kingdom (<a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1890), is dedicated to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English Martyrs</a>. It is the gift of Mrs. Lyne Stephens of Lynford Hall, Norfolk. Norwich possesses one of the grandest <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, built by the munificence of the present Duke of Norfolk in the Transitional Norman style, after the designs of Sir Gilbert Scott, and completed in 1910. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Northampton is a commodious but unpretentious building designed by the younger <a href="../cathen/12558b.htm">Pugin</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Northampton, William Wareing, had been <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Eastern District before the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>; he resigned the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1858, and died in 1865. His successor, <a href="../cathen/01428a.htm">Francis Kerril Amherst</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 4 July, 1858, and resigned in 1879, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> being occupied the following year by Arthur Riddell, who d.15 Sept., 1907. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Northampton (1910), Frederick William Keating, b. at <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, 13 June, 1859, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 25 Feb., 1908.

<p>Northampton was the scene of the last stand made by <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas of Canterbury</a> against the arbitrary conduct of Henry II. <a href="../cathen/03085a.htm">Bury St. Edmund's</a>, anciently so renowned as the place where the body of St. Edmund, King and Martyr, was enshrined and <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as well as for its <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, has become familiar to the modern reader mainly through Carlyle's "Past and Present," in the pages of which Abbot Samson (1135-1211), the hero of Jocelin's Chronicle, occupies the central position. The Isle of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a> and <a href="../cathen/05554b.htm">St. Etheldreda</a> are famous in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>. Canute, Kine of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, was accustomed to row or skate across the fens each year to be present on the Feast of the Purification at the Mass in the Abbey Church of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>, and Thomas Eliensis ascribes to him the well-known lines beginning, "Sweetly sang the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a>". At Walsingham, also in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, only ruins are now left of a shrine which, in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, was second only to the Holy House of Loreto, of which it was a copy. Many great names of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> period are connected with the district covered by the Diocese of Northampton. Catherine of Aragon died at Kimbolton and was buried at <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Peterborough</a>, where the short inscription, "Queen Catherine", upon a stone slab marks her resting-place. From Framlingham Castle, the ruins of which are still considerable, <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary Tudor</a> set out, on the death of Edward VI, to contest with Lady Jane Grey her right to the throne. At Ipswich, the birthplace of <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Cardinal Wolsey</a>, is still to be seen the gateway of the College built by him. At Fotheringay, <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Queen of Scots</a> was beheaded (1587), and at Wisbech Castle, where so many missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, during penal times, were <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, William Watson, the last but one of the <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Marian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, died, a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> for the Faith (1584). <a href="../cathen/02386d.htm">Sir Henry Bedingfeld</a>, the faithful follower of <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a> and the gentle "Jailor of the Princess Elizabeth", is associated with this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> through Oxburgh Hall, his mansion still occupied by another Sir Henry Bedingfeld, his direct descendant. The Pastons of Paston are memorable in connection with the celebrated "Paston Letters". Many of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who suffered death under the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> belonged to the districts now included in the Diocese of Northampton, in particular, <a href="../cathen/07169a.htm">Henry Heath</a>, born, 1600, at <a href="../cathen/11756b.htm">Peterborough</a>; <a href="../cathen/15540a.htm">Venerable Henry Walpole, S.J.</a>, (d. 1595), a native of Norfolk, and <a href="../cathen/14164a.htm">Venerable Robert Southwell S.J.</a>, (1560-95), the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> poet, also born in Norfolk. In more recent times <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Bishop Milner</a> was connected with the preservation of the Faith in this part of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Alban Butler, the hagiographer, was born in Northamptonshire and was resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/11121a.htm">Norwich</a> from 1754-56. <a href="../cathen/07589a.htm">Dr. Husenbeth</a> resided for some years at Cossey, where he is buried. <a href="../cathen/14214b.htm">Father Ignatius Spencer</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionist</a>, son of Earl Spencer, and formerly Rector of Brington, was received into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at Northampton, and Faber, the Oratorian, held the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">living</a> of Elton, Huntingdonshire, before his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>.
