<h1>Northern Kiang-si</h1>  

<p>(Vicariate Apostolic)

<p><a href="../cathen/13034a.htm">Father Matteo Ricci</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> was the first missionary who entered the province of Kiang-si at the end of the sixteenth century. It was during his voyage from Canton to the capital of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> that he remained for some time in this province, and preached the Gospel with success. After him, during the seventeenth century, some missionaries belonging to different <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders came. <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> organized this province into a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a>, and entrusted it to Rev. Fr. Alvares Benavento of the Augustinian order, appointing him <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a>. The new vicar fixed his residence in Kan-chou-fu. During his administration, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit fathers</a> built beautiful churches and founded flourishing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities at Yao-chou, Kin-kiang, and Nan-change, capital of the province. Bishop Benavento died at <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a>, 1705. He was not replaced on account of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. The mission was entrusted to Bishop Ventallot, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Fu-kien. The <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> of Fu-kien maintained the mission of Kiang-si under their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> until the appointment of Bishop Carpena, who obtained in 1838 that the missions of Kiang-si and Che-kiang be removed from his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and transferred to the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers. In 1722 we find Father Entrecolles, S.J., at King-te-chen, whence he sent a magnificent study on the art of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> moulding. In 1785 the first <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> missionaries arrived at Peking to take the place of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries. They were charged with the missions of Kiang-si and Kiang-nan. Unable to get themselves into those missions on account of the persecutions of Youn-ching and Kien-long, they delegated the native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to visit the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. In 1790, Blessed Clet was sent to Kiang-si, where no <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> missionaries had set foot during the preceding forty years. He remained alone during three years. The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> broke out again during the reign of Kia-king. Blessed Clet, assisted by the <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, administered during this time the missions confided to the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers. He was arrested in Ho-nan in 1819, and on 18 Feb., 1820, suffered death by strangulation at the age of seventy-two. In 1832, Father Laribe arrived in Kiang-si.

<p>In 1838, at the request of Bishop Carpena, Kiang-si and Che-kiang were separated from the Vicariate Apostolic of Fu-kien. Bishop Rameaux, former missionary of Hu-pe, was named <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of the new vicariate formed by the union of Kiang-si and Che-kiang. At this time there were approximately 9000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Kiang-si. In 1845, Bishop Rameaux died of apoplexy. The mission of Che-kiang was separated from that of Kiang-si and Bishop Laribe was named <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of Kiang-si. From 1856 to 1860 the ravages of Changmau (Tai-ping) reduced the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to 6000. In 1870, at the arrival of Bishop Bray, there were 7388 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and more than 1050 <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>. There were then four <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> missionaries and ten native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. In 1879 <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> divided Kiang-si into the vicariates of Southern Kiang-si and Northern Kiang-si. Finally, in 1885, the Vicariate Apostolic of Eastern Kiang-si was separated from Northern Kiang-si. Bishop Paul Ferrant was named co-adjutor to Bishop Bray in 1898, and <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Barbalissus; he assumed the direction of the mission in 1905. In the succeeding years, the mission of Northern Kiang-si was the scene of bloody persecutions. Father Laruche and five <a href="../cathen/09749c.htm">Little Brothers of Mary</a> were massacred at Nan-chang on 25 Feb., 1906; the mission and the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> were burned. Three other missionaries and five Daughters of Charity saved their lives by fleeing to Kiu-kiang.

<p>The mission of Northern Kiang-si comprises today (1910) the six following civil prefectures: Kiu-kiang-fu, residence of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, Yoci-chou-fu, Nan-chang-fu, capital of the province, Nan-kang-fu, Lin-kiang-fu, and Yuan-chou-fu. It contains about ten million inhabitants. In 1899 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mission included: 2 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 11 <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, of whom 2 were Chinese, 2 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 14 Daughters of Charity, 1471 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Condition of the mission in 1907: 1 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 16 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> missionaries, 4 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 98 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, two <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> with 24 students, 50 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 1439 scholars, 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> directed by the <a href="../cathen/09749c.htm">Little Brothers of Mary</a>, 24 Daughters of Charity, 8395 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1908: 1 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, 18 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> missionaries, 4 native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 110 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, 11,397 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.
