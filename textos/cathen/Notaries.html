<h1>Notaries</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>notarius</em>).

<p>Persons appointed by competent authority to draw up official or authentic documents. These documents are issued chiefly from the official administrative bureaux, the <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">chanceries</a>; secondly, from tribunals; lastly, others are drawn up at the request of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> to authenticate their contracts or other acts. The public officials appointed to draw up these three classes of papers have been usually called notaries.

<p>Etymologically, a notary is one who takes notes. Notes are signs or cursory abbreviations to record the words uttered, so that they may be reproduced later in ordinary writing. Notaries were at first private secretaries, attached to the service of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in positions of importance. It was natural for the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of notes to be in high esteem among those employed in recording the transactions of public boards, and for the name notary to be applied to these officials; so that before long the word was used to signify their occupation.

<p>The title and office existed at the Imperial Court (cf. Cod. Theod., VI, 16, "De primicerio et notariis"), whence they passed into all the royal <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">chanceries</a>, though in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the term notary ceased to be used. This was the case also with the <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">chanceries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the great <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>, and even every <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. There are grounds for doubting whether the seven regional notaries of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, one for each <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> district of the Holy City, were instituted by St. Clement and appointed by him to record the <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts of the martyrs</a>, as is said in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> ("Vita Clementis", ed. Duchesne, I, 123); they date back, however, to an early age. Not only were there notaries as soon as a bureau for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> documents was established, but in very ancient days we find these notaries forming a kind of college presided over by a <em>primicerius</em>; the notice of <a href="../cathen/08561a.htm">Julius I</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> relates that this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ordered an account of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>, intended as an authentic document, to be drawn up before the <em>primicerius</em> of the notaries.

<p>The latter were in the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and must have received one of the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>; for the notariate is an office and not an order. At intervals the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> entrusted the notaries of their <em>curia</em> with various missions. Their chief, the <em>primicerius</em>, with whom a <em>secundicerius</em> is sometimes found later, was a very important personage, in fact, the head of the pontifical chancery; during the vacancy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chair, he formed part of the interim Government, and a letter in 640 (Jaff&eacute;, "Regesta", n. 2040) is signed (the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> being elected but not yet <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>) by one "Joannes primicerius et servans locum s. sedis apostolicae".

<p>There were of course many notaries in the service of the pontifical chancery; the seven regional notaries preserved a certain pre-eminence over the others and became the prothonotaries, whose name and office continued. The ordinary notaries of the chancery, however, were gradually known by other names, according to their various functions, so that the term ceased to be employed in the pontifical and other <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">chanceries</a>. The prothonotaries were and still are a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, enjoying numerous privileges; they are known as "participants", but outside of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> there are many purely honorary prothonotaries. The official <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> had insensibly almost ceased; but <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> in his reorganization of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> has appointed participant prothonotaries to the chancery (Const. "Sapienti", 29 June, 1908). A corresponding change occurred in the bureaux of the episcopal churches, <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, etc.; the officials attached to the chancery have ceased to be known as notaries and are called chancellor, secretary, etc. Lastly, mention must be made of the notaries of the synodal or <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> assemblies, whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> are limited to the duration of the assembly.

<p>Society in former times did not recognize the separation of powers; so, too, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the judicial authority was vested in the same <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> as the administrative. Soon, however, contentious matters were tried separately before a specially appointed body. The courts required a staff to record the transactions; these clerks were likewise notaries. In most civil courts they are, however, called registrars, clerks of the court, etc., but in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunals they retain the name notary, though they are also called actuaries. Thus the special <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the higher <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunals, the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a> and the Signatura, reorganized by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, provides for the appointment of notaries for these two tribunals (can. v and xxxv). The reason why the head official charged with drawing up the documents of the Holy Office is called the notary, as were the clerks who in former times drew up the records of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, is, doubtless, that of all the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a> the Holy Office is the only real judicial tribunal. The notaries of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunals are usually <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>; the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> may however be confided to <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, except in criminal cases against a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>.

<p>Finally, there is the class of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom the term notary is restricted in common parlance, to wit, those who are appointed by the proper authorities to witness the documentary proceedings between private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and to impress them with legal authenticity. They are not engaged in the <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">chanceries</a>, in order that they may be within easy reach of private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>; they have a public character, so that their records, drawn up according to rule, are received as authentic accounts of the particular transaction, especially agreements, contracts, testaments, and wills.

<p>Consequently, public notaries may be appointed only by those authorities who possess <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> <em>in foro externo</em>, and have a chancery, e.g. <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, emperors, reigning princes, and of course only within the limits of their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; moreover, the territory within which a notary can lawfully exercise his functions is expressly determined. There were formerly Apostolic notaries and even episcopal notaries, duly commissioned by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> or episcopal letters, whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it was to receive documents relating to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or mixed affairs, especially in connection with <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, foundations, and donations in favor of churches, wills of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, etc. They no longer exist; the only <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> notaries at present are the officials of the Roman and episcopal <em>curiae</em>. Moreover these notaries were <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, and Canon Law forbids <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to acts as scriveners (c. viii, "Ne clerici vel monachi", 1. III, tit. 50).
