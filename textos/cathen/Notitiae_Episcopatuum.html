<h1>Notitiae Episcopatuum</h1>  

<p>The name given to official documents that furnish for Eastern countries the list and hierarchical rank of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> of a Church. Whilst, in the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were classed according to the seniority of their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and in Africa according to their age, in the Eastern <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a> the hierarchical rank of each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was determined by the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> he occupied. Thus, in the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the first <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> was not the longest <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, but whoever happened to be the incumbent of the See of Caesarea; the second was the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Ephesus, and so on. In every <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>, the rank of each suffragan was thus determined, and remained unchanged unless the list was subsequently modified. The hierarchical order included first of all, the patriarch; then the greater <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, i.e., those who had <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> with suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>; the autocephalous <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, who had no suffragans, and were directly subject to the patriarch; next <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> who, although not differing from autocephalous <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, occupied hierarchical rank inferior to theirs, and were also immediately dependent on the patriarch; then simple <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, i.e., exempt <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and lastly suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. It is not known by whom this very ancient order was established, but it is likely that, in the beginning, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan sees</a> and simple <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> must have been classified according to the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of their respective foundations, this order being modified later on for political and religious considerations. We here append, Church by Church, the principal of these documents.

<p>A. Constantinople: The "Ecthesis of pseudo-Epiphanius", a revision of an earlier Notitia episcopatuum (probably compiled by Patriarch Epiphanius under Justinian), made during the reign of Heraclius (about 640); a Notitia dating back to the first years of the ninth century and differing but little from the earlier one; the "Notitia of Basil the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>" drawn up between 820 and 842; the Notitia compiled by Emperor Leo VI the Philosopher, and Patriarch Nicholas Mysticus between 901 and 907, modifying the hierarchical order which had been established in the seventh century, but had been disturbed by the incorporation of the ecclesiastical provinces of Illyricum and Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in the Byzantine Patriarchate; the Notitiae episcopatuum of Constantine Porphyrogenitus (about 940), of Tzimisces (about 980), of Alexius Comnenus (about 1084), of Nil Doxapatris (1143), of Manuel Comnenus (about 1170), of Isaac Angelus (end of twelfth century), of Michael VIII Palaeologus (about 1270), of Andronicus II Palaeologus (about 1299), and of Andronicus III (about 1330). All these Notitiae are published in Gelzer, "Ungedruckte und ungen&uuml;gend ver&ouml;ffentlichte Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum" (Munich, 1900); Gelzer, "Georgii Cyprii Descriptio orbis romani" (Leipzig, 1890); Gelzer, "Index lectionum Ienae" (Jena, 1892); Parthey, "Hieroclis Synecdemus" (Berlin, 1866). The later works are only more or less modified copies of the Notitia of Leo the Philosopher, and therefore do not present the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> situation, which was profoundly changed by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> invasions. After the capture of Constantinople by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, another Notitia was written, portraying the real situation (Gelzer "Ungedruckte Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum" 613-37), and on it are based nearly all those which have been since written. The term <em>Syntagmation</em> is now used by the Greeks for these documents.

<p>B. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of only one "Notitia episcopatuum" for the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a>, viz. that drawn up in the sixth century by Patriarch Anastasius (see Vailhe in "Echos d'Orient", X, pp. 90-101, 139-145, 363-8). <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> has no such document, nor has Alexandria, although for the latter Gelzer has collected documents which may help to supply the deficiency (Byz. Zeitschrift, II, 23-40). De Roug&eacute; (G&eacute;ographie ancienne de la Basse-Egypte, Paris, 1891, 151-61) has published a Coptic document which has not yet been studied. For the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> Church of <a href="../cathen/01103b.htm">Achrida</a>, see Gelzer, "Byz. Zeitschrift", II, 40 66, and "Der Patriarchat von Achrida" (Leipzig, 1902). M. Gerland has just announced for 1913 a critical and definitive new edition of all the Notitiae episcopatuum of the Churches of Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, <a href="../cathen/01103b.htm">Achrida</a>, Ipek, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and Georgia.
