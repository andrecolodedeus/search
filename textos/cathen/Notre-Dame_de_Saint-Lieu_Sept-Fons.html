<h1>Notre-Dame de Saint-Lieu Sept-Fons</h1>  

<p>Located in the <a href="../cathen/10603b.htm">Diocese of Moulins</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, it was founded (1132) by Guichard and Guillaume de Bourbon, of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> de Bourbon-Lancy, which gave kings to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; this gave rise to the name "Royal Abbey". Thanks to the liberality of the founders, and to the energy of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and community, the church was soon completed and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin; the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, with all the regular structures prescribed by the rule, was completed at the same time. After exhibiting generosity at the beginning, their founders and friends seem to have neglected them, for the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> found the burden of poverty so heavy, that they were even compelled to sell parts of the lands to supply the necessities of life. Until the Reform of 1663, the number of religious never exceeded 15. They were much encouraged, in their early days of trial, by a visit of St Bernard (1138). At first the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was only known under the name of "Notre-Dame de Saint-Lieu"; it was only after a century that "Sept-Fons" was added, derived either from seven fountains or from seven canals leading water to, the Abbey. <a href="../cathen/01156b.htm">Adrian III</a> took the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> under his protection in 1158; and <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> ratified the foundation by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> in 1164.

<p>After the middle of the fifteenth century the incessant <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> did not spare the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>; frequently the religious were forced to leave it and see it despoiled of its goods, and its buildings demolished. Inevitably, under such circumstances, relaxation entered the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In 1656 Eustache de Beaufort, at the age of 20 years, was made <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. For the first seven years there was no improvement; but after that time he resolved on a complete change. His religious &mdash; there were then but four&mdash;refusing to accept the new rule, were each granted a pension and dismissed. It was not long before a number of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> presented themselves for admission. They were sent to La Trappe, to make their <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> under the Abbot de Ranc&eacute;. Dom Eustache also visited the celebrated reformer for counsel and advice, in 1667. After this, with the royal aid, Sept-Fons was rebuilt on a grander scale, and prosperity continued until the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was confiscated at the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, 1791. In 1845, when the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> of the Abbaye du Gard were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to abandon their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, their Abbot, Dom Stanislaus, purchased the ruins of the ancient Abbey of Sept-Fons, removed his community thither, and rebuilt the church and regular structures. In 1847 he was elected <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the Congregation of the Ancient Reform of Our Lady of La Trappe, which followed the constitutions of the Abbot de Ranc&eacute;. In 1892, when the three congregations were united in one order, the then <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Sept-Fons, <a href="../cathen/15721b.htm">Dom Sebastian Wyart</a>, was elected first abbot-general, and, a little later, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>. Its most noted foundations are N.-D. de la Consolation near Peking, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, and N.-D. de Maristella Estado de S. Paulo, <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>.
