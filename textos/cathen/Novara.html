<h1>Novara</h1>  

<p>(NOVARIENSIS).

<p>A <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and the capital of the province of Novara, <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, noted for the manufacture of wool, cotton, and silk textiles, and machinery. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> originally Romanesque has been modified. The <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> is the work of Thorwaldsen, <a href="../cathen/09643b.htm">Marchesi</a>, and Finelli; the baldachin is by Tenarini, and there are <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Bordine, Crespi, and other artists, besides some ancient <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>; the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> dates from the fifth century. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> archives contain <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> and other documents from the eighth century. The church of <a href="../cathen/06393c.htm">St. Gaudentius</a>, a work of Pellegrino Pellegrini, was begun in 1553 to replace the ancient basilica built by <a href="../cathen/06393c.htm">St. Gaudentius</a> and torn down to make room for the fortifications; <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> in style, although the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> does not harmonize, it contains valuable <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> and frescoes by Lombard, Caccia, Procaccini, Crespi, Gilardini, Sogni, Saletta, and Fiamminghino. The city has an institute of arts and trades, a museum of antiquities, and several private galleries, among them the Leonardi. Novara was the birthplace of the ancient jurist, C. Albucius Silo, <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, the philologist Cattaneo, the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> Caccia, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/14781b.htm">Tornielli</a>. Novara, formerly Novaria, was inhabited by Ligurians and Salassians. Under the Carolingians, it was the seat of a count, but the power of the counts passed gradually to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, confirmed by Otho I (969), in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Bishop Aupaldus. From the time of Henry III, Novara was a commune, governed by two consuls and by a consul, called <em>Maggiore</em>. Frequently at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> and <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, it joined <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a> against the latter city, but in 1168 was compelled to join the Lombard League. After the peace of Constance it contended with the Counts of Biandrate, <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>, and its own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, unwilling to be deprived of their sovereign <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in which they had been again confirmed by <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a>. Upon the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1210, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> threatened to suppress the diocese. Later, when Martin della Torre became lord of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, Novara gave its allegiance to him, then to the Visconti, from which time it formed part of the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, with rare intervals; in 1536-38 it belonged to Monferrato, 1556-1602 to the Farnese of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, 1734 to the <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. Because of its position, Novara has been the scene of important battles: in April, 1500, Louis the Moor, Duke of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, intended to besiege here Trivulzi, appointed governor by the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but abandoned by his <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> troops, he was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. On 6 June, 1513, the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> in the pay of the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, drove out the French; on 10 April, 1812, the troops that had rebelled against King Charles Felix were dispersed there; on 23 March, 1849, Radetzky inflicted upon the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> a defeat that compelled King Charles Albert to abdicate.

<p>In the fourth century, Novara was in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>; its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/06393c.htm">St. Gaudentius</a>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by St. Simplicianus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (397-400). <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> is said to have introduced the Faith into Novara. St. Julius and St. Julian assisted Gaudentius in the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The list of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> has been preserved on two <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>, one in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> dates from 1168; the other in the church of <a href="../cathen/06393c.htm">St. Gaudentius</a> from 1343. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were St. Agabius (417); St. Victor (489); <a href="../cathen/07451a.htm">St. Honoratus</a> (c. 500); St. Leo (c. 700), biographer of <a href="../cathen/06393c.htm">St. Gaudentius</a>; Adalgisus (c. 840), called <em>Gemma Sacerdotum</em>; Albertus, killed by the Counts of Biandrate in 1081; Litifredus (1122) and Papiniano della Rovere (1296); Guglielmo Amidano (1343), a learned <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and former general of the Augustinians; Pietro Filargo (1388), later the <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Antipope Alexander V</a>; Bartolomeo Visconti (1429), deposed by <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>, who suspected him of treachery, but finally reinstated; Cardinal Gian Angelo Arcimboldi (1525); Gian Antonio Serbelloni (1560), founder of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; Francisco Rossi (1579), founder of a second <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; Carlo Bescap&eacute; (1593), a <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">Barnabite</a> historian of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; Benedetto Odescalchi (1650), later <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>. Suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>, it has 372 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; 408,000 inhabitants; 11 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men and 14 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; 2 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys, and 6 for girls; and 3 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> weekly publications.
