<h1>Novatian and Novatianism</h1>  

<p>Novatian was a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> of the third century, and founder of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the Novatians; he was a Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and made himself <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>. His name is given as Novatus (<em>Noouatos</em>, <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>; <em>Nauatos</em>, <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>) by Greek writers, and also in the verses of Damasus and Prudentius, on account of the metre.
<h2>Biography</h2>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> little of his life. <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">St. Cornelius</a> in his letter to Fabius of Antioch relates that Novatian was <a href="../cathen/12315a.htm">possessed by Satan</a> for a season, apparently while a <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcists</a> attended him, and he fell into a sickness from which instant death was expected; he was, therefore, given <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by affusion as he lay on his bed. The rest of the rites were not supplied on his recovery, nor was he confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. "How then can he have received the Holy Ghost?" asks <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a>. Novatian was a man of learning and had been trained in literary composition. <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> speaks of him sarcastically as "that maker of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, that champion of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> learning". His eloquence is mentioned by <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> (Ep. lx, 3) and a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (presumably Fabian) promoted him to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in spite of the protests (according to <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a>) of all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and many of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> that it was uncanonical for one who had received only clinical <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to be admitted among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The story told by <a href="../cathen/05603c.htm">Eulogius of Alexandria</a> that Novatian was <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was made a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in order to prevent his succeeding to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, contradicts the evidence of <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> and supposes a later state of things when the Roman <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> were statesmen rather than <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. The anonymous work "Ad Novatianum" (xiii) tells us that Novatian, "so long as he was in the one house, that is in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christ's Church</a>, bewailed the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of his neighbours as if they were his own, bore the burdens of the brethren, as the Apostle exhorts, and strengthened with consolation the backsliding in heavenly <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>."

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had enjoyed a peace of thirty-eight years when <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a> issued his edict of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> early in 250. Pope St. Fabian was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> on 20 January, and it was impossible to elect a successor. <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a>, writing in the following year, says of Novatian that, through cowardice and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of his life, he denied that he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>; for he was exhorted by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> to come out of the cell, in which he had shut himself up, to assist the brethren as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> now that they were in danger. But he was angry and departed, saying he no longer wished to be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, for he was in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with another philosophy. The meaning of this story is not clear. Did Novitian wish to eschew the active work of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and give himself to an ascetic life?

<p>At all events, during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> he certainly wrote letters in the name of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, which were sent by them to <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (Epp. xxx and xxxvi). The letters are concerned with the question of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">Lapsi</a>, and with the exaggerated claim of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> at Carthage to restore them all without penance. The Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> agree with <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> that the matter must be settled with moderation by councils to be held when this should be possible; the election of a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must be awaited; proper severity of discipline must be preserved, such as had always distinguished the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> since the days when her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was praised by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#vrs8">Romans 1:8</a>), but cruelty to the repentant must be avoided. There is evidently no <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> in the minds of the Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that restoration of the lapsed to communion is impossible or improper; but there are severe expressions in the letters. It seems that Novatian got into some trouble during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, since <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> says that St. Moses, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (d. 250), seeing the boldness of Novatian, separated him from communion, together with the five <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who had been associated with him.

<p>At the beginning of 251 the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> relaxed, and <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">St. Cornelius</a> was elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in March, "when the chair of Fabian, that is the place of Peter, was vacant", with the consent of nearly all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, of the people, and of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present (Cyprian, Ep. lv, 8-9). Some days later Novatian set himself up as a rival <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> tells us Novatian suffered an extraordinary and sudden change; for he had taken a tremendous <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that he would never attempt to become <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But now he sent two of his party to summon three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from a distant corner of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, telling them they must come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in haste, in order that a division might be healed by their mediation and that of other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. These simple men were constrained to confer the episcopal order upon him at the tenth hour of the day. One of these returned to the church bewailing and confessing his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, "and we despatched" says Comelius, "successors of the other two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to the places whence they came, after ordaining them." To ensure the loyalty of his supporters Novatian forced them, when receiving <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, to swear by the Blood and the Body of Christ that they would not go over to <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a>.



<p>Cornelius and Novatian sent messengers to the different Churches to announce their respective claims. From <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian's</a> correspondence we know of the careful investigation made by the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a>, with the result that <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> was supported by the whole African episcopate. <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">St. Dionysius of Alexandria</a> also took his side, and these influential adhesions soon made his position secure. But for a time the whole Church was torn by the question of the rival <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. We have few details. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> writes that Novatian "assumed the primacy" (Ep. lxix, 8), and sent out his new apostles to many cities to set new foundations for his new establishment; and, though there were already in all provinces and cities <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of venerable age, of pure <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of tried virtue, who had been proscribed in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, he dared to create other <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> over their heads (Ep. lv, 24) thus claiming the right of substituting <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by his own authority as <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> did in the case just mentioned. There could be no more startling <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the importance of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> than this sudden revelation of an episode of the third century: the whole Church convulsed by the claim of an <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>; the recognized impossibility of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> being a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and legitimate <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> if he is on the side of the wrong <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; the uncontested claim of both rivals to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in any place (at all events, in the West) where the existing <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> resisted their authority. Later, in the same way, in a letter to Pope Stephen, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> urges him to appoint (so he seems to imply) a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at Arles, where the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had become a Novatianist. <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">St. Dionysius of Alexandria</a> wrote to Pope Stephen that all the Churches in the East and beyond, which had been split in two, were now united, and that all their <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> were now rejoicing exceedingly in this unexpected peace &#151; in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, Caesarea of Palestine, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, Laodicea of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> and all the Churches of Cilicia, <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">Caesarea</a> and all Cappadocia, the Syrias and Arabia (which depended for <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>), Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> and Bithynia, "and all the Churches everywhere", so far did the Roman <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> cause its effects to be felt. Meanwhile, before the end of 251, <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> had assembled a council of sixty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (probably all from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> or the neighbouring islands), in which Novatian was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were not present added their signatures, and the entire list was sent to Antioch and doubtless to all the other principal Churches.

<p>It is not surprising that a man of such talents as Novatian should have been, conscious of his superiority to <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a>, or that he should have found <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to assist his ambitious views. His mainstay was in the confessors yet in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, Maximus, Urbanus, Nicostratus, and others. Dionysius and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> wrote to remonstrate with them, and they returned to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A prime mover on Novatian's side was the Carthaginian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Novatus, who had favoured laxity at Carthage out of opposition to his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian's</a> earlier letters about Novatian (xliv-xlviii, 1), there is not a word about any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, the whole question being as to the legitimate occupant of the place of Peter. In Ep. li, the words "schismatico immo haeretico furore" refer to the wickedness of opposing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of "haereticae pravitatis nocens factio" with Ep. liii. In Ep. liv, <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to send his book <a href="../fathers/050703.htm">"De lapsis"</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, so that the question of the lapsed was already prominent, but Ep. lv is the earliest in which the "Novatian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>" as such is argued against. The letters of the Roman confessors (Ep. liii) and <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> (xlix, 1) to <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> do not mention it, though the latter speaks in general terms of Novatian as a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> or a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>; nor does the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> mention <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in his abuse of Novatian in the letter to Fabius of Antioch (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, VI, xliii), from which so much has been quoted above. It is equally clear that the letters sent out by Novatian were not concerned with the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsi</a>, but were "letters full of <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> and maledictions sent in large numbers, which threw nearly all the Churches into disorder"' (Cornelius, Ep. xlix). The first of those sent to Carthage consisted apparently of "bitter accusations" against <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> thought it so disgraceful that he did not read it to the council (Ep. xlv, 2)., The messengers from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to the Carthaginian Council broke out into similar attacks (Ep. xliv). It is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to notice this point, because it is so frequently overlooked by historians, who represent the sudden but short-lived disturbance throughout the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> caused by Novatian's <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to have been a division between <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> on the subject of his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Yet it is obvious enough that the question could not present itself: "Which is preferable, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> or that of Novatian?" If Novatian were ever so <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, the first matter was to examine whether his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> was legitimate or not, and whether his accusations against <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> were <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. An admirable reply addressed to him by <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">St. Dionysius of Alexandria</a> has been preserved (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, VI, xlv): "Dionysius to his brother Novatian, greeting. If it was against your will, as you say, that you were led, you will prove it by retiring of your <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. For you ought to have suffered anything rather than divide the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> and to be <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> rather than cause a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> would have been no less glorious than to be <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> rather than commit <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, nay in my opinion it would have been a yet greater act; for in the one case one is a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> for one's own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone, in the other for the whole Church". Here again there is no question of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.

<p>But yet within a couple of months Novatian was called a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, not only by <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> but throughout the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for his severe views about the restoration of those who had lapsed in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. He held that <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> was an unpardonable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to restore to communion any who had fallen into it. They might repent and be admitted to a lifelong penance, but their forgiveness must be left to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; it could not be pronounced in this world. Such harsh sentiments were not altogether a novelty. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> had resisted the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> by Pope Callistus as an innovation. <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> was equally inclined to severity. In various places and at various times <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were made which punished certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> either with the deferring of Communion till the hour of death, or even with refusal of Communion in the hour of death. Even <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> approved the latter course in the case of those who refused to do penance and only repented on their death-bed; but this was because such a repentance seemed of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> sincerity. But severity in itself was but cruelty or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>; there was no <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> until it was denied that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has the power to grant <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> in certain cases. This was Novatian's <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> says the Novatians held no longer the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> creed and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> interrogation, for when they said "Dost thou <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and everlasting life, through Holy Church?" they were liars.
<h2>Writings</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> mentions a number of writings of Novatian, only two of which have come down to us, the "De Cibis Judaicis" and the "De Trinitate". The former is a letter written in retirement during a time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and was preceded by two other letters on Circumcision and the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, which are lost. It interprets the unclean animals as signifying different classes of vicious men; and explains that the greater liberty allowed to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> is not to be a motive for luxury. The book "De Trinitate" is a fine piece of writing. The first eight chapters concern the transcendence and greatness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is above all thought and can be described by no name. Novatian goes on to prove the Divinity of the Son at great length, arguing from both the Old and the New Testaments, and adding that it is an insult to the Father to say that a Father who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot beget a Son who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But Novatian falls into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> made by so many early writers of separating the Father from the Son, so that he makes the Father address to the Son the command to create, and the Son obeys; he identifies the Son with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who appeared in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> to Agar, Abraham, etc. "It pertains to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Christ that he should be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> because He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and that He should be an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angel</a> because He announces the Father's Will" (<em>paternae dispositionis annuntiator est</em>). The Son is "the second Person after the Father", less than the Father in that He is originated by the Father; He is the imitator of all His works, and is always obedient to the Father, and is one with Him "by concord, by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and by affection".

<p>No wonder such a description should seem to opponents to make two Gods; and consequently, after a chapter on the Holy Ghost (xxix), Novatian returns to the subject in a kind of appendix (xxx-xxxi). Two kinds of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, he explains, try to guard the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the one kind (Sabellians) by identifying the Father with the Son, the other (<a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>, etc.) by denying that the Son is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; thus is Christ again crucified between two thieves, and is reviled by both. Novatian declares that there is indeed but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unbegotten, invisible, immense, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; the Word (<em>Sermo</em>), His Son, is a substance that proceeds from Him (<em>substantia prolata</em>), whose generation no apostle nor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> nor any creature can declare. He is not a second <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> <em>in</em> the Father, else the Father would not be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> Father. He proceeded from the Father, when the Father willed (this <em>syncatabasis</em> for the purpose of creation is evidently distinguished from the eternal begetting <em>in</em> the Father), and remained <em>with</em> the Father. If He were also the unbegotten, invisible, incomprehensible, there might indeed be said to be two Gods; but in fact He has from the Father whatever He has, and there is but one origin (<em>origo, principium</em>), the Father. "One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is demonstrated, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and eternal Father, from whom alone this energy of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> is sent forth, being handed on to the Son, and again by communion of substance it is returned to the Father." In this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> there is much that is incorrect, yet much that seems meant to express the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">consubstantiality</a> of the Son, or at least His generation out of the substance of the Father. But it is a very unsatisfactory unity which is attained, and it seems to be suggested that the Son is not immense or invisible, but the image of the Father capable of manifesting Him. <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> is in the same difficulty, and it appears that Novatian borrowed from him as well as from <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>. It would seem that <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> understood somewhat better than did Novatian the traditional Roman <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">consubstantiality</a> of the Son, but that all three were led astray by their acquaintance with the Greek <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, which interpreted of the Son as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Scriptural expressions (especially those of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>) which properly apply to Him as the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">God-Man</a>. But at least Novatian has the merit of not identifying the Word with the Father, nor Sonship with the prolation of the Word for the purpose of Creation, for He plainly teaches the eternal generation. This is a notable advance on <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>.

<p>On <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">the Incarnation</a> Novatian seems to have been <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, though he is not explicit. He speaks correctly of the one Person having two substances, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> and Humanity, in the way that is habitual to the most exact Western <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. But he very often speaks of "the man" assumed by the Divine Person, so that he has been suspected of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianizing</a>. This is unfair, since he is equally liable to the opposite accusation of making "the man" so far from being a distinct <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> that He is merely flesh assumed (<em>caro</em>, or <em>substantia carnis et corporis</em>). But there is no real ground for supposing that Novatian meant to deny an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in Christ; he does not think of the point, and is only anxious to assert the reality of our Lord's flesh. The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, he says, joins to Himself the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, and by this connection and mingling he makes the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> become <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, which He was not by nature. This last sentence has been described as <a href="../cathen/01150a.htm">Adoptionism</a>. But the Spanish Adoptionists taught that the Human Nature of Christ as joined to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> is the adopted <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Novatian only means that before its assumption it was not by nature the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; the form of words is bad, but there is not necessarily any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in the thought. <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, though he does not make the best of Novatian, says that he "approaches more nearly to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> precision than any of the writers of the East and West" who preceded him (Tracts <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, p. 239).

<p>The two pseudo-Cyprianic works, both by one author, "De Spectaculis" and "De bono pudicitiae", are attributed to Novatian by Weyman, followed by Demmler, Bardenhewer, Harnack, and others. The pseudo-Cyprianic "De laude martyrii" has been ascribed to Novatian by Harnack, but with less probability. The pseudo-Cyprianic sermon, "Adversus Judaeos", is by a close friend or follower of Novatian if not by himself, according to Landgraf, followed by Harnack and Jordan. In 1900 Mgr Batiffol with the help of Dom A. Wilmart published, under the title of "Tractatus Origenis de libris SS. Scripturarum", twenty sermons which he had discovered in two <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> and <a href="../cathen/11251a.htm">St. Omer</a>. Weyman, Haussleiter, and Zahn perceived that these curious <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> on the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> were written in Latin and are not translations from the Greek. They attributed them to Novatian with so much confidence that a disciple of Zahn's, H. Jordan, has written a book on the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of Novatian, grounded principally on these sermons. It was, however, pointed out that the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> is of a more developed and later character than that of Novatian. Funk showed that the mention of competentes (candidates for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>) implies the fourth century. Dom Morin suggested <a href="../cathen/07009a.htm">Gregorius Baeticus</a> of Illiberis (Elvira), but withdrew this when it seemed clear that the author had used <a href="../cathen/06394a.htm">Gaudentius of Brescia</a> and Rufinus' translation of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> on Genesis. But these resemblances must be resolved in the sense that the "Tractatus" are the originals, for finally Dom Wilgory showed that Gregory of Elvira is their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> author, by a comparison especially with the five <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> of Gregory on the Canticle of Canticles (in Heine's "Bibliotheca Anecdotorum" Leipzig, 1848).
<h2>The Novationist sect</h2>

<p>The followers of Novatian named themselves <em>katharoi</em>, or <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a>, and affected to call the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <em>Apostaticum, Synedrium,</em> or <em>Capitolinum</em>. They were found in every province, and in some places were very numerous. Our chief information about them is from the "History" of <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, who is very favourable to them, and tells us much about their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, especially those of Constantinople. The chief works written against them are those of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, the anonymous "Ad Novatianum" (attributed by Harnack to <a href="../cathen/14031c.htm">Sixtus II</a>, 257-8), writings of St. Pacian of Barcelona and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> (De paenitentia), "Contra Novatianum", a work of the fourth century among the works of St. Augustine, the "Heresies" of Epiphanius and <a href="../cathen/11797a.htm">Philastrius</a>, and the "Quaestiones" of <a href="../cathen/01406a.htm">Ambrosiaster</a>. In the East they are mentioned especially by <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, Basil, <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>. <a href="../cathen/05603c.htm">Eulogius of Alexandria</a>, not long before 600, wrote six books against them. Refutations by Reticius of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a> and Eusebius of <a href="../cathen/05402a.htm">Emesa</a> are lost.

<p>Novatian had refused <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolaters</a>; his followers extended this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> to all "mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" (<a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, or fornication). Most of them forbade second marriage, and they made much use of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian's</a> works; indeed, in Phrygia they combined with the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a>. A few of them did not rebaptize converts from other persuasions. Theodoret says that they did not use confirmation (which Novatian himself had never received). Eulogius complained that they would not venerate <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, but he probably refers to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. They always had a successor of Novatian at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and everywhere they were governed by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at Constantinople were most estimable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, who has much to relate about them. The conformed to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in almost everything, including monasticism in the fourth century. Their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at Constantinople was invited by Constantine to the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>. He approved the decrees, though he would not consent to union. On account of the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm"><em>homoousion</em></a> the Novatians were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> like the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> by Constantius. In Paphlagonia the Novatianist peasants attacked and slew the soldiers sent by the emperor to enforce conformity to the official <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">semi-Arianism</a>. <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>, who at first treated them as schismatics, not <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, later ordered the closing of their churches and cemeteries. After the death of Constantius they were protected by <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> them once more. Honorius included them in a law against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in 412, and St. Innocent I closed some of their churches in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. St. Celestine expelled them from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as St. Cyril had from <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. Earlier <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> had shut up their churches at Ephesus, but at Constantinople they were tolerated, and their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> there are said by <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> to have been highly respected. The work of Eulogius shows that there were still Novatians in Alexandria about 600. In Phrygia (about 374) some of them became Quartodecimans, and were called <em>Protopaschitoe</em>; they included some converted <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> made a stringent law against this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, which was imported to Constantinople about 391 by a certain Sabbatius, whose adherents were called <em>Sabbatiani</em>.
