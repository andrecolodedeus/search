<h1>Novena</h1>  

<p>(From <em>novem</em>, nine.)

<p>A nine days' private or public devotion in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to obtain special <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11204a.htm">octave</a> has more of the festal character; to the novena belongs that of hopeful mourning, of yearning, of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. "The number nine in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> is indicative of suffering and grief" (<a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, in Ezech., vii, 24; &#151; P.L., XXV, 238, cf. XXV, 1473). The novena is permitted and even recommended by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, but still has no proper and fully set place in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It has, however, more and more been prized and utilized by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Four kinds of novenas can be distinguished: novenas of mourning, of preparation, of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgenced</a> novenas, though this distinction is not exclusive.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had no nine days' religious celebration or nine days' mourning or <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> on the ninth day after the death or burial of relatives and friends. They held the number seven more sacred than any other. On the contrary, we find among the ancient Romans an official nine days' religious celebration whose origin is related in Livy (I, xxxi). After a shower of stones on the Alban Mount, an official sacrifice, whether because of a warning from above or of the augurs' advice, was held on nine days to appease the gods and avert <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. From then on the same novena of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> was made whenever the like wonder was announced (cf. Livy, XXI, lxii; XXV, vii; XXVI, xxiii etc.).

<p>Besides this custom, there also existed among the Greeks and Romans that of a nine days' mourning, with a special <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> on the ninth day after death or burial. This, however, was rather of a private or <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> character (cf. Homer, Iliad, XXIV, 664, 784; Virgil, Aeneid, V, 64; Tacitus, Annals, VI, v.). The Romans also celebrated their <em>parentalia novendialia</em>, a yearly novena (13 to 22 Feb.) of commemoration of all the departed members of their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> (cf. Mommsen, "Corp. Inscript. Latin.", I, 386 sq.). The celebration ended on the ninth day with a sacrifice and a joyful banquet. There is a reference to these customs in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Emperor Justinian</a> ("Corp. Jur. Civil. Justinian.", II, Turin, 1757, 696, tit. xix, "De sepulchro violato"), where creditors are forbidden to trouble the heirs of their debtor for nine days after his death. St. Augustine (P.L., XXXIV, 596) warns <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> not to imitate the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> custom, as there is no example of it in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. Later on, the same was done by the Pseudo-Alcuin (P.L., CI, 1278), invoking the authority of St. Augustine, and still more sharply by John Beleth (P.L., CCII, 160) in the twelfth century. Even Durandus in his "Rationale" (Naples, 1478), writing on the <a href="../cathen/11220a.htm">Office of the Dead</a>, remarks that "some did not approve this, to avoid the appearance of aping <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> customs".

<p>Nevertheless, in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mortuary celebrations, one finds that of the ninth day with those of the third and seventh. The "Constitutiones Apostolicae" (VIII, xlii; P.G., I, 1147) already speak of it. The <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> existed specially in the East, but is found also among the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> and Anglo-Saxons. Even if it was connected with an earlier practice of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, it nevertheless had in itself no vestige of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. A nine days' mourning with daily Mass was a distinction, naturally, which could be shared by none but the higher classes. Princes and the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">rich</a> ordered such a celebration for themselves in their wills; even in the wills of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> such orders are found. Already in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the novena of Masses for <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> was customary. Later on, the mortuary celebration for <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> became constantly more simple, until finally it was regulated and fixed by the Constitution "Praecipuum" of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (23 Nov., 1741). For deceased <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiffs</a> the nine days' mourning was retained, and so came to be called simply the "Pope's Novena" (cf. <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>, "Museum Italicum", II, Paris, 1689, 530 sqq., "Ordo Roman. XV"; P.L., LXXVIII, 1353; Const. "In eligendis" of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, 9 Oct., 1562). The usage still continues and consists chiefly in a novena of Masses for the departed. A <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> of the Sacred Congregation of Rites (22 Apr., 1633) informs us that such novenas of mourning, <em>officia novendialia ex testamento</em>, were generally <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and allowed in the churches of religious (Decr. Auth. S.R.C., 604). They are no longer in common use, though they have never been forbidden, and indeed, on the contrary, <em>novendiales precum et Missarum devotiones pro defunctis</em> were approved by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> (11 July, 1853 [sic]) and <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgenced</a> for a confraternity <em>agonizantium</em> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (Resc. Auth. S.C. Indulg., 382).

<p>Besides the novena for the dead, we find in the earlier part of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the novena of preparation, but at first only before <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> and only in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. This had its origin in the nine months <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> was in <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">His Blessed Mother's</a> womb from the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> to the Nativity. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the <a href="../cathen/01542a.htm">Annunciation</a> was transferred for the whole country by the tenth Council of Toledo in 656 (Cap. i; <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Coll. Conc.", XI, 34) to 18 Dec., as the most fitting <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> preparatory to <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>. With this it appears that a real novena of preparation for <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> was immediately connected for the whole of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. At any rate, in a question sent from the <a href="../cathen/02168a.htm">Azores</a> (Insulae Angrenses) to the Sacred Congregation of Rites, an appeal was made to the "most ancient <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a>" of celebrating, just before <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, nine <a href="../cathen/15508b.htm">votive Masses</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>. And this usage, because of the people who took part in the celebration, was permitted to continue (28 Sept., 1658; Decr. Auth., 1093). A French <em>Ordinarium</em> (P.L., CXLVII, 123) prescribes that the preparation for <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> on the ninth day should begin with the O anthems and that each day, at the <a href="../cathen/09534a.htm">Magnificat</a>, the altar and the choir should be <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a>. The Ordinarium of <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01576b.htm">Antiphonary</a> of <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>, in place of the seven common O anthems, have nine for the nine days before <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, and these were sung with special <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> (Martene, "De Antiq. Eccles. Ritib.", III, Venice, 1783, 30). In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the novena seems to have spread only in the seventeenth century. Still, the "Praxis caeremoniarum seu sacrorum Romanae Ecclesiae Rituum accurata tractatio" of the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine</a> Piscara Castaldo, a book approved in 1525 by the author's father general (Naples, 1645, p. 386 sqq.), gives complete directions for the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> novena with <a href="../cathen/05713a.htm">Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament</a>. The author remarks that this novena in commemoration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> nine months in the womb was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> celebrated in very many places in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. And in the beginning of the eighteenth century the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> novena held such a distinguished position that the Sacred Congregation of Rites (7 July, 1718), in a special case, allowed for it alone the solemn celebration with Exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> (Decr. Auth., 2250).



<p>But before this, at least in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> had sprung up among religious of preparing for the feast of their founder with a novena of Masses, and these <em>Missae novendiales votivae</em> were also (2 Sept., 1690) declared permissible (Decr. Auth., 1843). In general, in the seventeenth century, numerous novenas were held especially in the churches of religious and to the Saints of the various orders (cf. Prola, "De Novendialibus supplicationibus", Romae 1724, <em>passim</em>). Two hundred years later, on application from <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> for Exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> in the celebration of novenas, special permission was granted (Decr. Auth., 3728), and in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> on the <em>Missae votivae</em> of 30 June, 1896, there is really question of the <em>Missae votivae novendiales B.M.V.</em> (Decr. Auth., 3922 V, n. 3). At least in this way, then, the novena is recognized even in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgy</a>.

<p>At the same time as the <em>novena of preparation</em>, the proper <em>novena of prayer</em> arose, among the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, it would seem, who in their need turned to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> with a novena, especially to recover health. The original home of this novena must have been <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and the neighbourhood of the Lower Rhine. Specially noteworthy up to the year 1000 are the novenas to <a href="../cathen/07507a.htm">St. Hubert</a>, St. Marcolf, and St. Mommolus. St. Mommolus (or Mummolus) was considered the special <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron</a> for head and brain diseases; the novenas to him were made especially in the Holy Cross Monastery of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> (Mabillon, "Act. Sanct. O. S. B.", II, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1733, 645 sqq.; "Acta SS.", August, II, 351 sqq.; <a href="../cathen/05181b.htm">Du Cange</a>, "Glossarium", s.v. "Novena"). St. Marcolf procured for the kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the power to cure scrofula by a touch of their hand. For this purpose, shortly after their <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> and anointing at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, the kings had to go in person on <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Marcolf at Corbeny and make a novena there. Those who were to be healed had to make a similar novena. But the best known is the novena to <a href="../cathen/07507a.htm">St. Hubert</a>, which continues even to our day. This is made against madness by people bitten by a mad dog or wolf (Acta SS., November, I, 871 sqq.).

<p>The last-named novena was attacked in later times, particularly by the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, and was rejected as <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> (cf. "Acta SS.", loc. cit., where the attack is met and the novena justified). Before this, <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a>, in the fourteenth century, had given warning against the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> abuse of this novena. But he does not reject novenas in general and we see from his works that in his time they were already widespread (Opera, Paris, 1606, II, 328; III, 386, 389). But notwithstanding <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson's</a> warning, novenas were from that time on ever more and more in favour with the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, to which the many, even <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>, effects of the novenas contributed not a little. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> (De canonizat. sanct., lib. IV, p. II, c. xiii, n. 12) tells of a number of such <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> adduced in the processes of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from their own experience that the novena is no <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>, <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> custom, but one of the best means to obtain signal <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> through the <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> and all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. The novena of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is thus a kind of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which includes in it, so to speak, as a pledge of being heard, confidence and perseverance, two most important <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">qualities</a> of efficacious <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Even if the employment of the number nine in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> were connected with a similar use in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>, the use would still in no way be blameable or at all <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a>. Not, of course, that every single variation or addition made in whatever private novena must be justified or defended. The holiest custom can be abused, but the use of the number nine can not only be justified but even interpreted in the best sense.

<p>The number ten is the highest, the <em>numerus maximus</em>, simply the <em>most perfect</em>, which is fitting for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the number nine, which is lacking of ten, is the number of imperfection, which is fitting for mortal kind. In some such way the <a href="../cathen/12587b.htm">Pythagoreans</a>, <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo the Jew</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, philosophized on the meaning of the number nine. For this reason it was adapted for use where <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> imperfection turned in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, loc. cit.; <a href="../cathen/02042b.htm">Athenagoras</a>, <a href="../fathers/0205.htm"><em>A Plea for the Christians</em></a>; Pseudo-Ambrosius, P.L., XVII, 10 sq., 633; <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a>, P.L., CIX, 948 sq., CXI, 491; Angelomus Monach., In Lib. Reg. IV, P.L., CXV, 346; <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo the Jew</a>, "Lucubrationes", Basle, 1554, p. 283).

<p>In the novena of mourning and the Mass on the ninth day it was remembered in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> gave up the ghost in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> at the ninth hour, as in the penitential books (cf. Schmitz, "Die Bussbucher und die Bussdisciplin", II, 1898, 539, 570, 673), or remarked that, by means of Holy Mass on the ninth day, the departed were to be raised to the ranks of the nine choirs of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> (cf. Beleth, loc. cit.; Durandus, loc. cit.). For the origin of the novena of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> we can point to the fact that the ninth hour in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">Synagogue</a>, like <a href="../cathen/11097a.htm">None</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a>, was a special hour of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> from the beginning, so that it was reckoned among the "apostolic hours" (cf. <a href="../bible/act003.htm#vrs1">Acts 3:1</a> and <a href="../bible/act010.htm#vrs30">10:30</a>; <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="../fathers/0408.htm"><em>On Fasting</em> 10</a>; cf. <a href="../fathers/0322.htm"><em>On Prayer</em> 25</a>). The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, too, in the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, has for centuries invoked the Almighty in nine Psalms and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> Him in nine Lessons, while from ancient times the Kyrie has been heard nine times in every Mass (cf. Durandus, "Rationale, De nona"; <a href="../cathen/02645b.htm">Bona</a>, "Opera", <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1764; "De divina psalmodia", p. 401).

<p>As has been said, the simplest explanation of the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> novena is the nine months of Christ in the womb. But for every novena of preparation, as also for every novena of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, not only the best explanation but also the best model and example was given by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the first Pentecost novena. He Himself expressly exhorted the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> to make this preparation. And when the young Church had faithfully persevered for nine full days in it, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came as the precious fruit of this first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> novena for the feast of the establishment and foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. If one keeps this in mind and remembers besides that novenas in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> have brought so many, even <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>, answers to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and that finally <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself in the <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> to Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque recommended the special celebration of nine successive first Fridays of the month (cf. Vermeersch, "Pratique et doctrine de la d&eacute;votion au Sacr&eacute; Coeur de J&eacute;sus", <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, 1906, 555 sqq.), one must wonder that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> waited so long before positively approving and recommending novenas rather than that she finally took this step (cf. "Collection de pr&eacute;cis historiques", <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, 1859, "Des neuvaines", 157 sqq.).

<p>Not until the nineteenth century did the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> formally recommend novenas by the concession of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a>. This brings us to the last kind of novenas, those which are <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgenced</a>. Apparently <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> in the middle of the seventeenth century granted <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> to a novena in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> made in <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> (cf. Prola, op. cit., p. 79). The first novena <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgenced</a> in the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and even there for only one church, was the novena in preparation for the feast of St. Joseph in the church of St. Ignatius. This was done by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Briefs</a> of <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, 10 Feb., and 4 March, 1713 (cf. Prola, loc. cit.; <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, "De canoniz.", loc. cit.). The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who used before this to have a novena for the feast of the <a href="../cathen/07674d.htm">Immaculate Conception</a> (cf. Decr. Auth. S.R.C., 2472) received special <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> for it on 10 Apr., 1764 (Resc. Auth. S.C. Indulg., 215). Not until later, especially from the beginning of the nineteenth century, were various novenas enriched with <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> in common for the whole Church. They number in all thirty-two, intended for the most part as novenas of preparation for definite <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a>.

<p>They are in detail as follows: one in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Most Holy Trinity</a>, which may be made either prior to the feast of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> (first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> after Pentecost) or at any other time of the year; two to the Holy Ghost, one to be made prior to the feast of Pentecost for the reconciliation of non-Catholics (this is also made publicly in all <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> churches), one at any time of the year; two novenas to the Infant <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, one to be made before the feast of <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> and the other at any time during the year; three to the <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">Sacred Heart</a>, one prior to the feast of the Sacred Heart (the Friday after the <a href="../cathen/11204a.htm">octave</a> of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>), one at any time during the year, and the third that of the nine first Fridays, which is based on the promise made to Blessed Margaret Mary by the Sacred Heart assuring the grace of <a href="../cathen/11711a.htm">final perseverance</a> and the reception of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a> before death to all who should receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> on the first Friday of every month for nine consecutive months; it is customary to offer this novena in <a href="../cathen/12775a.htm">reparation</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>; eleven novenas in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, viz., in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Immaculate Conception, the Nativity of Mary, her Presentation at the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple</a>, the Annunciation, the Visitation, the Maternity of Mary, her <a href="../cathen/03245b.htm">Purification</a>, her Seven Dolours, the Assumption, the <a href="../cathen/07168a.htm">Holy Heart of Mary</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Holy Rosary</a>; one novena each in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Archangels Michael, Gabriel and <a href="../cathen/12640b.htm">Raphael</a>, and one in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07049c.htm">Guardian Angel</a>, two to <a href="../cathen/13356b.htm">St. Joseph</a>, one consisting of the recitation of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the seven sorrows and seven joys of the foster-father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, prior to the feast of St. Joseph (19 March) and one at any time during the year; one novena each in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, at any time during the year, <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/11590a.htm">St. Paul of the Cross</a>, <a href="../cathen/14245b.htm">St. Stanislaus Kostka</a>, prior to his feast (13 November), <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, and one for the Holy Souls.

<p>The novena in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, known as the "Novena of Grace", originated as follows: in 1633 Father Mastrilli, S.J., was at the point of death as a result of an <a href="../cathen/01096c.htm">accident</a>, when <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, to whom he had great devotion, appeared to him and urged him to devote himself to the missions of the <a href="../cathen/07758a.htm">Indies</a>. Father Mastrilli then made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> before his provincial that he would go to the Indies if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> spared his life, and in another <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">apparition</a> (3 Jan., 1634) <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> exacted of him a renewal of this promise, foretold his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and restored him to health so completely that on the same night Father Mastrilli was in a condition to write an account of his cure, and the next morning to celebrate <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> at the altar of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> and to resume his community life. He soon set out for the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> missions where he was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>, 17 October, 1637. The renown of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> quickly spread through <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and inspired with confidence in the power and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> implored his assistance in a novena with such success that it came to be called the "novena of grace". This novena is now made publicly in many countries from 4 to 12 March, the latter being the date of the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> together with St. Ignatius. The conditions include a visit to a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> church or <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> may be gained on any day of the novena, and those who are prevented by illness or another legitimate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> from communicating during the novena may gain the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> by doing so as soon as possible. All of these novenas without exception are to be made, in private or in public, with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> exercises and the reception of the Sacraments, and for these usually a daily partial <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> can be gained and a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> at the end of the novena. The <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> and the conditions for gaining them are accurately given in detail in the <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authentic</a> <a href="../cathen/12620a.htm">"Raccolta"</a> and in the works on <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> by Beringer and Hilgers, which have appeared in various languages. The <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgenced</a> novenas, to a certain extent official, have but contributed to increase the confidence of the faithful in novenas. Hence, even the private novena of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> flourishes in our day. Through the novena to Our Lady of Lourdes, through that to <a href="../cathen/01556a.htm">St. Anthony of Padua</a> or some other saint, the faithful seek and find help and relief. The history of novenas is not yet written, but it is doubtless a good part of the history of childlike <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">veneration</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> and all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, of lively confidence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and especially of the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
