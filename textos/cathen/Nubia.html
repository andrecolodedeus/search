<h1>Nubia</h1>  

<p>Located in North-eastern Africa, extending from Sennar south to beyond Khartoum and including the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Sudan. The southern section includes Sennar with Dschesireh-el Dschesire (Island of Islands), the ancient Meroe; the western, Bahr el Abiad, Kordofan, and Darfur; the eastern, Tarka; the central, Dongola; and the northern, Nubia proper. The various tribes belong to the Ethiopian or Berber <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, intermixed with Arabians; in the south <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> preponderate. Nubia embraces 335,597 square miles and contains 1,000,000 inhabitants; Dongola, Berber, Khartoum, Fashoda, Sennar, Fassuglo, 75,042 square miles with 2,500,000 inhabitants; Taka, 7766 square miles with 1,000,000 inhabitants; Kordofan, 35,069 square miles with 300,000 inhabitants; Darfur, 106,070 square miles with 4,000,000 inhabitants; Shegga, 85,017 square miles with 1,400,000 inhabitants. The chief cities are: Khartoum, at the junction of the White and Blue Niles, founded in 1823 and the starting-point of all scientific and missionary expeditions, destroyed in 1885 by the Mahdi, rebuilt in 1898; Omdurman, on the Abiad, founded by the Mahdi; Sennar, capital of Southern Nubia; Kassala, capital of Taka. On the Nile are Berber, Abu-Hammed, Old Dongola, and New Dongola, capital of central Nubia; in Nubia proper, Derr, Wadi Halfa, and Assuan; in Kordofan, El-Obeid; in Darfur, El Fasho. Formerly the port of Nubia was Suakin on the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>; from 1906 it has been Port Sudan. Nubia is administered by the Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.
<h2>History</h2>

<p>Nubia is said to be derived from the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <em>Nub</em> (gold), as the Egyptians obtained most of their gold there. In the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> it is called <a href="../cathen/04575c.htm">Cush</a>. <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> sought repeatedly to extend its southern boundaries, and during the eighteenth dynasty reached Wadi Halfa. A temple was built at Napata (near the Fourth Cataract) by Amenophis III, and Rameses II waged successful <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Ethiopians. After this there arose in Napata near the sacred mountain Gebel Barkal an independent theocratic state; the remains of many of its <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> are still to be seen. During the twenty-third dynasty the Nubians shook off the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> yoke, and even conquered <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (750 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>); three Nubian kings ruled the united territory (732-668). Psametich I (664-10) drove out the Nubians, and Meroe replaced Napata, which maintained its sovereignty over Nubia until destroyed by the native king Ergamenes during the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus (285-47) . During Roman rule, the Nubians attempted to gain the <a href="../cathen/14561a.htm">Thebaid</a>, but Petronius in 25 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> conquered Napata and forced Queen Candace to make a treaty of peace. In the third century after Christ marauding incursions of Nubian tribes called the Biemmyer forced <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> to summon the Nobat&aelig; from El Charge in the Nile valley as confederates of the empire. Nevertheless Prima, Ph&oelig;nicon, Chiris, Taphis, and Talmis yielded. In. the fourth and fifth centuries the <a href="../cathen/14561a.htm">Thebaid</a> was so often devastated that Emperor Marcian was forced to conclude an unfavourable peace in 451. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, brought probably by the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14561a.htm">Thebaid</a>, began to spread through the country. The various accounts of this event are confusing; Pliny and Mela give the name of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> to all the countries in this region, including <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>, while <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers speak of an Ethiopian Church, but give no account of the conversion of individual lands. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was not yet well established, when about the middle of the sixth century under the protection of the empress Theodora, the Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Julian introduced <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>. Its adherents called themselves <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a>. The Nobat&aelig;an kings Silko and Eirpanomos accepted <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in this form, and the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> patriarch Theodosius, Bishop Theodore of Phil&aelig;, and Longinus, Julian's successor, put the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on a firm basis. In 580 Longinus <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the King of the Alod&aelig;. The final victory of the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> was secured by their union with the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, soon to be masters of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.

<p>In 640 Amr Ben el-Asi'S, the commander-in-chief of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, conquered <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and ended Byzantine supremacy. The <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> (Catholic) patriarch, George of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, fled to Constantinople and his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> for over a hundred years. The <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> secured peace only by becoming confederates of the enemy, and in return received nearly all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches; their patriarch alone exercised <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the entire territory. According to the Arabian Makrizi, as related by Ibn Selim, when the Nubians requested <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> they received from <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, and in this way became and remained <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> or <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a>. In the following centuries numerous churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were built even in Upper Nubia and Sennar, the ruins of which yet remain. Other documents show that Nubia was divided into three provinces with seventeen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: Maracu with the suffragan Dioceses of Korta, Ibrim, Bucoras, Dunkala, Sai, Termus, and Suenkur; Albadia with Borra, Gagara, Martin, Arodias, Banazi, and Menkesa; Niexamitis with Soper, Coucharim, Takchi, and Amankul. Yet <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was in continual danger from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a>. Nubia succeeded in freeing itself from the control of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, which became an independent <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> kingdom in 969, but in 1173 Saladin's brother Schems Eddawalah Turanschah advanced from Yemen, destroyed the churches, and carried off the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and 70,000 Nubians. At the same time Northern Nubia was conquered. In 1275 the <a href="../cathen/09578c.htm">Mameluke</a> sultan Djahn Beibars sent an army from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> into Nubia. Dongola was conquered, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> king David was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee, and the churches were plundered. The inhabitants escaped forcible conversion to <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a> only by payment of a head-tax. Nubia was divided into petty states, chief of which was Sennar, founded in 1484 by the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> Funji. For some time Sennar ruled Shendi, Berber, and Dongola. In the eighteenth century the King of Sennar obtained for a time Kordofan also. From the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> there is little information as to the position of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>; <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> became supreme, partly by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>, partly by the amalgamation of the native with the Arabian tribes.

<p>In 1821 Sennar and the dependent provinces submitted to Mohammed Ali, the founder of modern <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. The commanding position of the capital, Khartoum, led the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to hope that the conversion of Central Africa could be effected from Nubia. On 26 December, 1845, the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> erected a vicariate, confirmed by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, 3 April, 1846. The Austrian imperial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> contributed funds and the mission was under the protection of the Austrian consulate at Khartoum. Missionary work was begun by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> Ryllo (died 1848) and <a href="../cathen/08672a.htm">Knoblecher</a> (died 1858), who pushed forward as far as 4&deg; 10' north of the equator, Kirchner, and several <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> (among whom were <a href="../cathen/07119a.htm">Haller</a>, died 1854, and Gerbl, died 1857). They founded stations at <a href="../cathen/07198a.htm">Heiligenkreuz</a> on the Abiad (1855), and at Santa Maria in Gondokoro (1851). In 1861 the missions were transferred to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. <a href="../cathen/04152b.htm">Father Daniel Comboni</a> (died at Khartoum, 1881) founded an institute at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> for the training of missionaries to labour among the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> of Soudan. The Pious Mothers of the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">Negro</a> Country (<em>Pie Madri della Nigrizia</em>), founded in 1867, devoted itself to conducting <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for girls and dispensaries. The Mahdi, Mohammed Ahmed, in 1880 conquered Kordofan, in 1883 vanquished the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> army, and on 26 January, 1885, destroyed Khartoum. A number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and sisters were held for years in captivity; the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> seemed obliterated. After the overthrow of his successor, Caliph Abdullah, by the English under Lord Kitchener, 2 September, 1898, the mission was re-established. In 1895 a mission had been opened at Assuan. In 1899 Mgr Roveggio with Fathers Weiler and Huber established a station at Omdurman, and in 1900 founded the mission near the Shilluk and re-established the station at Khartoum. Under his successor, Geyer, stations were opened in 1904 at Halfaya, Lul, Atiko, Kayango; in 1905 at Mbili among the Djur, at Wau in Bahr el Ghazal, and the mission at Suakin, opened in 1885, was resumed. The Sons of the Sacred Cross, as the Missionaries of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> had been called from 1887, founded a station at Port Sudan.

<p>Starting from Khartoum the missionary territory is divided into a northern and a southern district. The majority of the population in the north is <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> and the chief task of the missionaries is pastoral work among the scattered <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities. In 1908 Khartoum had 69,344 inhabitants, Omdurman 57,985, among them about 2307 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a>, of whom about 1000 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Khartoum is served by 2 fathers, 1 brother, and 4 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> contain 42 boys and 75 girls. In Omdurman there are 300 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> 3 fathers, 1 brother, and 5 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; 44 boys and 45 girls attend the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. There is also a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls at Halfaya. At Assuan there are 2 fathers, 1 brother, and 4 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; 34 boys and 54 girls are taught in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. There are 500 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> among the workmen. At Port Sudan the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> number between 200 and 300. There are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> also at Halfa, Abu-Hammed, Dongola, Argo, Meraui, Berber, Atbara, Damer, Shendi, Kassala, Duen, El-Obeid, Bara, and Nahud. The southern missions among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> have already advanced beyond the boundaries of Nubia. The statistics for 1907 for the northern and southern missions were: 11 stations, 30 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 23 brothers, 41 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, 2407 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 492 boys and girls in the mission-schools.
