<h1>Nueva C&aacute;ceres</h1>  

<p>(NOVA CACERES)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> created in 1595 by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>; it is one of the four suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Archdiocese of Manila</a>, <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>. It comprises the provinces of Camarines Sur, Camarines Norte, Albay, and Tayabas in the southern part of Luzon, the islands Ticao, Masbate, Burias, and Cantanduanes, also numerous smaller islands off the coast of Southern Luzon. It includes a territory of 13,632 square miles, and has a population of nearly 600,000. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and episcopal residence are situated in the town of Nueva C&aacute;ceres, the capital of Camarines Sur. The territory now included in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was first visited by Augustinian Friars, who had accompanied the famous Legaspi-Urdaneta expedition of 1565. When the missionaries began their labors, they found the natives given over to gross <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatries</a> and <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a> (adoration of the sun, moon and stars, ancestral worship), and to the propitiation of a multitude of <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> by strange <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; nor did they seem to have any <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a supreme being. So fruitful, however, was the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> of the missionaries that, within a few years, many thousands of converts were made in Albay, in Camarines Sur, and in Masbate. Assisted by heroic <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, they gathered the natives into villages or reductions, where they instructed them in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of religion and taught them the advantages of a settled civilized life. The Augustinians had begun the spiritual conquest of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but, being few in number, they were unable to attend to so extensive a territory. In 1578 the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> were called to assist them. The arrival of the latter gave a new impulse to the work of evangelization. Missions and reductions were multiplied in Albay, in Camarines Sur, and in Masbate; and new foundations were made in the Province of Tayabas. The ranks of the missionaries were strengthened from time to time by workers from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and Mexico; as early as 1595 the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had made so much progress in these parts that <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> created the Diocese of Nueva C&aacute;ceres, taking the name from the town of Nueva C&aacute;ceres founded in Camarines Sur in 1579 by Francisco de Sande second Governor-General of the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Francisco de Ortega, an Augustinian friar who had labored for several years in the Province of <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a>. He took possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in 1600. The present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Rt. Rev. John B. McGinley, con. 1910) is his twenty-seventh successor.

<p>From the beginning until 1890, the greater number of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and missions were cared for by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and the Augustinians. Although the latter had resigned during the first years in favor of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, they returned to the diocese some years later and converted to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the whole of Camarines Norte. Each <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> had as its <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> a friar, assisted, according to the importance and population of the district, by one or more native <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. Only in later years were the latter placed in full charge of important <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. As late as 1897, out of a total of 90 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 43 were in charge of <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were also generally chosen from the various <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, though on several occasions members of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> held the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, the most noted being (1723) the saintly Bishop de Molina, a native of Iloilo, whose name is still held in veneration. The <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> came in 1870, under Bishop Gainza, and were placed in charge of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> then in process of construction. The same <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> introduced the Sisters of Charity and placed them in charge of the academy and normal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which he had founded. In 1886 the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> arrived and were given several missions. In 1898, on account of the revolution against Spanish rule and the feeling against the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, most of these religious were withdrawn from their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and missions, and <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> placed in charge. The present (1908) statistics of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are as follows: 168 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, of whom 25 are regulars; the religious who are not <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> number 12 (sisters 9, brothers 3); 122 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> with resident priests; without resident <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 6; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> 180, with 46,000 children in attendance (24,000 boys and 22,000 girls); one <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>; one academy for girls, with 200 in attendance; a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, preparatory and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, with 60 students; a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for secular students attached to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, with 500 students. The total population of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is nearly 600,000, of which number less than 1000 are non-Catholic.
