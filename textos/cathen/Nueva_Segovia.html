<h1>Nueva Segovia</h1>  

<p>(NOVAE SEGOBIAE)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, so called from <a href="../cathen/13684b.htm">Segovia</a>, a town in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The town of Nueva, or New, Segovia was in the Province of Cagayan, and was founded in 1581. Manila was the only diocese of the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a> until 14 Aug., 1595, when <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> created three others, namely Ceb&uacute;, <a href="../cathen/11148a.htm">Nueva C&aacute;ceres</a>, and Nueva Segovia. The latter see was established at Nueva Segovia. About the middle of the eighteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was transferred to Vigan, where it has since remained. The town of Nueva Segovia declined, was merged with a neighboring town called Lalloc, and its name preserved only by the diocese. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (Const. "Quae mari Sinico") created four new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, among them Tuguegarao, the territory of which was taken from Nueva Segovia, and comprises the Provinces of Cagayan, Isabela, Nueva Vizcaya, and two groups of small islands. The territory retained by the Diocese of Nueva Segovia embraces the Provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">Union</a>, Pangasinan, five towns in the province of Tarlac, the sub-province of Abra, and also a large part of what is called the Mountain province; all this territory lies between 15&#176; and 19&#176; N. lat. and is located in the large island of Luzon.

<p>The population of the Diocese of Nueva Segovia is about one million, consisting principally of the Ilocanos and Pangasinanes tribes, besides mountaineers who are nearly all Igorrotes. The Ilocanos and Pangasinanes live, mostly, in the plain between the mountains on the east and the <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> Sea on the west. They were all converted by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, and, up to the present time have, generally speaking, remained faithful to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Since the American occupation, a few <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> have established themselves here, and have drawn a few of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> class away from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The fidelity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was severely tested by the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of 1902, started by Rev. Gregorio Aglipay, an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He was born in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, was a high military officer during the rising of the natives against the American sovereignty, and found much sympathy, especially in this part of the islands. He pretended to champion the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the native <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, though the movement was political. He drew with him twenty-one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and a large number of lay people. He and his movement have been discredited, and the people, in large numbers, have returned to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Only a small part of the Igorrotes has been converted. The Spanish missionaries were evangelizing them until 1898, when the insurrection against the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> broke out, and the missionaries had to flee. <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> and German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have taken the place of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> in the missionary field, and gradually are reclaiming the people from their <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> and especially from their bloodthirsty customs.

<p>There is at Vigan a seminary-college under <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, with four hundred collegians and twenty seminarists; there is also a girls' college founded by the last <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Monsignor Hevia Campomanes, who had to flee in 1898. It is in charge of the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers have a boys' college in Dagupan, Province of Pangasinan, and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Sisters have a girls' college in Lingayen, the capital of the same province. In 1910 a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and college, under <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> sisters, was opened at Tagudin, a town of the Mountain Province, with an attendance of 305 girls, who receive manual as well as <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> training. A similar institution is projected for the subprovince of Abra, and will be entrusted to German sisters. Gradually <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are being organized, but in many cases it has been found extremely difficult to sustain the expense. The Spanish government supported religion in all its works; but since the separation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> the people, unaccustomed to contribute directly to the support of religion, find the maintenance of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions a difficult undertaking. At least Sunday <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are possible, and gradually they are coming into vogue. In Vigan, out of a population of 16,000, about 2000 go to Sunday <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. There are not and never were almshouses or asylums of any kind. The people are very charitable towards the poor and afflicted, who have the custom of going at stated times in a body to the homes of the well-to-do, where they receive some gifts and where they then publicly recite the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">rosary</a> for the spiritual good of their benefactors. Up to 1903 nearly all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Nueva Segovia were <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>. In that year Right Reverend D.J. Dougherty, D.D., an American, was appointed. He was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/08323d.htm">Diocese of Jaro</a>, <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>, and Right Reverend J.J. Carroll, D.D., the present (1910) incumbent, like the former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> an American, succeeded him.
