<h1>Nuncio</h1>  

<p>An ordinary and permanent representative of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, vested with both political and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> powers, accredited to the court of a sovereign or assigned to a definite territory with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of safeguarding the interests of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The special character of a nuncio, as distinguished from other <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> envoys (such as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, collectors), consists in this: that his office is specifically defined and limited to a defininte district (his nunciature), wherein he must reside; his mission is general, embracing all the interests of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; his office is permanent, requiring the appointment of a successor when one incumbent is recalled, and his mission includes both diplomatic and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> powers. Nuncios, in the strict sense of the word, first appear in the sixteenth century. The office, however, was not created at any definite moment or by any one <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> ordinance, but gradually developed under the influence of various historical factors into the form in which we find it in the sixteenth century. The first permanent representatives of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> at secular courts were the <em>apocrisarii</em> (q.v.; see also L<font size=-2>EGATE</font>) at the Byzantine Court. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> sent, for the settlement of important <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or political matters, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> (<em>legati a latere</em>, q.v.) with definite instructions and at times with ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The officials, sent from the fourteenth century for the purpose of collecting taxes either for the Roman Court or for the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a>, were called <em>nuntii, nuntii apostolici</em>. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries this title was given also to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> envoys entrusted with certain other affairs of an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or diplomatic nature. Frequently they were given the right of granting certain privileges, favours, and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Great Western Schism</a> and the period of the reform councils (fifteenth century), such embassies were more frequently resorted to by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Then were also gradually established permanent diplomatic representation at the various courts. With previous forms of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> representation as a precedent and modelled upon the permanent diplomatic legations of temporal sovereigns, there finally arose in the sixteenth century the permanent nunciatures of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>The exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the establishment of many of the nunciatures is not easy to determine, as it is impossible to fix exactly in all cases when an earlier type of <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal envoy</a> was replaced by a nuncio proper, and especially as in the beginning we find interruptions in the succession of envoys who, owing to their powers and their office, must be regarded as real nuncios. The necessity of resisting <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> was a special factor in the increase of the nunciatures. After the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> they became the chief agents of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in their efforts to check the spread of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and to carry out <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reform. The fact that in 1537 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> correspondence with foreign powers, previously carried on by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> private secretary, was handed over by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> to the vice-chancellor, Cardinal Alexander Farnese, was the chief element within the curia which led to the permanence of nunciatures. Thereby the political correspondence of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> lost its somewhat private character, and was entrusted to the secretariate of state, with which the nuncios were henceforth to be in constant communication. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> also employed extraordinary envoys for special purposes. Angelo Leonini, sent to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> by <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> in 1500, is commonly regarded as the first nuncio, as we understand the term today. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the collector-general of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> exchequer, Giovanni Ruffo dei Teodoli, was also given diplomatic powers; he resided in the country, and discharged these two offices from 1506 to 1518 or 1519. As his successors were appointed collectors-general with fiscal, and political representatives with diplomatic powers, so that from thenceforth the Spanish nunciature may be regarded as permanent. The beginning of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> nunciature in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> dates from 1511 when <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> sent <a href="../cathen/03223a.htm">Lorenzo Campeggio</a> to the Imperial Court. His mission was ratified in 1513 by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, and from 1530 a nuncio was permanently accredited. The nuncios often accompanied <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>, even when he resided outside the empire. Another German nunciature was established in 1524, when Lorenzo Pimpinella was sent to the court of King Ferdinand of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The first real nuncio in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was Leone Ludovico di Canossa (1514-17). The French nunciature continued from the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>.

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> a number of new nunciatures were erected. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> diplomatic representatives were appointed for <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> (Florence), and for <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, where the nunciature underwent the same development as in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The <em>nuntius</em> entrusted with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of collecting the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> taxes received also diplomatic powers, and was recognized in this capacity by Philip II in 1569. <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> likewise received permanent nuncios shortly after the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. To foster <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> revival new nunciatures were erected in the southern parts of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. Thus, in 1573, Bartolomeo Portia was made nuncio of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, Tyrol, and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, although no further successor was appointed after 1583. In 1580 Germanico Malaspina was appointed first nuncio of <a href="../cathen/14318a.htm">Styria</a>, but this nunciature was discontinued in 1621. Bishop Bonhomini arrived in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> in 1579, and up to 1581 with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and success introduced <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms. In 1586 Giovanni Battista Santonio succeeded him, whereupon the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> nunciature became permanent. In Cologne a nunciature was erected in 1584 for northwestern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and the Rhine, but in 1596 the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> was detached from the Nunciature of Cologne and received its own nuncio, who was to reside in <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> (Nunciature of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>). The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Nunciature of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> extended also the English missions. Thus, toward the end of the sixteenth century, nunciatures were fully developed.



<p>A dispute concerning the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the erecting of nunciatures and the competency of the nuncios themselves arose in 1785, when <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> determined to establish a new nunciature in <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> at the request of Charles Theodore, Elector of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. The elector desired the appointment of a special nuncio, because princes subject to the emperor alone were <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, but did not reside in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, thus greatly impeding the exercise of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration. The three spiritual electors (the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Cologne, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>) protested on the ground that thereby their <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> would be violated. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, however, appointed Zoglio, titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, as nuncio, and to him Charles Theodore ordered his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to have recourse in future in all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters within his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The three electors, imbued with <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">Febronianism</a>, formed a coalition with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, hoping to recover their pretended primitive <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> by ignoring the nuncio and by giving decisions and granting <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> on their own authority, even in cases canonically reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. As <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> refused to support them, they appealed to <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, who, in accordance with his principles, heartily approved of their efforts, pledged them his full support, declared that he would never allow the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the empire to be curtailed, and that consequently he would recognize the nuncios only in their political character. At the Congress of Ems, the three elector <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> passed resolutions embodying their contentions. Despite this protest, <a href="../cathen/11380b.htm">Pacca</a> and Zoglio continued to exercise their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> in <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> and <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> respectively, received appeals from the decisions of <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical courts</a>, and granted <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> in cases reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. On the other hand the four <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> arbitrarily extended their own authority, granting <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> from solemn religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> as well as from matrimonial impediments, and erecting <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunals of third instance. The emperor brought the controversy before the Imperial Diet of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> in 1788, but without definite results. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, opposed both by the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters and the suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, renewed communications with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who on 14 Nov., 1789, issued an extensive document giving a detailed exposition of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and those of its envoys (Ss. D. N. Pii pp. VI. Responsio ad Metropolitanos Moguntino, Treviren., Colonien. et Salisburgen., supre Nuntiaturis apostolicis, Rome, 1789). Frederick William II, King of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, also recognized the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Nuncio of Cologne in the territory of Cleves, and in <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> his ambassadors opposed the pretentions of the emperor. The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French revolution</a> ended the dispute. Owing to the political dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire the Imperial German nunciature became the Austrian nunciature, when Francis II assumed the title of Emperor of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The partition of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> ended the nunciature there. The first state outside of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to receive a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> representative was <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>. At first an internuncio was assigned to that country, but of late years a nuncio has resided there.

<p>At present there are four <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> nunciatures of the first class, four of the second, two internunciatures, and several delegations. The nunciatures of the first class are: (1) <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>; (2) <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where the nunciature was re-established after the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, after Cardinal Caprara had first been sent thither as <em>legatus a latere</em> by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>. Since the rupture of diplomatic relations between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in 1904, this office has had no incumbent; (3) <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, which, since the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, has been the permanent residence of the papal nuncio for <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. It has a special tribunal, the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a>, which serves only as a court of appeals from the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> courts, but cannot handle any cases of first instance. Litigants are free to appeal from its decisions to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>; (4) <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, which had at first a nunciature only of the second class. It included a special court for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, but this was abolished in the beginning of the nineteenth century. From the second half of the sixteenth century <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> always had a nuncio, although disputes arose at different times. The nunciatures of the second class are: (1) the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> nunciature which, in the eighteenth century, comprised the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, Basle, Ciore, <a href="../cathen/14014c.htm">Sion</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a>. Since the religious troubles of 1873 there has been no incumbent; (2) since the beginning of the nineteenth century the only nunciature in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> has been that of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> (the last nuncio of Cologne was Annibale della Genga, later on <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Pope Leo XII</a>); (3) <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, the residence of the Nuncio of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> as successor of the former Nuncio of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. During the time of the French occupation this position was vacant. It was only in 1829 that Coppacini was sent to <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> as internuncio; in 1841, it was again raised to a nunciature. Fornari, the first nuncio, was succeeded in 1843 by Gioacchino Pecci, afterwards <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. In 1880 the Liberal Ministry severed all diplomatic relations with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; the old status was restored, when in 1885 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party regained power; (4) <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>. In 1807 Lorenzo Caleppi, the Nuncio of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, followed John VI in his flight to <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>. In 1829 a special internuncio, Felice Ostini, was appointed for <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>; this marks the beginning of diplomatic relations between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the other states of South America. In 1902 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Internuncio of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> was raised to the dignity of nuncio.

<p>The internunciatures are: (1) the Internunciature of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and Luxemburg. Since the separation of these countries, the internuncio receives distinct credential letters for the two governments. From the time of the Peace Conference at the Hague <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> has only a charg&eacute; d'affaires; (2) the Internunciature of <a href="../cathen/01702d.htm">Argentina</a>, <a href="../cathen/15230c.htm">Uruguay</a>, and Paraguay, which was erected in 1900. There had been accredited to these countries a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> delegate since 1847, and an internuncio, Mgr. Barili, had been sent in 1851 to what was then <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">New Granada</a>. The Apostolic delegates form a lower rank of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> representatives of diplomatic and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> character. There are five Apostolic Delegations in South and Central America: (1) <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>, (2) Columbia, (3) Costa-Rica, (4) <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>, <a href="../cathen/02627a.htm">Bolivia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, (5) San Domingo, <a href="../cathen/07114a.htm">Haiti</a> and Venezuela, all erected during the nineteenth century. Owing to repeated religious troubles these delegations have often been vacant. Costa-Rica has been without a delegate for a considerable period. It is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to distinguish these Apostolic delegations of a diplomatic character from those which are merely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>.

<p>The powers to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> nuncios correspond to the two-fold character of their mission. As the diplomatic representatives of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, they treat with the sovereigns or head of republics to whom they are accredited. With their mission they are given special credentials as well as special instructions, whether of a public or of a private nature. They also receive a secret code and enjoy the same privileges as ambassadors. Their appearances in public are regulated in conformity with general diplomatic customs. They also have certain distinctions, especially that of being ex-officio dean of the entire diplomatic body, within their nunciature, and therefore on public occasions take precedence of all diplomatic representatives. Internuncio and delegates enjoy a similar right of precedence over all other diplomatic representatives of equal rank. This privilege of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> envoys was expressly recognized by the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1815 and is universally observed. Nuncios enjoy the title of "Excellency" and the same special honours as ambassadors. In addition to their diplomatic position nuncios have an <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>. The latter point is especially stated in the "Responsio" of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> to the Rhenish <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, and was reaffirmed by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in a letter to <a href="../cathen/04634b.htm">Archbishop Darboy</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1863, as also in a declaration of the Cardinal Secretary of State Jacobini addressed to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 15 April, 1885. The ample <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> faculties, granted in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> <em>a latere</em> and other <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> envoys, had led to abuses; the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, therefore, enacted that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> envoys (legati a latere, nuncii, gubernatores ecclesiastici, aut alii quarumcumque facultatum vigore) were not to impede <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or to disturb their ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> nor to proceed against <a href="../cathen/11727a.htm">ecclesiastical persons</a> until the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had first been applied to and had shown himself negligent (Sess. XXIV, cap. xx de ref.).

<p>Apart from the special faculties in conferring <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> and in granting spiritual favours, the nuncios had the power of instituting proceedings and giving decisions in cases of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration and discipline reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The nunciatures had special courts, principally for cases of appeal. Today such a court is attached only to the Nunciature of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In all other points nuncios enjoy essentially the same <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters. They are the representatives of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and as such are the organs through which he exercises his ordinary and immediate supreme <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. It is their special <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to supervise <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration, and on this they report to the cardinal secretary of state; they grant <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> in cases reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, carry on the process of information for the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, give permission for reading forbidden books, and enjoy the privilege of granting minor <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. In special cases they are delegated for the settlement of important <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. In virtue of their position certain <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> honours are due to them as laid down in the "C&aelig;remoniale Episcoporum". <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> introduced a change in the practice hitherto followed with regard to nuncios, so that now they hold their position longer than formerly, and a nuncio of the first class, after his recall, is not regularly raised to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>.
<h2>Nunciature reports</h2>

<p>The official reports concerning their entire field of work sent by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> nuncios and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> (or their representatives) to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or the cardinal secretary of state. The contents of these dispatches are in accordance with the commission received by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> or nuncio. The reports of the nuncios filling permanent nunciatures, on whom rested the protection of all the interests of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> within their special territory, relate to all the more important <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or political questions which had any connexion whatever with their commission. The objects of the reports are: (1) to give the most exact information possible concerning all political and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> occurrences which might be of importance to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or the cardinal secretary of state; (2) to give exact information concerning the action the nuncios have taken with respect to such occurrences; (3) to send news concerning the princes to whose courts they are accredited, and concerning the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are in personal contact with the princes, or appear at court on account of political matters, or in any way have a share in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and political affairs. In doing this attention is naturally paid both to the instructions that had been given to the nuncio before he left for his post, and to the letters regularly received from the office of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> secretary of state, from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, or from other officials. Taken in a wider sense, nunciature reports also include those letters of the nuncios concerning the affairs of their nunciatures, addressed to <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> or others having high official rank in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>. From the first half of the sixteenth century, when the bureau of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> secretary of state was fully developed and the permanent nunciatures received their ultimate organization, the reports of the nuncios were sent regularly (from the middle of the sixteenth century, often weekly). They were written sometimes in Latin, sometimes in Italian. If important matters were treated, especially those concerning which negotiations needed to be carried on in the most secret manner possible, the nuncio employed the cipher given him before going to this position. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<p>Although the individual dispatches vary greatly in worth, yet, as a whole, the nunciature reports form a very important source from the sixteenth century (especially during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries) both for the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> and for political history. Only a very small proportion either of the reports made by <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> in the second half of the fiteenth century or in the early years of the sixteenth century have been preserved. From the second decade of the sixteenth century a much greater number survive, and from the middle of this century the reports of individual nuncios frequently exist in unbroken sequence. Most of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> reports are in the Vatican archives, and are classified in sixteen series, according to the nunciatures. The classification does not agree, however, with the present arrangement of the nunciatures, the series given being as follows: <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (the imperial nunciature), <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and Malta. Individual reports are also in other divisions of the archives. The nunciature reports brought together in the archives of the Vatican show serious gaps, especially for the sixteenth century. The reason is that the diplomatic correspondence of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> in that era was not systematically brought together and preserved in a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> archive, but was frequently purloined by the copyists, cardinal favourites, and their secretaries, just as the letters dispatched from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were retained by the nuncios and their heirs, and thus became dispersed to some extent in <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> archives. For example, the greater part of the nunciature reports pertaining to the reign of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> (1534-49) are now in the state archives of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, to which they came along with the archives of the Farnese <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Other collections of reports are to be found in various Italian archives. The reports preserved are either the original drafts made by the nuncios themselves, or the original letters drawn up in accordance with these, or copies of the original letters. As regards the reports written in cipher, a key can generally be found. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<p>On account of the great historical importance of the reports an effort has been made, since the opening of the Vatican archives for general research, to publish these together with supplementary documents (especially the instructions and letters sent to the nuncios). Heretofore more has been done, in the way of publication, for the German nunciature than for the others. H. L&#228;mmer published a series of nunciature reports from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> as early as 1800 in his "Monumenta Vaticana historiam ecclesiasticum s&aelig;culi XVI illustrantia"; upon the opening of the Vatican archives, the assistant archivist, Father Balan, brought out further material pertaining to the same subject in his work "Monumenta reformationis Lutheran&aelig;" (Ratisbon, 1883-4). Father Dittrich treats the reports sent by the nuncio Giovanni Morone from the Diet of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> (1541) in the "Historisches Jahrbuch der G&ouml;rresgesellschaft", IV (1883), 395-472, 618-73, and, as a complement to this, edited the "Nuntiaturberichte Morones vom deutschen K&ouml;nigshofe" for the years 1539-40 in "Quellen und Forschungen aus dem Gebiete der Geschichte", I (Paderborn, 1892). In the mean time three historical institutes at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a>, the Austrian, and that of the G&ouml;rresgesellschaft) divided among them the publication of all the nunciature reports sent from the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> for the period of the sixteenth and the first half of the seventeenth centuries. These <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> have already published a large number of volumes: the first division, extending to 1559, is being published by the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Institute; there have appeared so far vols. I-IV, VIII-X, and XII, comprising the nunciatures of <a href="../cathen/15353b.htm">Vergerio</a>, Morone, Migganelli, Varallo, Poggio, Bertano, and Camiani, the legations of Farnese, Cervini, Campegio, Aleander, and Sfondrato (Gotha-Berlin, 1892&mdash;). The second division covering the period 1560-72, was undertaken by the Austrian Institute; up to the present vols I and III, containing the reports of the nuncios <a href="../cathen/07473a.htm">Hosius</a> and Belfino, have appeared (Vienna, 1897-1903). A third division, covering the years 1572-85, was also assigned to the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> institute which has already issued this series (Berlin, 1892&mdash;); vol. I, containing the struggle over Cologne; vol. II, containing the Diets of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> (1576) and of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> (1582); vols. III-V, containing the nunciature of Bartolom&aelig;us of Portia. At this point begin the publications of the Institute of the G&ouml;rresgesellschaft, which has so far edited in four volumes the reports of the nuncios Bonomi (Bonhomini), Santonio, Frangipani, Malaspina, and Sega, and the nunciature correspondence of Caspar Gropper (Paderborn, 1895&mdash;). The period assigned to this institute covers 1585-1605. With 1606 begins another period (the fourth division), assigned to the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Institute and covering the seventeenth century. Of this division two volumes have been published containing the reports of the nuncio Paletto (Berlin, 1895&mdash;). In this way the material concerning the German nunciatures for the period from the beginning of the sixteenth to the middle of the seventeenth century, that is for the age of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, will be available at a not far distant date. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<p>Professors Reinhard and Steffens of Fribourg undertook the editing of the nunciature reports for <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> and began with Nuncio Bonomi (Bonhomini), of whose reports one volume has been issued (Solothurn, 1907); the introductory volume completed by Steffens after Reinhard's death has since appeared (Solothurn, 1910). As regard other countries the reports of the nuncio Andrea da Burgo, who was in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> during the years 1524-6, have been issued in the "Monumenta Vaticana Hungari&aelig;", second series, vol I: "Relationes oratorum pontificiorum" (Budapest, 1884). For <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the publication of the nunciature reports has been begun in the "Archives de l'histoire religieusede France"; of this Fraikin undertook the nunciatures during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> and has issued so far vol. I (Paris, 1906), covering the years 1525-7, and including the nunciatures of Capino da Capo and Roberto Acciainolo, and the legation of Cardinal Salviati. Ancel, meanwhile, began the nunciatures during the reign of <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, and edited (vol. I, pt. i) the dispatches of Sebastiano Gualterio and Cesare Brancato (1554-7). The general reports of Ottavio Mirto Frangipani and Fabio della Lionessa, the nuncios in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> (1605 and 1634), have been published by Cauchie in the "Analectes pour servir &#224; l'histoire eccl&eacute;siastique de la Belgique" (Louvain). The publication of the dispatches of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> nunciature in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> has been commenced by Hinojosa, "Los Despachos de la Diplomacia Pontificia en Espa&ntilde;a", I (Madrid, 1896). So far no comprehensive publication of this kind has been undertaken for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, although individual reports have been published. Tolomei has treated the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> nunciature during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>, "La nunziatura di Venezia nel pontificato di Clemente VII" (Turin, 1892), and Cursi has edited the dispatches that have been preserved of the legation of Giacomo Gherardi, "Dispacci e lettere di Giac. Gherardi, nunzio pontificio a Firenze e Milano, 11 settembre, 1487-10 ottobre, 1490", in "Studi e Testi", fasc. xxi (Rome, 1909). Besides these comprehensive publications various historians in treating the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in their works have made use of and published individual dispatches of this kind.
