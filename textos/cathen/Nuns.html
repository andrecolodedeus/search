<h2 id="section1">Origin and history</h2>

<p>The institution of nuns and sisters, who devote themselves in various <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders to the practice of a life of perfection, dates from the first ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> may claim with a certain <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> that they were the first to embrace the religious state for its own sake, without regard to missionary work and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions proper to men. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> speaks of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, who were called to certain kinds of church work (<a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#vrs9">1 Timothy 5:9</a>), and of virgins (<a href="../bible/1co007.htm">1 Corinthians 7</a>), whom he praises for their continence and their devotion to the things of the Lord. The virgins were remarkable for their perfect and perpetual chastity which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Apologists have extolled as a contrast to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> corruption (<a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a>, "Apol.", I, c. 15; <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, "P.G.", VI, 350; <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, "De Virginibus", Bk. I, C. 4; <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, "P.L.", XVI, 193). Many also practiced poverty. From the earliest times they were called the spouses of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>, the custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ("Apol. ad Constant.", sec. 33; <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, "P.G.", XXV, 639). <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> describes a virgin who had broken her <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> as an adulteress ("Ep. 62", <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, "P.L.", IV, 370). <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> distinguishes between those virgins who took the veil publicly in the assembly of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and others known to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone; the veil seems to have been simply that of married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Virgins vowed to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, at first continued to live with their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, but as early as the end of the third century there were community houses known as <em>partheuones</em>; and certainly at the beginning of the same century the virgins formed a special class in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, receiving <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> before the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. The office of <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> in which the virgins are mentioned after the porters, and the <a href="../cathen/09291a.htm">Litany of the Saints</a>, in which they are invoked with the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, shows traces of this classification. They were sometimes admitted among the <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a> for the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of adult <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and to exercise the functions which St. Paul had reserved for <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> of sixty years.

<p>When the persecutions of the third century drove many into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, the solitary life produced many heroines; and when the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> began to live in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, there were also communities of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. <a href="../cathen/11381a.htm">St. Pachomius</a> (292-346) built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in which a number of religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> lived with his sister. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> made famous the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">St. Paula</a> at Bethlehem. St. Augustine addressed to the nuns a letter of direction from which subsequently his rule was taken. There were <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of virgins or nuns at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and the West. The great founders or reformers of monastic or more generally <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, saw their rules adopted by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The nuns of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> cut their hair, a practice not introduced until later into the West. Monasteries of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were generally situated at a distance from those of men; <a href="../cathen/11381a.htm">St. Pachomius</a> insisted on this separation, also St. Benedict. There were, however, common houses, one wing being set apart for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and the other for men, more frequently adjoining houses for the two sexes. Justinian abolished these double houses in the East, placed an old man to look after the temporal affairs of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, and appointed a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> who were to perform their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, but not to hold any other communication with the nuns. In the West, such double houses existed among the hospitallers even in the twelfth century. In the eighth and ninth centuries a number of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the principal churches of the West, without being bound by <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>, chose to live in community and to observe a fixed rule of life. This canonical life was led also by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who retired form the world, took <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of chastity, dressed modestly in black, but were not bound to give of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Continence and a certain <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> were required of married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> whose husbands were in Sacred Orders, or even received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>.

<p>Hence in the ninth century the list of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> vowed to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> included these various classes: virgins, whose solemn <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> was reserved to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, nuns bound by <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>, <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a> engaged in the service of the church, and wives or <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> of men in Sacred Orders. The nuns sometimes occupied a special house; the enclosure strictly kept in the East, was not considered indispensable in the West. Other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> allowed the nuns to go in and out. In Gaul and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> lasted one year for the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a> nuns and three years for the others. In early times the nuns gave <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, young girls brought by their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and especially girls intending to embrace a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. Besides those who took the veil of virgins of their own accord, or decided to embrace the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, there were others who were offered by their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> by their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> before they were old enough to be consulted. In the West under the discipline in force for several centuries, these oblates were considered as bound for life by the offering made by their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. The profession itself might be expressed or implied. One who put on the religious habit, and lived for some time among the professed, was herself considered as professed. Besides the taking of the veil and simple profession there was also a solemn <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of virginity which took place much later, at twenty-five years. In the thirteenth century, the Mendicant Orders appeared characterized by a more rigorous poverty, which excluded not only private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, but also the possession of certain kinds of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in common. Under the direction of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, <a href="../cathen/04004a.htm">St. Clare</a> founded in 1212 the Second Order of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> had given a constitution to nuns, even before instituting his <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Friars Preachers</a>, approved 22 December, 1216. The <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Hermits of St. Augustine</a> also had corresponding orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; and the same was the case with the <a href="../cathen/04051d.htm">Clerks Regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the sixteenth century, except the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>.



<p>From the time of the Mendicant Orders, founded specially for preaching and missionary work, there was a great difference between the orders of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, arising from the strict enclosure to which <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were subjected. This rigorous enclosure usual in the East, was imposed on all nuns in the West, first by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and particular councils, and afterwards by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. <a href="../cathen/02661c.htm">Boniface VII</a> (1294-1309) by his constitution "Periculoso", inserted in Canon Law [c. un, De statu regularium, in VI (III, 16)] made it an inviolable law for all professed nuns; and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (sess. XXV, De Reg. et Mon., c. v) confirmed that constitution. Hence it was impossible for religious to undertake <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> incompatible with the enclosure. The <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of young girls alone was permitted to them, and that under somewhat inconvenient conditions. It was also impossible for them to organize on the lines of the Mendicant Orders, that is to say to have a superior general over several houses and members attached to a province rather than to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The difficulty was sometimes avoided by having tertiary sisters, bound only by simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and dispensed from the enclosure. The <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> commemorates the services rendered the Order of Mercy by <a href="../cathen/09753c.htm">St. Mary of Cervellione</a>. <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a> took more radical measures by his constitution "Circa pastoralis", of 25 May, 1566. Not only did he insist on the observance of the constitution of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, but compelled the tertiaries to accept the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> with the pontifical enclosure. For nearly three centuries the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> refused all <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> bound by simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> by his constitution "Pastoralis" of 31 May, 1631 abolished an <a href="../cathen/08054a.htm">English teaching congregation</a>, founded by <a href="../cathen/15551c.htm">Mary Ward</a> in 1609, which had simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and a superior general.

<p>This strictness led to the foundation of pious associations called secular because they had no perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and leading a common life intended for their own personal sanctification and the practice of charity, e.g. the Daughters of Charity, founded by <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>. The constitution of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a> was not always strictly observed; communities existed approved by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and soon tolerated by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, new ones were formed with the sanctions of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> authorities. So great were the services rendered by these new communities to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, the sick, the young, and even the missions, that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> expressly confirmed several constitutions, but for a long time refused to confirm the congregations themselves, and the formula of commendation or ratification contained this restriction <em>citra tamen approbationem conservatorii</em> (without <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the congregation). As political difficulties rendered less easy the observance of solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, especially for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> from the end of the eighteenth century declined to approve any new congregations with solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and even suppressed in certain countries, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, all solemn professions in the old orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The constitution of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, "Quamvis justo" of 30 April, 1749, on the subject of the Congregation of English Virgins was the prelude to the legislation of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, who by his constitution "Conditae" of 8 December, 1900, laid down the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> common to congregations with simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, dividing these into two great classes, congregations under <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> authority, subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and those under pontifical law.
<h2 id="section2">Various kinds of nuns</h2>

<p>(1) As regards their <em>object</em> they may be purely contemplative, seeking personal perfection by close union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; such are most of the strictly enclosed congregations, as <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> Canonesses, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, Collettines, <a href="../cathen/12682b.htm">Redemptoristines</a>; or they may combine this with the practice of <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>, foreign missions, like the White Sisters of <a href="../cathen/09050d.htm">Cardinal Lavigerie</a>, and certain <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Tertiaries; the eduction of young girls, like the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> and Visitandines; the care of the sick, <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, lunatics, and aged <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, like many of the congregations called <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a>, Sisters of Charity, Daughters of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>. When the works of mercy are corporal, and above all carried on outside the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, the congregations are called active. Teaching communities are classed rather among those leading a mixed life, devoting themselves to works which in themselves require union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and contemplation. The constitution "Conditae" of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (8 December, 1900) charges <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> not to permit sisters to open houses as hotels for the entertainment of strangers of both sexes, and to be extremely careful in authorizing congregations which live on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, or nurse sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> at their homes, or maintain infirmaries for the reception of inform <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of both sexes, or sick <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, by its Regulations (Normae) of 28 June, 1901, declares that it does not approve of congregations whose object is to render certain services in <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> or colleges for male pupils, or to teach children or young people of both sexes; and it disapproves their undertaking the direct care of young infants, or lying-in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. These services should be given only in exceptional circumstances.

<p>(2) As regards their <em>origin</em>, congregations are either connected with a first order or congregation of men, as in the case of most of the older congregations, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Reformed <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> of La Trappe, <a href="../cathen/12682b.htm">Redemptoristines</a> etc., or are founded independently, like the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, Visitandines, and recent institution. In the regulations of 28 June, 1901, Art. 19, 52, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> no longer approves of double foundations, which establish a certain subordination of the sisters to similar congregations of men.

<p>(3) As regards their <em>juridical condition</em>, we distinguish (a) nuns properly so-called, having solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> with <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> enclosure, whose homes are <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; (b) nuns belonging to the old approved orders with solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, but taking only simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> by special <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; (c) sisters with simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> dependent on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; (d) sisters under <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> government. The house of sisters under simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and the congregations themselves are canonically called <em>conservatoria.</em> These do not always fulfil all the essential conditions of the religious state. Those which do are more correctly called religious congregations than the others, which are called <em>piae congregationes, piae societates</em> (pious congregations or <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>.) Nuns of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> only are considered here.
<h2 id="section3">Nuns properly so called</h2>

<p>Nuns properly so-called have solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> with a strict enclosure, regulated by pontifical law which prevents the religious from going out (except in very rare cases, approved by the regular superior and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>), and also the entrance of strangers, even <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>, under pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. Even admission to the grated parlor is not free, and interviews with regulars are subject to stringent rules. Though some mitigations have been introduced partly by local usage, partly (in the case of certain <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in America) by express concession of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The building should be so arranged that the inner courts and gardens cannot be overlooked from outside, and the windows should not open on the public road. By the fact of their enclosure, these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are independent of one another. At the head of the community is a superior often called the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>, appointed for life by the chapter, at least outside <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, for in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and especially in the two Sicilies, the constitution "Exposcit debitum" (1 January, 1583) of <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> requires that hey should be re-elected every three years (see "Periodicade Religiosis", n. 420, vol. 4, 158). The election must be confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> to whom the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is subject, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or the regular <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> presides over the ballot, except in the case of nuns subject to regulars, and he has always the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to be present at the election. The president collects the votes at the grating. Without having <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> exercises authority over all in the house, and commands in virtue of their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. Monasteries not exempt are subject to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; exempt <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are placed, some under the immediate authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, others under that of a regular First Order. In the absence of any other formal direction, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is understood to delegate to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the annual <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">visitation</a> of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, to the exclusion of other superiors. This visitation is made by the regular <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> in the case of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> dependent on a First Order; but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has in all cases authority to insist on the maintenance of the enclosure, and to control the temporal administration; he also approves the confessors.

<p>The erection of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> requires the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and (at least in practice nowadays) of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, by himself, or in consultation with the regular superior, determines the number of nuns who can be received according to the amount of their ordinary revenues. The recent Council of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Latin America, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1899, required that the number should not be less than twelve. It is sometimes permitted to receive a certain number of supernumeraries who pay a double dowry, never less than four hundred crowns, and remain supernumeraries all their lives. According to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 23 May, 1659, candidates must be at least fifteen years old. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Sanctissimus" of 4 January, 1910, annuls the admission to the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> or to any <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, if granted without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, of pupils expelled for any grave reason from a secular <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, or for any reason whatever from any institution preparatory to the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, or of former <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> or professed sisters expelled from their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. Professed sisters dispensed from their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> cannot, without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, enter any congregation, but the one they have quitted (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">NOVICE</a>; <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">POSTULANT</a>; "Periodicade Religiosis", n. 368, vol. 5, 98). The admission is made by the chapter, but, before the clothing, and also before the solemn profession, it is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, by himself or (if he is prevented) by his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> or some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> delegated by either of them, to inquire into the question of the candidate's <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">religious vocation</a>, and especially as to her freedom of choice. The candidate must provide a dowry of at least two hundred crowns unless the founder consents to accept a smaller sum. With certain exceptions, the dowry of choir sisters cannot be dispensed with; it must be paid before the clothing, and invested in some safe and profitable manner. On solemn profession, it becomes the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, which has, however, no right of alienation; it is returned as a matter of equity to a religious who enters another order, or to one who returns to the world and is in want.

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> the religious cannot at first, according to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Perpensis" of 3 May, 1902, take any but simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> whether perpetual or for a year only, if it is customary to take annual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. The admission to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> is made by the chapter, with the consent of the regular superior or the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Some writers hold that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is bound, before this profession, to make a fresh inquiry into the vocation of the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a>, and this inquiry does not dispense from that which the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> prescribes before solemn profession (see the answer of 19 January, 1909; "Periodicade Religiosis", n. 317, vol. 4, 341.) This period of simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> ordinarily lasts for three years, but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or the regular <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> may prolong it in the case of nuns who are under twenty-five years. During this period, the religious keeps her <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, but makes over the administration of it to any one she may choose. She is bound to the rules and the choir, but not to the private recitation of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>; she can take part in chapters, except in those in which others are admitted to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>; she cannot be elected superior, mother-vicaress, mistress of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, assistant, counsellor, or treasurer. She participates in all the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> and spiritual privileges of those who have taken their solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>; and although the solemnly professed take precedence, once the solemn profession is made, the seniority is regulated by the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of simple profession, without regard to any delay in proceeding to solemn profession. The <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> of <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and dismissal of nuns are reserved to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The outward solemnity of profession takes place at the first simple profession, the other takes place without any solemnity. Only the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> or the ordinary can admit to the latter, but a consultative chapter is held, whose decision is announced by the superior. Solemn profession carries with it the inability to possess <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> (except in case of a <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">papal indult</a> such as that enjoyed by <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and perhaps <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>), annuls a marriage previously contracted but not consummated, and creates a diriment impediment to any subsequent marriage. Nuns are generally <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to recite the Divine office, like <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of men; but the Visitandines and some <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> recite only the <a href="../cathen/09294a.htm">Little Office of the Blessed Virgin</a>, even in choir. The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of this office, even choral, does not bind under pain of mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> has declared for the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>; whether it can be omitted without venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> depends apparently upon the constitutions.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> appoints the ordinary confessor, also the extraordinary or additional confessors of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> subject to him, and approves the confessor nominated by the regular <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> subject to a First Order. The <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> for one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is not valid for another. As a rule there should be only one ordinary confessor, who should be changed every three years. Since the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXV De Reg., c. x), a confessor extraordinary should visit the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> two or three times a year. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, by his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Pastoralis" of 5 August, 1748, insisted on the appointment of a confessor extraordinary, and also on the provision of facilities for sick nuns. More recently, the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Quem ad modum" of 17 October, 1890, ordains that, without asking for any reason, a superior shall allow her subjects to confess to any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> among those authorized by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, as often as they think it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for their spiritual necessities. Besides the ordinary or extraordinary confessors, there are additional confessors, of whom the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must appoint a sufficient number. The ordinary confessor cannot be a religious except for <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the same order as himself; and in that case the extraordinary confessor cannot belong to the same order. The same <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> gives to confessors the exclusive right of regulating the communions of the nuns, who have the privilege of communicating daily since the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Sacra Tridentina" of 20 December, 1905 (see "Periodicade Religiosis", n 110, vol. 2, 66), and it forbids superiors to interfere unasked in questions of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. The subjects are free to open their minds to their superiors but the later must not, directly or indirectly, demand or invite such confidence.
<h2 id="section4">Nuns of the old orders without solemn vows</h2>

<p>Since the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, various answers of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> have gradually made it clear that neither in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> nor in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> are there any longer <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> subject to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> enclosure, or bound by solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. (Cf. for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the reply of the Penitentiary of 23 December, 1835; for <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> the declaration of the <a href="../cathen/15483a.htm">Apostolic visitor</a> Corselis of 1836; Bizzarri, "Collectanea, 1st ed., p. 504, note; <a href="../cathen/02711e.htm">Bouix</a>, "De regularibus", vol. 2, 123 sq.). After long deliberation, the Sacred Congregation of Bishops and Regulars decided (cf. letter of 2 September, 1864, to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>) that in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> nuns were under simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> only, except the Visitandines of Georgetown, <a href="../cathen/10410a.htm">Mobile</a>, Kaskaskia, St. Louis, and Baltimore, who made solemn profession by virtue of special <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescripts</a>. It added that without special <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> should be simple in all <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> erected in the future. Since then the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Kaskaskia has been suppressed. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> permitted the erection of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Visitandines with solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> at <a href="../cathen/14236c.htm">Springfield</a> (Missouri). According to the same letter, the Visitandines with solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> must pass five years of simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> before proceeding to solemn profession (Bizzarri, "Collectanea", 1st ed., 778-91). Except in the case of a <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">pontifical indult</a> placing them in subjection to a first order these nuns are bound by the following rules: (a) The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has full <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over them; he may dispense from all constitutions not reserved to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and from particular impediments to admission, but may not modify the constitutions. The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are reserved to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have received power to dispense from all <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> except that of chastity. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> presides and confirms all elections, and has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to require an account of the temporal administration. (b) The superior retains such power as is adapted to the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and the necessities of community life. (c) The <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> is such as imposed by the rule; the enclosure is of episcopal law. (d) The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty does not prevent the possession of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. As a rule, disposition of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> "inter vivos" and by will cannot be licitly made without the consent of the superior or the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Unless forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the superior may permit the execution of such instruments as are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the purpose. (e) <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> and spiritual privileges (among which may be reckoned the use of a special calendar) remain intact. (f) In principle, the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of the First Order is without authority over the nuns.
<h2 id="section5">Religious congregations and pious societies under pontifical authority</h2>
<h3 id="A">Congregations</h3>

<p>Since the constitution "Conditae" of 8 December, 1900, and the Regulations of 28 June, 1901, we possess precise rules by which to distinguish the congregations governed by pontifical law. Before formally approving a congregation and its constitutions, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is accustomed to give its commendation first to the intentions of its founders and the purpose of the foundation, and then to the congregation itself. The second <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of commendation has the effect of bringing the congregation into the number of those which are governed by pontifical law, and especially by the second part of the constitution "Conditae". Bizzarri in his "Collectanea" gives a list of congregations so commended up to 1864 (1st ed., 864 sqq.). This <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> is not usually granted until the congregation has existed for some time under the authority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The congregations are constituted on the model of the newer <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, that is to say they group several houses, each governed by a local superior, under the indirect authority of a superior general; many, but not all, are divided into provinces. Many form communities of tertiaries, who as such have a share in the spiritual privileges of the order to which they are affiliated. Except in the case of a special privilege, like that which places the Daughters of Charity under the Superior General of the Priests of the Mission (see <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 25 May, 1888) the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> no longer permits a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or the delegate of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or the superior general of a congregation of men to be superior over a congregation of sisters. Before the regulations of 1901 the rules of new congregations differed in many respects. The details of internal government which follow apply to newly established congregations rather than to older ones, like the Ladies of the Sacred Heart.

<p>The government of the congregations is vested in the general chapter, and in the superior general assisted by a council with certain <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> reserved to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, under protection and supreme direction of the Sacred Congregation of Religious. This is the only competent Congregation since the reform of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> by the constitution "Sapienti" of 29 June, 1908. The general chapter includes in all cases the superior general, her counsellors, the secretary general, the treasurer general, and if the congregation is divided into provinces, the provincial superiors, and two delegates from each province, elected by the provincial chapter. If there are no provinces, the general chapter includes (besides those mentioned above) all superiors of houses containing more than twelve nuns, accompanied by one religious under perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> elected by all the professed sisters (including those under temporary <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>) of such houses. The less important houses are grouped among themselves for this election, or annexed to a principal house. This chapter ordinarily meets every six or twelve years, being summoned by the superior general or mother vicaress; but an extraordinary meeting may be called on the occurrence in the vacancy in the office of superior, or for any other grave reason approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The general chapter elects by an absolute majority of votes in secret ballot the superior general, the counsellors or assistants general, the secretary general, and the treasurer general, and deliberates on important matters affecting the congregation. In many cases especially when there is a question of modifying the constitutions, the permission and confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> are required. The capitular decrees remain in force till the next chapter. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as delegate of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, presides over the elections in person or by his representative. After the ballot he declares the election valid, and announces the result. The provincial chapter, composed of the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a>, the superiors of houses containing at least twelve nuns, and a delegate from each provincial house (as above) has no office, according to <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>, but to depute two sisters to the general chapter.

<p>The superior general is elected for six or twelve years; in the former case she may be re-elected but for a third consecutive term of six years, or a second of twelve years, she must receive two-thirds of the votes, and the consent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. She may not resign her office except with the consent of the Sacred Congregation, which has the power to depose her. The house in which she resides is considered the mother-house, and the permission of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for a change of residence. She governs the congregation according to the approved constitutions, and is bound to make a visitation either personally or by a deputy, to exercise a general control over the temporal administration, and to submit to the Sacred Congregation an official report countersigned by the <a href="../cathen/11284b.htm">ordinary</a> of the principal house. (See the instruction accompanying the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 16 July, 1906, "Periodicade Religiosis", n. 124, vol. 2, 128 sqq.). The superior general nominates to the different non-elective offices, and decides the place of residence of all her subjects. The counsellors general assist the superior general with their advice, and in many mattes the consent of the majority is required. Two of them must live with the superior general, and the rest must be accessible. According to the regulations of 1901, the approval of the general council is required for the erection and suppression of houses, the erection and transfer of novitiates, the erection of new provinces, the principal nominations, the retention of a local superior for longer than the usual term of office, the dismissal of a sister or <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a>, the deposition of a superior, mistress of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> or counsellor, the provisional appointment of a counsellor deceased or deprived of office, the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of a visitor not a member of the council, the choice of a meeting place of the general chapter, the change of residence of the superior general, the execution of all contracts, the auditing of accounts, all pecuniary engagements, the sale or mortgage of immovable <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and the sale of moveable <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of great value. For an election there must be a full meeting of the council, and provision must be made to replace any members who are prevented from attending. In case of a tie, the superior has a casting vote.

<p>The secretary general keeps the minutes of proceedings, and has charge of the archives. The treasurer general administers the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the whole congregation. The provinces and the houses have also their own <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> insists that the safes containing valuables shall have three locks, the keys of which shall be kept by the superior, the treasurer, and the oldest of the counsellors. In her administration the treasurer must be guided by the complicated rules of the recent instruction "inter ca" of 30 July, 1909, which refer especially to pecuniary engagements. The consent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is required before any liability can be incurred exceeding ten thousand francs, and in case of smaller liabilities than this but still of any considerable amount, the superiors must take the advice of their councils. A council should at once be appointed if there is none already existing (cf. "Periodicade Religiosis", n. 331, vol. 5, 11 sqq.). The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must test the vocation of <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a> before they take the veil, and before profession; he presides over chapters of election, permits or forbids collections from door to door; is responsible for the observance of partial enclosure, such as is compatible with the objects of the congregation. No house can be established without his consent. To him also belongs the supreme <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> of the communities, and the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and confessors. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> reserves to itself the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, even temporary ones. The dismissal of a professed sister under perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> must be ratified by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The dismissal of a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> or of a professed sister under temporary <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> is within the power of the general council, if justified by grave reasons; but this dismissal does not relieve from <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> for which recourse must be had to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> alone can authorize the suppression of houses, the erection or transfer of a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, the erection of a province, the transfer of a mother-house, and any important alienations of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and borrowings above a certain sum.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> permits, though it does not make <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, the division of a community into choir sisters or teaching sisters, and lay sisters. Though not opposed to the formation of associations which help the work of the congregation and have a share in its merits, it forbids the establishment of new third orders. A period of temporary <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> should precede the taking of perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. Such is the general law. At the expiration of the term, temporary <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> must be renewed. The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty does not generally forbid the acquisition and retention of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, but only its free use and disposal. A dowry is generally required, of which the community receives the income only, until the death of the sister, and the fruits of their labours belong entirely to the congregation. The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of chastity creates only a prohibitory impediment to marriage. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> generally regulate the confessions of the religious under simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, by the same rules as those of nuns in strict enclosure; but in public churches sisters may go to any approved confessor. In all that concerns communions and direction of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, the decrees "Quem ad modum" and "Sacra Tridentina" apply to these congregations as well as to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of nuns. These religious congregations have not generally any <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of choir, but recite the <a href="../cathen/09294a.htm">Little Office of the Blessed Virgin</a> and other <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. They are bound to make a daily meditation of at least half an hour in the morning, sometimes of another half hour in the evening, and an annual retreat of eight days.
<h3 id="B">Pious societies</h3>

<p>Pious societies, which can only be called congregations by a wide extension of the word, are those which have no perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, such as the Daughters of Charity, who are free for one day in each year, or those which, if they have perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, have no outward sign by which they can be recognized: this single fact is sufficient to deprive them of the character of religious congregations (see answer of 11 August, 1889, "De Religiosis Institutis", vol. 2, n. 13).
<h2 id="section6">Diocesan congregations</h2>

<p>For a long time the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had great latitude in approving new congregations, and gave canonical existence to various <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>. In order to avoid an excessive increase in their number, <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> by his <em>Motu Proprio</em> "Dei Providentis" of 16 July, 1906, required the previous authorization of the Sacred Congregation before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> could establish, or allow to be established any new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> institution; and the Sacred Congregation refuses to authorize any new creation except after approval of the title, habit, object, and work of the proposed community, and forbids that any substantial change should be made without its authority. Notwithstanding that pontifical intervention, the congregation remains <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> approves the constitutions only in so far as they are in accordance with the rules approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. As it remains <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> we may conclude that the Roman disciplinary decrees do not affect it unless this is clearly stated. Diocesan congregations have the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as their first superior. It is his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to control admissions, authorize dismissals, and dispense from <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, except that one reserved to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, the absolute and perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of chastity. He must be careful not to infringe the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> acquired by the community. Not only does he preside over elections but he confirms or annuls them, and may in case of necessity depose the superior, and make provision for filling the vacancy. These congregations are sometimes composed of houses independent of one another; this is frequently the case with Sisters <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a>, and sometimes several houses and local superiors are grouped under one superior general. Some of the congregations are confined to one diocese, while others extend to several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>: in the latter case, each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> ordinary has under him the houses in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> with power to authorize or suppress them. The congregation itself depends on the concurrence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in whose <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> any houses are situated; and this concurrence is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for its suppression. Such is the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> of the constitution "Conditae". Before it can spread into another diocese, a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> congregation must have the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to whom it is subject, and often by agreement among <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> a real superiority is reserved to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of origin. As to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> by which they are governed, a great number of congregations, especially those devoted to the care of the sick in <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, follow the rule of St. Augustine and have special constitutions; others have only constitutions peculiar to themselves; others again form communities of tertiaries. The curious institution of <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguines</a> still flourishes in a few cities of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>.
