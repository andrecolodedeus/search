<h1>Nuptial Mass</h1>  

<p>"Missa pro sponso et sponsa", the last among the votive Masses in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. It is composed of lessons and chants suitable to the Sacrament of Matrimony, contains <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> just married and is interwoven with part of the marriage rite, of which in the complete form it is an element.

<p>As the Mass was looked upon as the natural accompaniment of any solemn function (<a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of churches, etc.), it was naturally celebrated as part of the marriage service. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (d. about 220; ad Uxor., II, 9) mentions the oblation that confirms marriage (matrimonium quod ecclesia conciliat et confirmat oblatio). All the Roman Sacramentaries contain the nuptial Mass (The Leonine, ed. Feltoc, 140-142; The Gelasian, ed. Wilson, 265-267; The Gregorian, P.L., LXXVIII, 261-264), with our present <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and others (a special <em>Hanc Igitur</em> and Preface). The Gelasian Sacramentary (loc. cit.) contains, moreover, the blessing now said after the <em>Ite missa est</em>, then said after the Communion, a Gallican addition (Duchesne, "Origines du Culte", Paris, ed. 2, 1898 n. 417). <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Pope Nicholas I</a> (858-867) in his instruction for the Bulgars, in 866, describes the whole rite of marriage, including the crowning of the man and wife that is still the prominent feature of the rite in the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a>; this rite contains a Mass at which the married <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> make the offertory and receive communion (Rasp. ad cons, Bulgarorum, iii, quoted by Duchesne op. cit., 413-414).

<p>The present rules for a nuptial Mass are; first, that it may not be celebrated in the closed time for <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, that is from <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> Sunday till after the octave of the Epiphany and from <a href="../cathen/01775b.htm">Ash Wednesday</a> till after <a href="../cathen/09400a.htm">Low Sunday</a>. During these times no reference to a marriage may be made in Mass; if people wish to be married then they must be content with the little service in the Ritual, without music or other solemnities. This is what is meant by the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a>: "claudun tur nuptiarum solemnia"; it is spoken of usually as the closed season. During the rest of the year the nuptial Mass may be said at a wedding any day except <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feasts of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, doubles of the first and second class and such privileged <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferias</a> and octaves as exclude a double. It may not displace the Rogation Mass at which the procession is made, nor may it displace at least one Requiem on All Souls day. On these occasions its place is taken by the Mass of the day to which commemorations of the nuptial Mass are added in the last place and at which the <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> are inserted in their place. The nuptial blessing is considered as part of the nuptial Mass. It may never be given except during this Mass or during a Mass that replaces it (and commemorates it) when it cannot be said, as above. The nuptial Mass and blessing may be celebrated after the closed time for people married during it. So nuptial Mass and blessing always go together; either involves the other. One Mass and blessing may be held for several pairs of married people, who must all be present. The forms, however, remain in the singular as they are in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. The Mass and blessing may not be held if the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> has already received this blessing in a former marriage. This rule only affects the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, for whom the blessing is more specially intended (see the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> <em>Deus qui potestate</em>). It must be understood exactly as stated. A former marriage without this blessing, or the fact that children had been born before the marriage, is no hindrance. Nor may the nuptial Mass and blessing be held in cases of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> (<em>mixta religio</em>) in spite of any <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. According to the Constitution "Etsi sanctissimus Dominus" of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> (15 November, 1858), <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> must be celebrated outside the church (in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and America this is understood as meaning outside the sanctuary and choir), without the blessing of the ring or of the spouses without any <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rite or vestment, without proclamation of <a href="../cathen/02255a.htm">banns</a>.

<p>The rite of the nuptial Mass and blessing is this: The Mass has neither Gloria nor Creed. It counts as a votive Mass not for a grave matter; therefore it has three collects, its own, the commemoration of the day, and the third which is the one chosen for semi-doubles at that time of the year unless there be two commemorations. At the end <em>Benedicamus Domino</em> and the Gospel of St. John are said. The colour is white. The bridegroom and bride assist near the altar (just outside the sanctuary), the man on the right. After the <em>Pater noster</em> the celebrant <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">genuflects</a> and goes to epistle side. Meanwhile the bridegroom and bride come up and kneel before him. Turning to them he says the two <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> <em>Propitiare Domine</em> and <em>Deus qui potestate</em> (as in the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>) with folded hands. He then goes back to the middle and continues the Mass. They go back to their places. He gives them Communion at the usual time. This implies that they are <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and explains the misused name "wedding breakfast" afterwards. But the Communion is strict law (S.R.C., no 5582, 21 March, 1874). Immediately after the <em>Benedicamus Domino</em> and its answer the celebrant again goes to the Epistle side and the bridegroom and kneel before him as before. The celebrant turning to them says the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> <em>Deus Abraham</em> (without <em>Oremus</em>). He is then told to warn them "with grave words to be faithful to one another". The rest of the advice suggested in the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> is now generally left out. He sprinkles them with <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>; they retire, he goes back to the middle of the altar, says <em>Placeat tibi</em>, gives the blessing and finishes Mass as usual.

<p>In the cases in which the "Missa pro sponso et sponsa" may not be said but may be commemorated, the special <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and blessing are inserted in the <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> in the same way. But the colour must be that of the day. During the closed time it is, of course, quite possible for the married people to have a Mass said for their intention, at which they receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>. The nuptial Blessing in this Mass is quite different thing from the actual celebration of the marriage which must always precede it. The blessing is given to people already married, as the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> imply. It need not be given (nor the Mass said) by the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who assisted at the marriage. But both these functions (assitance and blessing) are <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, which no one else may undertake without delegation from him. Generally they are so combined that the marriage takes place immediately before the Mass; in this case the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at the marriage in Mass vestments, but without the <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and other countries where a civil declaration is required by law, this is usually made in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> between the marriage and the Mass. Canon Law in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> orders that marriages be made only in churches that have a district with the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> (Conc. prov. Westm. I, decr. XXII, 4). This implies as a general rule, but does not command absolutely, that the nuptial Mass also be celebrated in such a church.
