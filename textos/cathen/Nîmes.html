<h1>N&icirc;mes</h1>  

<p>(NEMAUSENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a>; suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, comprises the civil Department of Gard. By the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a> its territory was united with the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Diocese of Avignon</a>. It was re-established as a separate diocese in 1821 and a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 27 April, 1877, grants to its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to add Alais and Uz&egrave;s to their episcopal style, these two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> being now combined with that of N&icirc;mes.

<p>That N&icirc;mes (Nemausus) was an important city in Roman antiquity is shown by the admirable <em>Maison Carr&eacute;e</em>, the remains of a superb amphitheatre, and the <em>Pont du Gard</em>, four and a half leagues from the city. Late and rather contradictory traditions attribute the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of N&icirc;mes either to Celidonius, the man "who was blind from his birth" of the Gospel, or to St. Honestus, the apostle of Navarre, said to have been sent to southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by St. Peter, with <a href="../cathen/13486b.htm">St. Saturninus</a> (Sernin), the apostle of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> apostle of N&icirc;mes was St. Baudilus, whose <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is placed by some at the end of the third century, and, with less reason, by others at the end of the fourth. Many writers affirm that a certain St. Felix, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> about 407, was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of N&icirc;mes, but Duchesne questions this. There was a see at N&icirc;mes as early as 396, for in that year a synodical letter was sent by a Council of N&icirc;mes to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gaul. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whose date is positively known is Sedatus, present at the <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Council of Agde</a> in 506. Other noteworthy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are: St. John (about 511, before 526); St. Remessarius (633-40); Bertrand of Languissel (1280-1324), faithful to <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, and for that reason driven from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> for a year by <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>; Cardinal Guillaume d'Estouteville (1441-49); Cardinal Guillaume Briconnet (1496-1514); the famous <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator <a href="../cathen/06100a.htm">Fl&eacute;chier</a> (1687-1710); the distinguished polemist Plantier (1855-75) whose pastoral letter (1873) called forth a protest from <a href="../cathen/16010b.htm">Bismarck</a>; the preacher Besson (1875-88). <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a>, coming to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to preach the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of N&icirc;mes in 1096 and presided over a council. <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> visited N&icirc;mes in 1162. <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a> (1265-68), born at Saint Gilles, in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, granted the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of that town numerous favors. St. Louis, who embarked at Aigues-Mortes for his two <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a>, surrounded N&icirc;mes with walls. In 1305, <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> passed through the city on his way to Lyons to be <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a>. In consequence of disputes about the sale of grapes to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> household, <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> laid an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> on N&icirc;mes in 1358. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was greatly disturbed by the Religious Wars: on 29 Sept., 1567, five years before the Massacre of St. Bartholemew, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of N&icirc;mes, actuated by fanaticism, perpetrated the massacre of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> known in French history as the Michelade. Louis XIII at N&icirc;mes issued the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of religious pacification known as the Peace of N&icirc;mes.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Uz&egrave;s historically known is Constantius, present at the Council of <a href="../cathen/16078b.htm">Vaison</a> in 442. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were St. Firminus (541-53) and St. Ferreol (553-81). In the sixteenth century, Bishop Jean de Saint Gelais (1531-60) became a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a>. The celebrated missionary <a href="../cathen/02780a.htm">Bridaine</a> (1701-67) was a native of the Diocese of Uz&egrave;s. This little city was for seventy days the enforced residence of <a href="../cathen/11380b.htm">Cardinal Pacca</a>, after his confinement at Fenestrelles (1812). The town of Pont Saint Esprit, on the Rh&ocirc;ne, owes its names to a bridge built there between 1265 and 1309 with the proceeds of a general collection made by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>.

<p>About 570, Sigebert, King of Austrasia, created a see at Arisitum (Alais) taking fifteen <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> from the Diocese of N&icirc;mes. In the eighth century, when Septimania was annexed to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire, the Diocese of Alais was suppressed and its territory returned to the Diocese of N&icirc;mes. At the request of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, a see was again created at Alais by <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a>, in 1694. The future Cardinal de Bausset, <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet's</a> biographer was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Alais from 1784 to 1790. After the Edict of Nantes, Alais was one of the <em>places de suret&eacute;</em> given to the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>. Louis XIII took back the town in 1629, and the Convention of Alais, signed 29 June of that year, suppressed the political privileges of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>.

<p>The chief <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> of the present Diocese of N&icirc;mes are: Notre Dame de Gr&acirc;ce, Rochefort, dating from <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, and commemorating a victory over the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> and his mother, Anne of Austria, established here a foundation for perpetual Masses. Notre Dame de Gr&acirc;ce, Laval, in the vicinity of Alais, dating from not later than 900. Notre Dame de Bon Secours de Prime Combe, Fontan&egrave;s, since 887. Notre Dame de Bonheur, founded 1045 on the mountain of l'Aigoual in the vicinity of Valleraugues. Notre Dame de Belvezet, a shrine of the eleventh century, on Mont Andavu. Notre Dame de Vauvert, whither the converted <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> were sent, often visited by St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>. The shrine of St. V&eacute;r&eacute;d&egrave;me, a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> who died <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> St. Baudilus, at Trois Fontaines and at Valsainte near N&icirc;mes. The following Saints are especially <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the present Diocese of N&icirc;mes: St. Castor, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Apt (fourth to fifth century), a native of N&icirc;mes; the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> St. Theodoritus, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> of the town of Uz&egrave;s; the Athenian <a href="../cathen/06559a.htm">St. Giles</a> (AEgidius, sixth cent.), living as a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">recluse</a> near Uz&egrave;s when he was accidentally wounded by King Childeric, later <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> built by Childeric in reparation for this accident, <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> also in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; Blessed Peter of Luxemburg who made a sojourn in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, at Villeneuve-lez-Avignon (1369-87).

<p>Prior to the Associations Law of 1901 the diocese had <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Augustinians of the Assumption</a> (a congregation which originated in the city of N&icirc;mes), <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>, <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/09749d.htm">Missionaries of the Company of Mary</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Fathers, <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a>, <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>, and various orders of teaching brothers. The Oblates of the Assumption, for teaching and foreign missions, also founded here, and the <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a> Sisters of Charity, teachers and nurses, have their mother-houses at N&icirc;mes. At the beginning of the century the religious congregations conducted in this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>: 3 creches, 53 day nurseries, 6 boys' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 20 girls' <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>, 1 employment agency for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>, 1 house of refuge for penitent <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 6 houses of mercy, 20 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> or asylums, 11 houses of visiting nurses, 3 houses of retreat, 1 home for incurables. In 1905 the Diocese of N&icirc;mes contained 420,836 inhabitants, 45 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 239 succursal <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 52 vicariates subventioned by the State.
