<h1>O'Higgins</h1>  

<h2>Ambrose Bernard O'Higgins</h2>

<p>Born in County Meath, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in 1720; died at <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>, 18 March, 1810. An uncle, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, placed him at <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in <a href="../cathen/03131b.htm">Cadiz</a>. From there he went to South America landing at <a href="../cathen/03035a.htm">Buenos Aires</a>, and thence to <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>, where for a time he was a pedlar. Later, he became a contractor for opening new roads, and finally joined the Spanish army in the engineer corps. His talent and energy was soon recognized, and secured for him a series of rapid promotions with a patent of nobility as Count of Bellenar, and later, 26 May, 1788, as Marquis of Orsorno, with the Governor-Generalship of <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>. The following eight years he spent in developing the resources of the country, his enlightened policy accomplishing much for Spanish interest. In 1796 he was appointed Viceroy of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, the highest rank in the Spanish colonial service, reaching <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a> with that commission on June sixth of that year. His vice-royalty ended with his death.
<h2>Bernard O'Higgins</h2>

<p>His only son, born at Chillan, 20 August, 1776; died at <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a> 14 October, 1842. At the age of fifteen his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> sent him to a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. At his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> death he returned to <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a> where he joined the revolutionists as a colonel of militia against the domination of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. His <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a> brought him higher rank, and the battle of Chacabuco, 12 February, 1817, which broke the power of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>, was mainly won by his gallant impetuosity. This victory led to the capture of the capitol and he was proclaimed by its citizens Dictator of <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>. He gave ample evidence of executive ability during an administration of six years, but a fickle populace deposed him from office in February, 1823, and drove him into exile in <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>. His ashes were brought back by the <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chilian</a> Government and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> with great pomp in 1869, and in 1872 his equestrian <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> was inaugurated at <a href="../cathen/13460a.htm">Santiago</a> amid national rejoicing. His son Demetrio, a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> and <a href="../cathen/03794b.htm">patriotic</a> <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chilian</a> <em>ranchero</em>, died in 1869.
