<h1>Oaxaca</h1>  

<p>(Or ANTEQUERA).

<p>Situated in the southern part of the <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">Republic of Mexico</a>, bounded on the north by the Bishopric of Huajuapam and the Archbishopric of Puebla, on the east by the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/15344c.htm">Vera Cruz</a>, on the west by that of <a href="../cathen/14473a.htm">Tehuantepec</a>, and on the south by the Pacific Ocean. When the conquest of New Spain was accomplished, <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s</a> sought the aid of the powerful Tlaxcaltecas, who had established a republic and were at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02169b.htm">Aztec</a> Emperor Moctezuma. Out of gratitude to the Tlaxcaltecas, the first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> that was founded on the American continent was called Tlaxcala, that of Mexico was second, and later that of <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>. Oaxaca, the fourth in the order of succession, was established, under the name of Antequera, by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, 21 July, 1535, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the Right Rev. Juan L&oacute;pez de Z&aacute;rate, having been <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a> that same year. From then to the present day only thirty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have governed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the last being the Most Rev. Eulogio G. Gillow, <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a> 23 May, 1887. On 23 June, 1891, Antequera was raised to the rank of an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, and has, at the present time as suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, <a href="../cathen/03652b.htm">Chiapas</a>, <a href="../cathen/15737b.htm">Yucat&aacute;n</a>, <a href="../cathen/14423b.htm">Tabasco</a>, <a href="../cathen/14473a.htm">Tehuantepec</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03222b.htm">Campeche</a>.

<p>Prior to the Conquest the religion of the entire extensive region now comprised in the Archbishopric of Antequera, or Oaxaca, was <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> in various forms, according to the different races that populated this district, the Mixteca, Zapoteca, Mixe, anthinanteca predominating, although twenty-two entirely different dialects are known among them. The famous ruins of Mitla indicate that the most venerable <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the entire American continent resided there, one who was greatly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> not only by the different villages of the ancient Anahuac, but by others; as those of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from history that when the conquerors landed in <a href="../cathen/15344c.htm">Vera Cruz</a>, Moctezuma consulted the High-Priest Achiutla, who announced to him that the <a href="../cathen/11264c.htm">oracle</a> had predicted the end of his empire. Abjectly crushed, the Emperor yielded to the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>. The kings of Zaachila and Tehuantepec received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and submitted to the mild yoke of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. After the conquest of Moctezuma's empire the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> who penetrated to Tenochtitl&aacute;n were amazed to see the wealth that Moctezuma had accumulated, and in all probability <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that a great part of the gold came from Oaxaca. This would explain why from the first they turned their footsteps towards Oaxaca, where the first <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated on 25 Nov., 1521, feast of St. Catherine, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. Beginning then development was very rapid, as much perhaps from the fact that <a href="../cathen/04397a.htm">Cort&eacute;s</a> was created Marquis of Valle de Oaxaca, in recognition of his distinguished services, as because of the rich mineral resources of the country, whose importance was such that it ranked next to the <a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">City of Mexico</a> itself. Missionaries of the different <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders were introduced: <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Friars of the Order of Mercy, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, Brothers of St. John; <a href="../cathen/02534b.htm">Bethlehemites</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a>. All these congregations built handsome churches in the capital of Oaxaca, which are still in existence, with their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and subordinate houses annexed. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> laboured most <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> for the conversion of the natives by means of missions and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> work. Four Bishops of Oaxaca have been drawn from that order, while four other orders have each contributed one.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> at the present time comprises besides the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> chapter &#151; which is composed of the dean, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, and chanter &#151; a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> censor, a canon penitentiary, and six other canons. There is a master of ceremonies, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacristan</a> of the main <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and four choir <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> government consists of a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, a secretary of the Executive Council, and two assistants. The <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the <em>Provisorato</em> are discharged by the provisor, fiscal promoter, defender of the Holy Office, and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> attorney. There is also a Commission of Rites, composed of four <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, one of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian Doctrine</a> under the charge of six <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, and a School Board made up of three <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a> and two <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>.

<p>There are 3 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in the city each with its respective church, and 19 other churches, that of St. Dominic being notable for the beauty of its architecture and the richness of its ornamentation. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, which has a <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and four <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>, is remarkable for the exquisite style and ornateness of its decorations, the beauty of its altars, <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a>, and vestments, the present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> having devoted great thought and expenditure to improvements of this kind, which increase the dignity of the service. There exist in the archdiocese 25 <em>foranias</em> (deaneries) which comprise 132 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and 223 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p>Only within recent years have there been any <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in Oaxaca; these hold their services in private houses. It is not easy to give exactly the number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> belonging to the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, because they are chiefly natives who live in the rural districts and surrounding mountains, but the population is estimated in 1910 at 1,041,035. The State does not sanction the existence of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities of men or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Since they must carry on their various works without attracting public notice, it is difficult to give statistics either of their number, or of the institutions under their care. So, too, while the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are steadily increasing it is almost impossible to give their exact number. In the city of Oaxaca (in 1910 pop. 37,469) there is a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> divided into three sections: <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> students (<em>clericales</em>), seminarians (<em>seminaristas</em>), and preparatory students (<em>apostolicos</em>), of whom 102 are interns, under the charge of 6 <a href="../cathen/10368c.htm">Paulist Fathers</a>, 6 assistant professors, and 3 coadjutor brothers. The College of the Holy Ghost, established to train the sons of the best <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> for various careers, has 70 boarders and 250 day scholars under the direction of 8 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and several professors. There are 3 select academies for young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, with an attendance of 600; 6 free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys, with 1600 pupils, and 4 for girls, with 700. Among the <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> under <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> control are a day nursery accommodating 80 children under the care of 5 nurses, a charity <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> with 24 beds, 12 for men and 12 for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and a home for the poor with about 90 inmates.
