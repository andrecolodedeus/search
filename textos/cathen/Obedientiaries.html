<h1>Obedientiaries</h1>  

<p>A name commonly used in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> for the lesser officials of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> who were appointed by will of the superior. In some cases the word is used to include all those who held office beneath the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, but more frequently the prior and sub-prior are excluded from those signified by it. To the obedientiaries were assigned the various <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> pertaining to their different offices and they possessed considerable power in their own departments. There was always a right of appeal to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> or superior, but in practice most details were settled by the "customary" of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The list that follows gives the usual titles of the obedientiaries, but in some <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> other names were used and other official positions may be found: thus, for example, to this day, in the great <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a> the name "dean" is given to the official who is called prior in all other <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> houses. <ul><li>(1) The "cantor", or "precentor", usually assisted by the "sub-cantor", or "succentor" (see <a href="../cathen/03306a.htm">CANTOR</a>). <li>(2) The <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacrist</a>, or <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacristan</a>, who had charge of the monastic church and of all things <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the services. He had, as a rule, several assistants: <ul><li>(a) the subsacrist, also known as the secretary, the "matricularius", or the master of work; <li>(b) the treasurer; <li>(c) the "revestiarius".</ul> <li>(3) The cellarer, or bursar, who acted as chief purveyor of all foodstuffs to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and as general steward. In recent times the name <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> is often found used for this official. He had as assistants: <ul><li>(a) the subcellarer; <li>(b) the "granatorius". Chapter xxxi of <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">St. Benedict's Rule</a> tells "What kind of man the Cellarer ought to be"; in practice this position is the most responsible one after that of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> or superior.</ul> <li>(4) The refectorian, who had charge of the frater, or refectory and its furniture, including such things as crockery, cloths, dishes, spoons, forks, etc. <li>(5) The kitchener, who presided over the cookery department, not only for the community but for all guests, dependants, etc. <li>(6) The <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> master (see <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">NOVICE</a>), whose assistant was sometimes called the "zelator". <li>(7) The infirmarian, besides looking after the sick brethren, was also responsible for the quarterly "blood letting" of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, a custom almost universal in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. <li>(8) The guest-master, whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> are dealt with in chapter liii of <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">St. Benedict's Rule</a>. <li>(9) The almoner. <li>(10) The chamberlain, or "vestiarius".</ul>

<p>Besides these officials who were appointed more or less permanently, there were certain others appointed for a week at a time to carry out various <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. These positions were usually filled in turn by all below the rank of sub-prior, though very busy officials, e.g., the cellarer, might be excused. The chief of these was the hebdomadarian, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for the week. It was his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to sing the <a href="../cathen/09790a.htm">conventual mass</a> on all days during the week, to intone the "Deus in adjutorium" at the beginning of each of the <a href="../cathen/07500b.htm">canonical hours</a>, to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, etc. The antiphoner was also appointed for a week at a time. It was his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to read or sing the invitatory at <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>, to give out the first <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphon</a> at the Psalms, and also the versicles, responsoria after the lessons etc. The weekly reader and servers in the kitchen and refectory entered upon their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> when, in company with the servers of the previous week, they had to ask and receive a special blessing in choir as directed in chapters xxxv and xxxviii of <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">St. Benedict's Rule</a>. Nowadays the tendency is towards a simplification in the details of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">monastic life</a> and consequently to a reduction in the number of officials in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, but all the more important offices named above exist today in every <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> though the name obedientiaries has quite dropped out of everyday use.
