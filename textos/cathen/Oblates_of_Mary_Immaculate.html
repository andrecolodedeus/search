<h1>Oblates of Mary Immaculate</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Name and origin</h2>

<p>The first members of this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, founded in 1816, were known as "Missionaries of Provence". They received the title of "Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate" and <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> as a congregation under simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 17 February, 1826. The founder, <a href="../cathen/10094a.htm">Charles Joseph Eug&egrave;ne de Mazenod</a> (b. at <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, 1 August, 1782), left <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at an early age on account of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, and remained four years at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, one at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and three at <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, before returning to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he entered St. Sulpice in 1808. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a> on 21 December, 1811. In 1818 he had gathered a small community around him, and made his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of the Mission, <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, with MM. Mounier, Tempier, Mye, and Moreau as fellow-priests, and MM. Dupuy, Court&egrave;s, and Suzanne as scholastic students. He became <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> in 1823, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Icosia and coadjutor in 1834, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> in 1837. In 1856 he was named senator and member of the Legion of Honour by <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a>, and died in 1861, having been superior-general of his congregation from 1816 to that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Members and organization</h2>

<p>The congregation consists of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and lay-brothers, leading a common life. The latter act as temporal coadjutors, farm or workshop instructors in industrial and reformatory <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and teachers and catechists on the foreign missions. The central and supreme authority of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is two-fold:

<p>(1) intermittent and extraordinary, as vested in the general chapter meeting once in six years, and composed of the general administrators, <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a>, vicars of missions, and delegates from each province or vicariate;

<p>(2) ordinary, as vested in the superior-general elected for life by the general chapter, and assisted by a council of four assistants and a bursar-general, named for a term of years, renewable by the same authority. The general administration was situated at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> until 1861, when it was transferred to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; the persecutions of 1902 <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> its removal to <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> in 1903, whence it was transferred to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1905. The congregation is officially represented at the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> by a procurator-general named by the central administration; this authority also elects the chaplain-general of the Holy Family Sisters of Bordeaux, founded by Abb&eacute; de Noailles, and by him confided to the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> of the Oblate Fathers. Until 1851 all Oblate houses were directly dependent on the central administration. The general chapter held in that year divided its dependencies into provinces and missionary vicariates, each having its own provincial or vicar aided by a council of four consultors and a bursar. At the head of each regularly constituted house is placed a local superior aided by two assessors and a bursar, all named by the provincial administration. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> also possess a special council of professors and directors.
<h2 id="section3">Recruiting</h2>

<p>Recruiting is made by means of juniorates, novitiates, and scholasticates.
<h3 id="A">Juniorates or apostolic schools</h3>

<p>The first establishment of this description was founded in 1841 by the Oblates of Notre Dame des Lumi&egrave;res near <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and their example, soon followed by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, became widely adopted in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The congregation has at present thirteen juniorates situated: at <a href="../cathen/11352a.htm">Ottawa</a>, <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, San Antonio (Texas), St. Boniface (Manitoba) and Strathcona (Alberta) in the new world; St. Charles (Holland), Waereghem (Belgium), Sancta Maria a Vico and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> (<a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>), Urmieta (Spain), and Belcamp Hall (<a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>) in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; Colombo and Jaffna in the Island of Ceylon.
<h3 id="B">Novitiates</h3>

<p>Novitiates are fed from the juniorates, and also from colleges, <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, and gymnasia. They are at present thirteen in number and situated at Lachine (Canada), Tewksbury (Massachusetts), San Antonio (Texas), St. Charles (Manitoba), St. Gerlach, H&uuml;nfeld, and Maria Engelport (Germany), Niewenhove (Belgium), Le Bestin (Luxemburg), St. Pierre d'Aoste (<a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>), Urmieta (Spain), Stillorgan (<a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>), and Colombo (Ceylon).
<h3 id="C">Scholasticates</h3>

<p>Scholasticates receive <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> who have been admitted to temporal <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> at the end of a year's probation. The first Scholasticate of the congregation was dedicated to the Sacred Heart at Montolivet, <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, in 1857; it was transferred to Autun in 1861, to Dublin in 1880, to St. Francis (Holland) in 1889, and to <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> in 1891. The ten establishments at present occupied are situated at <a href="../cathen/11352a.htm">Ottawa</a>, Tewksbury, <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, H&uuml;nfeld, Stillorgan, <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, and Colombo (2).
<h2 id="section4">Ends and means</h2>

<p>The congregation was formed to repair the havoc caused by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, and its very existence so soon afterwards was a sign of religious revival. Its multiple ends may thus be divided:
<h3 id="A">Primary</h3>

<p>(1) To revive the spirit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> among rural and industrial populations by means of missions and retreats, in which devotion to the Sacred Heart and to Mary Immaculate is recommended as a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> means of regeneration. "He hath sent me to preach the Gospel to the poor", has been adopted as the device of the congregation. (2) Care of young men's <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> clubs, etc. (3) Formation of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>.


<h3 id="B">Secondary or derived</h3>

<p>To adapt itself to the different circumstances arising from its rapid development in new countries, the congregation has necessarily extended its sphere of action to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> organization, to the direction of industrial or reformatory <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, of establishments of secondary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in its principal centres, and of higher institutions of learning, such as the <a href="../cathen/11352b.htm">University of Ottawa</a>.
<h2 id="section5">Prominent members, past and present</h2>
<h3 id="A">Superior generals</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/10094a.htm">Mgr. de Mazenod</a> (1816); <a href="../cathen/05743b.htm">Very Rev. J. Fabre</a> (1861); L. Soullier (1893); C. Augier (1898) A. Lavillardi&egrave;re (1906); Mgr A. Dontenwill (1908).

<h2 id="section6">Principal undertakings</h2>
<h3 id="A">General</h3>

<p>(1) In canonically constituted countries a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church or public <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> is attached to each establishment of Oblates. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> are all provided with <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, while many have colleges or academies and a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. Several of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> residences (e.g., <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, Quebec, etc.) serve as centres for missionaries who assist the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> by giving retreats or missions and taking temporary charge of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. (2) In new or missionary countries, the posts are considered as fixed residences from which the missionaries radiate to surrounding fields of action (e.g., Edmonton Alberta). Each of these centres possesses fully equipped <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> whilst many have <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. Instruction is given in English, French, or native tongues by <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities or by the fathers and brothers themselves. Indigenous mission work is carried on by the periodical recurrence of missions or retreats, and the regular instructions of catechists. The printing press is much used, and the congregation has published complete dictionaries and other works in the native idioms among which it labours.
<h3 id="B">Special</h3>

<p>(1) <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. &#151; Until recent years the evangelization of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> West and of <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a> was the almost exclusive work of the Oblate Fathers, as that of the extreme north still is. Cathedrals, <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, and colleges were built by them, and often handed over to <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> or to other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities (as in the case of the St. Boniface College, which is at present flourishing under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>). The <a href="../cathen/13339b.htm">Archiepiscopal See of St. Boniface</a> since 1853, and the episcopal Sees of <a href="../cathen/01261b.htm">St. Albert</a>, <a href="../cathen/12427b.htm">Prince Albert</a>, with the Vicariates of Athabaska and Mackenzie since their foundation, have been, and are still occupied by Oblates. That of New Westminster ceased to be so in 1908. The Diocese of Ottawa had an Oblate as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and owes the foundation of most of its <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and institutions to members of the congregation, who have also founded a number of the centres in the new Vicariates of Temiskaming and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, as well as in the <a href="../cathen/03658a.htm">Diocese of Chicoutimi</a>. Among the recent labours of the Oblates in the West a special mention must be given to the religious organization of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, Poles, and <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/16049a.htm">Vicariate of Keewatin</a> (1910) is entrusted to an Oblate <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whose missionaries are devoted to the regeneration of nomadic <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indian tribes</a>. (2) South Africa. &#151; The Oblates have founded and occupy the four <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a> of Natal, Orange River, Basutoland and Transvaal, as also the Prefecture Apostolic of Cimbebasia. Its members served as military <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> on both sides during the Boer <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. (3) <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. &#151; The immense Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/04124a.htm">Colombo</a> and Jaffna, with their flourishing colleges and missions, are the achievement of the enterprising <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Oblate Fathers under Mgr Bonjean, O.M.I. (4) Western Australia. A missionary vicariate was founded from the British Province in 1894, and is actively engaged in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> and reformatory work.
<h2 id="section7">Establishments of education and formation</h2>
<h3 id="A">For the congregation</h3>

<p>(1) Scholasticates affording a course of two years in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and social <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> (three years in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>), and of four years in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a> according to the spirit and method of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. The Roman scholastics follow the programme of the Gregorian University and graduate in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, canon law, and Scripture. The scholastics at Ottawa graduate in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, of which they form an integral part. (2) Novitiates giving religious formation with adapted studies. (3) Juniorates providing a complete classical course preparatory to the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a>. The Ottawa juniorists make their course at the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and graduate in the <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">Faculty of Arts</a>.
<h3 id="B">Higher education</h3>

<p>(1) Concerning the Ottawa University see the special article. (2) Grand Seminaries. &#151; Until the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of 1902 the congregation was in charge of these establishments at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, <a href="../cathen/06269a.htm">Fr&eacute;jus</a>, <a href="../cathen/01238b.htm">Ajaccio</a>, and Romans. It is at present entrusted with those of <a href="../cathen/01238b.htm">Ajaccio</a>, Ottawa (in connexion with the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>), <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a>, <a href="../cathen/04124a.htm">Colombo</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08269a.htm">Jaffna</a>. The two last-named are occupied in the formation of a native <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and have already provided over forty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.
