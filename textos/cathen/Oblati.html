<h1>Oblati</h1>  

<p>Oblati (Oblat&aelig;, Oblates) is a word used to describe any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, not professed <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> or <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, who have been offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or have dedicated themselves to His service, in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> religion. It has had various particular uses at different periods in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a>. The children vowed and given by their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to the monastic life, in houses under the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>, were commonly known by the name during the century and a half when the custom was in vogue, and the councils of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> treated them as <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> &#151; that is, until the Council of Toledo (656) forbade their acceptance before the age of ten and granted them free permission to leave the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, if they wished, when they reached the age of puberty. At a later date the word "oblate" was used to describe such lay men or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as were pensioned off by royal and other patrons upon <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> or <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, where they lived as in an almshouse or <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. In the eleventh century, it is on record that Abbot <a href="../cathen/15629b.htm">William of Hirschau</a> or Hirsau, in the old Diocese of Spires, introduced lay brethren into the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. They were or two kinds: the <em>fratres barbati</em> or <em>conversi</em>, who took <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> but were not claustral or enclosed <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and the <em>oblati</em>, workmen or servants who <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> subjected themselves, whilst in the service of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, to religious obedience and observance. Afterwards, the different status of the <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> in the several orders of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and the ever-varying regulations concerning him introduced by the many reforms, destroyed the distinction between the <em>conversus</em> and the <em>oblatus</em>. The Cassinese <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, for instance at first carefully differentiated between <em>conversi, commissi,</em> and <em>oblati</em>; the nature of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and the forms of the habits were in each case specifically distinct. The <em>conversus</em>, the <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> properly so called, made solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> like the choir <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and wore the <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a>; the <em>commissus</em> made simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and was dressed like a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, but without the <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a>; the <em>oblatus</em> made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of obedience to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, gave himself and his goods to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and wore a sober secular dress. But, in 1625, we find the <em>conversus</em> reduced below the status of the <em>commissus</em>, inasmuch as he was permitted only to make simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and that for a year at a time; he was in fact undistinguishable, except by his dress, from the <em>oblatus</em> of a former century. Then, in the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, <em>oblatus, confrater,</em> and <em>donatus</em> became interchangeable titles, given to any one who, for his generosity or special service to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, received the privilege of lay membership, with a share in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> of the brethren.

<p>Canonically, only two distinctions were ever of any consequence: first, that between those who entered religion "per modum professionis" and "per modum simplicis conversionis" the former being <em>monachi</em> and the later <em>oblati</em>; secondly, that between the oblate who was "mortuus mundo" (that is, who had given himself and his goods to religion without reservation), and the oblate who retained some control over his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and his possessions &#151; the former only (<em>plene oblatus</em>) was accounted a <em>persona ecclesiastica</em>, with enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/12437a.htm">ecclesiastical privileges</a> and immunity (<a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, "De Synodo Dioce.", VI).
<h2>Congregation of oblates: women</h2>

<p>(1) The first <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> or congregation of oblates was that founded in the fifteenth century by <a href="../cathen/06205c.htm">St. Frances of Rome</a>, to which the name of Collatines has been given &#151; apparently by mistake. St. Frances, wife of Lorenzo Ponzani, gathered around her (in 1425, according to <a href="../cathen/02206c.htm">Baillet</a>) a number of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and girls, who formed themselves into a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> or confraternity. In 1433, as their annals witness, she settled them in a house called Tor de' Specchi, at the foot of the Capitol, giving them the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> and some constitutions drawn up under her own direction, and putting them under guidance of the <a href="../cathen/11244c.htm">Olivetan</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of S. Maria Nuova. In the same year she asked confirmation of her <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> from <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a>, who commissioned Gaspare, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04403a.htm">Cosenza</a>, to report to him on the matter, and some days later granted the request, with permission to make a beginning of observance in the house near S. Maria Nuova, while she was seeking a more commodious habitation near S. Andrea in Vinci. The have never quitted their first establishment, but have greatly enlarged and beautified it. The object of the foundation was not unlike that of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Canonesses in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> &#151; to furnish a place of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> seclusion for ladies of noble birth, where they would not be required to mix socially with any but those of their own class, might retain and inherit <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, leave when it suited them, marry if they should wish, and, at the same time, would have the shelter of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> enclosure, the protection of the habit of a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, and the spiritual advantages of a life of religious observance. They made an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> instead of binding themselves by the usual profession and <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. Hence the name of <em>oblates</em>. The observance has always been sufficiently strict and edifying, though it is permitted to each sister to have a maid waiting on her in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and a lackey to do her commissions outside. They have a year's probation, and make their <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, in which they promise obedience to the mother president, upon the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Francis of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There are two grades amongst them: "Most Excellent", who must be princesses by birth, and the "Most Illustrious", those of inferior nobility. Their first president was Agnes de Lellis, who resigned in favour of St. Frances when the latter became a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. After her death, the <a href="../cathen/11244c.htm">Olivetan</a> general, Blessed Geronimo di Mirabello, broke off the connection between the oblates and the <a href="../cathen/11244c.htm">Olivetans</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and treasures of the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> have escaped appropriation by the Italian government, because the inmates are not, in the strict sense, <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>.

<p>(2) Differing little from the Oblates of St. Frances in their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> status, but unlike in every other respect are the <em>Donne Convertite della Maddalena</em>, under the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>, a congregation of fallen <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. They had more than one house in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Without any previous <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">noviceship</a>, they promise obedience and make oblation of themselves to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Mary Magdalene and St. Lucy. At <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a> there are similar houses of oblate penitents under the Rule of Mount Carmel.

<p>(3) <em>The Congregation of <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a></em> (so called after <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a>, their protector), founded by Rutilio Brandi, had the care of 100 poor girls, whom they had brought up until they either married or embraced religion. These oblates began religious observance at S. Lucia della Chiavica, were transferred to Monte Citorio, and, when the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> there was pulled down by <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> in 1693, returned to S. Lucia. They adopted the Augustinian Rule.

<p>(4) <em>The Daughters of the Seven Dolours of the Blessed Virgin</em>, a development out of some confraternities of the same name, founded by St. Philip Benizzi, established a house at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1652. Their object was to take in infirm <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who would not be received in other congregations. They followed the Augustinian Rule and promised stability, <em>conversio morum</em>, and obedience according to the constitutions.
<h2>Congregation of oblates: men</h2>

<p>(1) Earliest in origin of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> or congregations of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> known as oblates is that of St. Charles Borromeo. It is an institute of regular clerks, founded by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> in 1578 for the better administration of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and to enable the more spiritual-minded of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to lead a more detached and unworldly life. They live, whenever and wherever it is possible, in common. The make a simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of obedience to their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and, by doing so, bind themselves to exceptional service and declare their willingness to undertake labours for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, which are not usually classed among the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. From their constitution it is evident that their usefulness and development, and even existence, depend on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the interest he takes in them. At present, they are nowhere a large or important body, and perhaps do not meet with the encouragement they deserve.

<p>(2) The greatest and best-known congregation of oblate <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, that of Mary Immaculate (O.M.I.), is dealt with in a special article. Connected with the institute and under its direction are the Oblate Sisters of the Holy Family.

<p>(3) The Oblates of Mary, not to be confounded with those of Mary Immaculate or with the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a>, are a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> founded in 1845. They have houses at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a>, and Pinerolo, and send missionaries to <a href="../cathen/03082a.htm">Burma</a>, Ava, and Pegu in the East Indies.

<p>(4) By a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 17 June, 1898, the <em>Oblati seculares</em> O.S.B. &#151; that is, those who have received the privilege of the <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a>, and, for their friendliness and good offices, have been admitted as <em>confratres</em> of any <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> or congregation &#151; are now granted all the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>, and privileges conceded to those of any other congregations, more particularly the Cassinese. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> further states that, since <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Oblates cannot, at the same time, be tertiaries of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> or any other order, it is "congruous" that they should have peculiar privileges. He, therefore, grants them the plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> on the day of clothing and the chief feasts of oblates, etc.; twice a year the blessing in the encyclical letters of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Pope Benedict XIV</a>; the general <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> which tertiaries are able to receive on certain days during confession, with the plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> annexed to it (<em>adhibita formula pro Tertiariis pr&aelig;scripta</em>); the special plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> at the hour of death (observetur ritus et formula a constitutione P.P. Bened. XIV "Pia Mater"); an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of seven years and seven quarantines every time they hear Mass <em>corde saltem contriti</em> &#151; in a word, all and each of the privileges and favours granted to the lay tertiaries of St. Francis and other orders.
