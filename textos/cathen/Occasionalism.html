<h1>Occasionalism</h1>  

<p>Occasionalism (Latin <em>occasio</em>) is the metaphysical theory which maintains that finite things have no efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of their own, but that whatever happens in the world is caused by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, creatures being merely the <em>occasions</em> of the Divine activity. The occasion is that which by its presence brings about the action of the efficient cause. This it can do as final cause by alluring the efficiency, cause to act, or as secondary efficient cause by impelling the primary cause to do what would otherwise be left undone. Occasionalism was foreshadowed in Greek philosophy in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> who regarded <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as pervading nature and determining the actions of all beings through the fundamental <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> of self-preservation. It appeared openly in the Arabian thought of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> (cf. Stein, II, 193-245 <em>infra</em>); but its full development is found only in modern philosophy, as an outgrowth of the <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesian</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the relation between body and mind. According to <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a> the essence of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is thought, and the essence of the body extension. Body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> therefore have nothing in common. How then do they interact? <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a> himself tried to solve this problem by attributing to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the power of directing the movements of the body. But this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> conflicted with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> involved in his denial of any immediate interaction between body and mind. The first step toward a solution was taken by Johannes Clauberg (1625-65). According to him all the phenomena of the outside world are modes of motion and are caused by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. When therefore the mind seems to have acted upon the outside world, it is a pure delusion. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, however, can cause its own <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> processes, which have nothing in common with matter and its modes of action. Matter, on the other hand, cannot act upon mind. The presence of certain changes in the bodily organism is the occasion whereupon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> produces the corresponding <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> at this particular time rather than any other. To the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> Clauberg also attributes the power of influencing by means of the will the movements of the body. The Occasionalism of Clauberg is different from that of later members of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; with him the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the cause which is occasioned to act-with the others it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Louis de la Forge (Tractatus de mente humana, 1666) is regarded by some as the real father of Occasionalism. His starting point was the problem of the relation between energy and matter. Following the <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesian</a> method, he argued that what cannot be clearly and distinctly conceived cannot be held as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. We can form no clear <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the attraction exerted by one body on another at a distance nor of the energy that moves a body from one place to another. Such an energy must be something totally different from matter, which is absolutely inert; the union between matter and energy is inconceivable. Matter then, cannot be the cause of the physical phenomena; these must be produced by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the first, universal, and total cause of all motion. In his theory of the union be tween body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, de la Forge approached the later Leibnizian <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of a pre-established harmony. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must have willed and brought about the union between body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, therefore He willed to do all that is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to perfect this union. The union between body and mind involves the appearance of thoughts in consciousness at the presence of bodily activities and the sequence of bodily movements to carry out the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the mind. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> willing the union between body and mind willed also to produce as first and universal cause, the thoughts that should correspond to the organic movements of sensation, and the movements which follow upon the presence of some conscious processes. But there are other movements for which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself is responsible as efficient cause, and these are the effects of the spontaneous activity of our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>.

<p>The Occasionalism of Arnold Geulincx (1624-1669) is <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> rather than <a href="../cathen/04413a.htm">cosmological</a> in its inception. The first tract of his "Ethics" (Land's ed. of the <em>Opera</em>, <a href="../cathen/07108a.htm">The Hague</a>, 1891-93) is a study of what he termed the cardinal virtues. These are not <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> temperance, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Virtue according to Geulincx is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of Reason (III, 16-17; 29). The cardinal virtues are the properties of virtue which immediately flow from its very essence and have nothing to do with anything external. These properties are diligence, obedience, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> (III, 17). The division which Geulincx makes of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> is one of fundamental importance in his philosophy. It divides his view of the world into two parts-one, the understanding of our relation to the world and the other, the concept of our relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Humility consists in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of self and the forsaking of self. I find in myself nothing that is my own but <em>to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and to will</em>. I therefore must be conscious of all that I do, and that of which I am not conscious is not the product of my own <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>. Hence the universal principle of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>--<em>quod nescis quo modo fiat, non facis</em>--if you do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how a thing is done then you do not do it. Since then, the movements of my body take place without my knowing how the nervous impulse passes to the muscles and there-causes them to contract I do not cause my own bodily actions. "I am therefore a mere spectator of this machine. In it I form naught and renew naught, I neither make anything here nor destroy it. Everything is the work of someone else" (III, 33) . This one is the Deity who sees and knows all things. The second part of Geulincx's philosophy is connected with Occasionalism as the effect with the cause. Its guiding principle is: Where you can do nothing there also you should desire nothing (III, 222). This leads to a <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> and asceticism which however must not be taken too seriously for it is tempered by the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of caring for the body and propagating the species.

<p><a href="../cathen/09568a.htm">Nicolas Malebranche</a> developed Occasionalism to its uttermost limit, approaching so near to <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a> that he himself remarked that the difference between himself and <a href="../cathen/14217a.htm">Spinoza</a> was that he taught that the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> was in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and that <a href="../cathen/14217a.htm">Spinoza</a> said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. Starting out with the <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesian</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, that the essence of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is thought and that of matter is extension, he sought to prove that creatures have no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of their own. Experience seems to tell us that one body acts upon another, but all that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is that the movement of one body follows upon that of another. We have no experience of one body causing the movement of another. Therefore, says <a href="../cathen/09568a.htm">Malebranche</a>, one body cannot act upon another. By a similar argument he attempts to prove that body cannot act upon mind. Since experience can tell us only that a sensation follows upon the stimulus, therefore the stimulus is not the cause of the sensation. He uses the argument of Geulincx to prove that mind cannot act upon body. Not only is there no interaction between body and mind, and between one body and another, but there is no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> within the mind itself. Our sensations, for example, are not caused by bodies, and are independent of ourselves. Therefore they must be produced by some higher being. Our <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> cannot be created by the mind. Neither can they be copied from a present object, for one would have first to perceive the object in order to copy it, after which the production of an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> would be superfluous. Our <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> cannot be all possessed as complete products from the beginning, because it is a fact that the mind goes through a process of gradual development. Nor can the mind possess a faculty that produces by a sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> its own <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> because it would have to produce also the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of extended bodies and extension is excluded from the essence of the mind and therefore from the scope of its causal efficiency. If then there is no way of accounting for <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and sensations either by the efficiency of the mind itself or by that of the outside world they must be produced by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. omnipresent, universal Cause. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> knows all things because He produced all things. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of all things are in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and on account of His most intimate union with our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> the spirit can see what is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Among the Occasionalists is also mentioned R.H. Lotze (1817-81). His Occasionalism is really only a statement that we are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of any interaction between body and mind, or between one material thing and another. He is not an Occasionalist in the metaphysical sense of the word. In estimating the value of the Occasionalistic position we must realize that it sprang from a twofold problem, the interaction of body and mind and the relation of body, mind, and world to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the first cause of all. The success of the Occasionailist answer to the first difficulty was dependent upon the fate of the <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesian</a> philosophy. If man is composed of two absolutely distinct substances that have nothing in common, then the conclusion of the Occasionalists is <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and there is no interaction between body and mind. What appears to be such must be due to the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of some external being. This difficulty was not felt so keenly in <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a> because of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> and form, which explains the relation of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as that of two incomplete but complementary substances. Very soon, too, it began to lose its hold upon modern thought. For <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesianism</a> led, on the one hand, to a <a href="../cathen/10483a.htm">Monistic</a> <a href="../cathen/14229a.htm">Spiritualism</a> and, on the other, to <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">Materialism</a>. In either case the very foundations of Occasionalism were undermined. In its attempt to solve the second difficulty, Occasionalism did not meet with any particular success. From its <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the relation between body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> it argued to what must be the relation between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the creature in general. The superstructure could not stand without the foundation.
