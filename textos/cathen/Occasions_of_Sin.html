<h1>Occasions of Sin</h1>  

<p><em>Occasions of sin</em> are external circumstances--whether of things or <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>--which either because of their special nature or because of the frailty common to humanity or peculiar to some individual, incite or entice one to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>It is important to remember that there is a wide difference between the cause and the occasion of sin. The cause of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the last analysis is the perverse human will and is intrinsic to the human composite. The occasion is something extrinsic and, given the freedom of the will, cannot, properly speaking, stand in causal relation to the act or vicious habit which we call <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. There can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that in general the same <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> which binds us to refrain from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> requires us to shun its occasion. <em>Qui tenetur ad finem, tenetur ad media</em> (he who is bound to reach a certain end is bound to employ the means to attain it).

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> distinguish between the proximate and the remote occasion. They are not altogether at one as to the precise value to be attributed to the terms. <a href="../cathen/09418b.htm">De Lugo</a> defines proximate occasion (De poenit. disp. 14, n. 149) as one in which men of like calibre for the most part fall into mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or one in which experience points to the same result from the special weakness of a particular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. The remote occasion lacks these elements. All <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> are agreed that there is no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to avoid the remote occasions of sin both because this would, practically speaking, be impossible and because they do not involve serious danger of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>As to the proximate occasion, it may be of the sort that is described as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, that is, such as a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> cannot abandon or get rid of. Whether this impossibility be physical or moral does not matter for the determination of the principles hereinafter to be laid down. Or it may be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, that is within the competency of one to remove. <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">Moralists</a> distinguish between a proximate occasion which is continuous and one which, whilst it is unquestionably proximate, yet confronts a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> only at intervals. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that one who is in the presence of a proximate occasion at once <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and continuous is bound to remove it. A refusal on the part of a penitent to do so would make it imperative for the confessor to deny <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. It is not always <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the confessor to await the actual performance of this <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> before giving <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>; he may be content with a sincere promise, which is the minimum to be required. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> agree that one is not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to shun the proximate but <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> occasions. <em>Nemo tenetur ad impossibile</em> (no one is bound to do what is impossible). There is no question here of freely casting oneself into the danger of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The assumption is that stress of unavoidable circumstances has imposed this unhappy situation. All that can then be required is the employment of such means as will make the peril of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> remote. The difficulty is to determine when a proximate occasion is to be regarded as not physically (that is plain enough) but morally <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Much has been written by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> in the attempt to find a rule for the measurement of this moral necessity and a formula for its expression, but not successfully. It seems to be quite clear that a proximate occasion may be deemed <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> when it cannot be given up without grave <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> or loss of good name or without notable temporal or spiritual damage.
