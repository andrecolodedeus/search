<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Occult Art, Occultism</h1>  

<p>Under this general term are included various practices to which special articles of the Encyclopedia are devoted: <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">ANIMISM</a>; <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">ASTROLOGY</a>; <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">DIVINATION</a>; <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">FETISHISM</a>. The present article deals with the form of Occultism known as "Magic".

<p>The English word <em>magic</em> is derived through the Latin, Greek, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a>, Assyrian from the Sumerian or Turanian word <em>imga</em> or <em>emga</em> ("deep", "profound"), a designation for the Proto-Chaldean <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or wizards. <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm"><em>Magi</em></a> became a standard term for the later <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrian</a>, or Persian, <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> through whom Eastern occult arts were made known to the Greeks; hence, <em>magos</em> (as also the kindred words <em>magikos</em>, <em>mageia</em>, a magician or a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> endowed with secret <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and power like a <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persian</a> <em>magus</em>.

<p>In a restricted sense magic is understood to be an interference with the usual course of physical nature by apparently inadequate means (recitation of formularies, gestures, mixing of incongruous elements, and other mysterious actions), the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which is obtained through secret communication with the force underlying the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> (<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Devil, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the world, etc.); it is the attempt to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> not by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, gratuitously communicated to man, but by the use of hidden forces beyond man's control. Its advocates, despairing to move the Deity by supplication, seek the desired result by evoking powers ordinarily reserved to the Deity. It is a corruption of religion, not a preliminary stage of it as <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> maintain, and it appears as an accompaniment of decadent rather than of rising civilization. There is nothing to show that in Babylon, <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the use of magic decreased as these nations progressed; on the contrary, it increased as they declined. It is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that "religion is the despair of magic"; in reality, magic is but a disease of religion.

<p>The disease has been widespread; but if one land may be designated as the home of magic it is Chaldea, or Southern <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>. The earliest written records of magic are found in the cuneiform incantation inscriptions which Assyrian scribes in 800 B.C. copied from <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> originals. Although the earliest religious tablets refer to divination and in the latest Chaldean period, <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a> proper absorbed the energy of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, medicinal magic and nature magic were largely practiced. The Barupriest as the diviner seems to have held the foremost rank, but hardly inferior was the Ashipu-priest, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of incantations, who recited the magical formularies of the "Shurpu", "Maklu", and "Utukku". "Shurpu" (burning) was a spell to remove a curse due to legal uncleanness; "Maklu" (consuming) was a counter-spell against <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">wizards and witches</a>; "Utukki limmuti" (evil spirits) was a series of sixteen formulae against ghosts and demons. The "Asaski marsuti" was a series of twelve formulae against fevers and sickness. In this case the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> influence was first transferred to a wax figure representing the patient or an animal carcass, and the formulae were recited over the substitute. Ti'i tablets, nine in number, give recipes against headache. The "Labartu" incantations repeated over little figures were supposed to drive away the ogres and <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witches</a> from children. All these formulae pronounced over the figures were accompanied by an elaborate ritual, e.g., 

<blockquote><p>A table thou shalt place behind the <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censer</a> which is before the Sun-God (Statue of Shamash), thou shalt place thereon 4 jugs of sesame wine, thou shalt set thereon 3 x 12 loaves of wheat, thou shalt add a mixture of honey and butter and sprinkle with salt: a table thou shalt place behind the <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censer</a> which is before the Storm-God (Statue of Adad) and behind the <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censer</a> which is before Merodach. </p></blockquote>

<p>The magicians mentioned above were authorized and practiced "white", or benevolent, magic; the "Kashshapi", or unauthorized practitioners, employed "black" magic against <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. That the latter had preternatural powers to do harm no one <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>; hence the severe punishment meted out to them. The Code of <a href="../cathen/07125a.htm">Hammurabi</a> (c. 2000 B.C.) appointed the ordeal by water for one who was accused of being a sorcerer and for his accuser. If the accused was drowned, his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> went to the accuser; if he was saved, the accuser was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> and his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> went to the accused. This of course took place only if the accusation could not be satisfactorily proven otherwise. The principal god invoked in Chaldean Magic were Ea, source of all wisdom, and Marduk (Merodach) his son, who had inherited his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. A curiously naive scene was supposed to be enacted before the application of a medicinal spell: Marduk went to Ea's house and said: "Father, headache from the underworld hath gone forth. The patient does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the reason; whereby may he be relieved?" Ea answered: "O Marduk, my son, what can I add to thy <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? What I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> thou knowest also. Go, my son Marduk"; and then follows the prescription. This tale was regularly repeated before use of the recipe.

<p>Without suggesting the dependence of one national system of magic upon another, the similarity of some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and practices in the magic of all peoples must be noted. All rely on the power of words, the utterance of a hidden name, or the mere existence of the name on an amulet or stone. Magic was supposed to be the triumph of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> over matter, the word being the key to the mysteries of the physical world: utter the name of a malignant influence and its power is undone; utter the name of a benevolent deity and force goes out to destroy the adversary. The repeated naming of Gibel-Nusku and his attributes destroyed the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> influence in the wax figure representing the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> concerned. The force of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <em>Iota-Alpha-Omega</em> was <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> magic a mere agglomeration of vowels or of meaningless syllables was supposed to work <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Their barbarous sounds were the object of ridicule to the man of common sense. In many cases they were of Jewish, or <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a>, or Aramaic origin and because unintelligible to Egyptians, the words were generally corrupted beyond recognition. Thus on a demotic papyrus is found the prescription: "in time of storm and danger of shipwreck cry Anuk <a href="../cathen/01146a.htm">Adonai</a> and the disaster will be averted"; on a Greek papyrus the name of the Assyrian Ereskihal is found as <em>Eresgichal</em>. So potent is a name that if an inscribed amulet be washed and the water drunk or the charm written on papyrus be soaked in water and this taken, or if the word be written on hard-boiled eggs without shell and these eaten, preternatural powers come into play. Another prevalent <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> in magic is that of substitution: the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or thing to be affected by the spell is replaced by his image, or, like the "ushabtiu" figures in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>, images replace the protective powers invoked, or lastly some part (hair, nailparings, garments, etc.) take the place of the whole <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. The almost universal "magic circle" is only a mimic wall against the wicked spirits outside and goes back to Chaldean magic under the name of <em>usurtu</em>, made with a sprinkling of lime and flour. If the medical wizard or the Indian sorcerer surrounds himself or others with a rampart of little stones, this is again but the make-believe of a wall.



<p>After <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> was foremost in magic; the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> practice of <a href="../cathen/01272b.htm">alchemy</a> shows by its name its <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> origin. <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcisms</a> against all sorts of diseases abound amongst the papyri pertaining to magic, and magic claims a great part of ancient <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> literature. Unlike <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonian</a> magic however, it seems to have retained to the last its medicinal and preventive character; it rarely indulged in <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a> or prediction. <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> legend spoke of a magician Teta who worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> before Khufu (Cheops) (c. 3800 B.C.), and Greek tradition tells of Nectanebus, last native King of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (358 B.C.), as the greatest of magicians.

<p>That the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were prone to magic is evidenced by the strict <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against it and the warnings of the Prophets (<a href="../bible/exo022.htm#vrs18">Exodus 22:18</a>; <a href="../bible/deu018.htm#vrs10">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>; <a href="../bible/isa003.htm#vrs18">Isaiah 3:18, 20</a>; <a href="../bible/isa057.htm#vrs3">57:3</a>; <a href="../bible/mic005.htm#vrs11">Micah 5:11</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/2ki021.htm#vrs6">2 Kings 21:6</a>). Nevertheless, Jewish magic flourished, especially just before the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as appears from the Book of Enoch, the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs, and the Testament of Solomon. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> testifies that in his day to adjure demons was looked upon as specifically <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">"Jewish"</a>, that these adjurations had to be made in Hebrew and from Solomon's books (In Math., xxvi, 63, P.G., XIII, 1757). The frequency of Jewish magic is also corroborated by Talmudic lore.

<p>The Aryan races of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> seem somewhat less addicted to magic than the <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> or Turanian races. The Medes and the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, in the earlier and purer period of their <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Avesta</a> religion, or <a href="../cathen/02151b.htm">Zoroastrianism</a>, seem to have a horror of magic. When the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a> after their conquest of the Chaldean Empire, finally absorbed Chaldean characteristics, the <em>magi</em> had become more or less scientific astronomers rather than sorcerers. The Indians, likewise, to judge from the Rigveda, were originally free from this <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. In the Yajurveda, however, their <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> functions are practically magic performances; and the Atharvaveda contains little else than magical recitations against every ill and for every happening. The Sutras, finally, especially those of the Grihya and Sautra ritual, show how the higher aspects of religion had been overgrown by magical ceremonies. Against this degeneration the Vedanta makes a vigorous stand and attempts to bring the Indian mind back to earlier simplicity and purity. <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>, which at first disregarded magic, fell a prey to the universal contagion, especially in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and Tibet.

<p>The Aryans of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, Greeks, Romans, Teutons, and Celts were never so deeply infected as the Asiatics. The Romans were too self-reliant and W practical to be terrified by magic. Their practice of divination and auguries seems to have been borrowed from the Etruscans and the Marsi; the latter were considered experts in magic even during the empire (Verg., "&AElig;n.", VII, 750, sqq.; Pliny, VII, ii; XXI, xii). The Dii Aurunci, to avert calamities, used magical power, but they were not native Roman <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a>. The Romans were conscious of their common sense in these matters and felt themselves superior to the Greeks. In the first century of our era Oriental magic invaded the Roman Empire. Pliny in his "Natural History" (A.D. 77) in the opening chapters of Bk. XXX, gives the most important extant discussion on magic by any ancient writer, only to brand all magic as imposture. None the less his book is a storehouse of magic recipes, e.g.: "Wear as an amulet the carcass of a frog minus the claws and wrapped in a piece of russet-coloured cloth and it will cure fever" (Bk. XXXII, xxxviii). Such advice argues at least a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in medicinal magic. But among the Romans it may be said that magic was condemned in every age by many of the best spirits of their day: Tacitus, Favorinus, Sextus Empiricus, and Cicero who even demurred against divination. Officially by many <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the empire against "malefic" and "mathematici" magic was forbidden under <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>, <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, Claudius, and even <a href="../cathen/03328c.htm">Caracalla</a>; unofficially, however, even the emperors sometimes dabbled in magic. <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> is said to have studied it; but failing to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, he abandoned it in disgust. Soon after the magicians found an imperial supporter in Otho, and tolerance under <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>, Hadrian, and M. Aurelius, and even financial aid under <a href="../cathen/13743a.htm">Alexander Severus</a>.

<p>The Greeks regarded Thessaly and Thrace as the countries especially addicted to magic. The goddess <em>Hecate</em>, who was thought to preside over magical functions, was originally a foreign deity and was probably introduced into Greek mythology by Hesiod. She is not mentioned in the Iliad or Odyssey though magic was rife in Homeric times. The great mythical sorceress of the Odyssey is Circe, famous for the well-known trick of changing men into beasts (Od., X-XII). In later times the foremost magician was Medea, priestess of Hecate; but the gruesome tales told of her express the Greek horror for, as well as <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in, black magic. Curse formulae or magic spells against the lives of one's enemies seem to have found no mightier name than Hermes Chthonios. As earth-god he was a manifestation of the world-soul and controlled nature's powers. In <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> he was identified with Thoth, the god of hidden wisdom, became the keeper of magic secrets and gave his name to Trismegistic literature. Greece, moreover, welcomed and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> foreign magicians. Apuleius, by <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> an Athenian, in his "Golden Ass" (c. A.D. 150), satirized the <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">frauds</a> of contemporary wonder-workers but praised the genuine <em>magi</em> from <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. When accused of magic, he defended himself in his "Apology" which shows clearly the public attitude towards magic in his day. He quoted <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> who gave credence to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> magic <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus of Rome</a> (A Refutation of All Heresies, Bk. IV) gives a sketch of the wizardry practiced in the Greek-speaking world.

<p>Teutons and Celts also had their magic though less is known of it. The magical element in the First Edda and in the Beowulf is simple and closely connected with nature phenomena. Woden (Wodan) who invented the runes, was the god for healing and good charms. Loki was a malignant spirit who harassed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> and with the <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witch</a> Thoeck caused the death of Baldur (Balder). The magic of the mistletoe seems to be an heirloom from earliest Teutonic times. The magic of the Celts seems to have been in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/05162a.htm">druids</a>, who, though perhaps mainly diviners, appear also as magicians in Celtic heroic literature. As they wrote nothing, little is known of their magical lore. For modern magic amongst uncivilized races consult especially Skeat's "Malay Magic" (London, 1900).

<p>Magic as a practice finds no place in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, though the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the reality of magical powers has been held by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and individual <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> have been given to the practice. Two main reasons account for the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>: first, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of physical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. When the boundary between the physically possible and impossible was uncertain, some <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> were supposed to have gained almost limitless control over nature. Their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were attuned to the symphony of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the mystery of numbers and in consequence their powers exceeded the common understanding. This, however, was natural magic.

<p>But, secondly, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the frequency of diabolical interference with the forces of nature led easily to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in real magic. The early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were emphatically warned against the practice of it in the "Didache" (v, 1) and the letter of Barnabas (xx, 1). In fact it was condemned as a heinous crime. The danger, however, came not only from the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> world but also from the pseudo-Christian <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>. Although <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> and Elymas, that child of the devil (<a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs6">Acts 13:6 sqq.</a>) served as deterrent examples for all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, it took centuries to eradicate the propensity to magic. <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, St. Augustine, <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05498a.htm">St. Ephraem</a> inveighed against it. A more rational view of religion and nature had hardly gained ground, when the Germanic nations entered the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and brought with them the inclination for magic inherited from centuries of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>. No wonder that during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> wizardry was secretly practiced in many places notwithstanding innumerable decrees of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on the subject. Belief in the frequency of magic finally led to stringent measures taken against <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witchcraft</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> defines magic as <em>the art of performing actions beyond the power of man with the aid of powers other than the Divine</em>, and condemns it and any attempt at it as a grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the virtue of religion, because all magical performances, if undertaken seriously, are based on the expectation of interference by demons or lost <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Even if undertaken out of curiosity the performance of a magical <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> as it either proves a lack of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or is a vain <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> admits in principle the possibility of interference in the course of nature by spirits other than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but never without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> permission.
