<h1>Occurrence</h1>  

<p>(IN LITURGY)
<h2 id="section1">Definition</h2>

<p>Occurrence is the coinciding or occurring of two <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> offices on one and the same day; concurrence is the succession of two offices, so that the second vespers of one occur at the same time as the first vespers of the other. The chief causes of occurrence are: (1) the variableness of the feast and cycle of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, while the other feasts are fixed; (2) the annual change of the Dominical Letter, whereby Sunday falls successively on different dates of the same month (see <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">CALENDAR</a>; <a href="../cathen/05109a.htm">DOMINICAL LETTER</a>). Occurrence may be <em>accidental</em> or <em>perpetual</em>. <ul><li>(1) The calendar gives as a fixed feast for 28 May the feast of <a href="../cathen/02081a.htm">St. Augustine of Canterbury</a>; on the other hand on 28 May, 1891, the table of movable feasts marked that day as the feast of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>; thus on 28 May, 1891, these two offices fell on the same day &mdash; that is there was an occurrence. But as this coincidence was due to a variable cause, and did not happen the following years, the occurrence was <em>accidental</em>. <li>(2) The patronal feast of churches is celebrated with an octave; in the case of a church having St. Martin (11 November) as its patron, the octave day (18 November) falls on a fixed feast marked in the Calendar: "Dedication, etc . . ."; consequently, there is in such a church each year a coinciding of two offices on 18 November; this occurrence is said to be <em>perpetual</em>.</ul>
<h2 id="section2">Rules to be observed</h2>

<p>In case of an occurrence two questions arise: (1) Which office is to have the preference? (2) What is to be done concerning the less favoured office? <ul><li>(1) The two offices must be compared from the point of view of dignity and of necessity, taken either separately or together. As to dignity, <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, the Assumption, etc., prevail over the feasts of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; as to necessity, the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> being privileged prevails (if it falls on 30 November) over the Office of St. Andrew the Apostle; <em>a fortiori</em>, an office favoured by both conditions will be preferred. <li>(2) As to the less favoured office, it is treated differently according as the recurrence is perpetual or accidental. If perpetual, the authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> should intervene to operate a change that will be effectual each year; the mention of the feast is maintained on the day on which it falls, but the office is changed to the first free day (a day not occupied by another office, double or semi-double); <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgists</a> call this change <em>mutatio</em> (not <em>translatio</em>). When the occurrence is accidental, the compiler of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> ordo, with the approval of the ordinary, decides, in conformity with the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a>, what is to be done for the year. Either the office in question is transferable, in which the regulations of title X, "De translatione", are to be followed; or else it is not transferable, when it must be seen if it is to be omitted completely, or if a commemoration of it may be made on the day in question. The whole matter is provided for in the general <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>.</ul>

<p>To give an instance of concurrence, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> calendar marks the feast of <a href="../cathen/01556a.htm">St. Anthony of Padua</a> on 13 June, and that of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> on 14 June; these two feasts being of double rite have first and second <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>; on the evening of 13 June, therefore, the second <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> of St. Anthony and the first <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> of St. Basil happen at the same time, and there is said to be a concurrence of the two offices.
