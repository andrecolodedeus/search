<h1>Odo of Canterbury</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Battle, d. 1200, known as Odo Cantianus or of Kent. A <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Christ Church, he became subprior in 1163 and was sent by Thomas &agrave; Becket to Pope Alexander as his representative to attend an appeal, fixed for 18 Oct., 1163, against the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a> who, in spite of the remonstrances of St. Thomas and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, still continued to carry the cross in the southern province. In 1166 Christ Church appealed against the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> and Odo applied to Richard of Ilchester for help (<a href="../cathen/06556a.htm">Foliot</a>, Ep. 422, in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>). In 1167 he became prior with William as subprior. Until the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of St. Thomas he seems to have wavered in his allegiance between king and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, but then took a decided stand in favour of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. On 1 Sept., 1172, in a meeting the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Christ Church put forward Odo as worthy of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishopric</a>. The king however procrastinated, and no result followed a second meeting at <a href="../cathen/15654a.htm">Windsor</a> (6 Oct.). Odo with other <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> followed Henry to Normandy and urged that a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> should be chosen as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> (Mat. Becket., IV, 181). After protracted negotiations the choice fell upon Richard, Prior of Dover, formerly a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, in whose behalf Odo wrote to <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, CC., 1396). In 1173 occurred a great fire at Christ Church and Odo went to the Council of Woodstock on 1 July, 1175, to obtain a renewal of the charters on the model of those at <a href="../cathen/02350c.htm">Battle Abbey</a>. St. Martin de Bello had been without an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> for four years and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who attended the council caused Odo to be chosen. He was elected on 19 July. His blessing took place on 28 Sept., at the hands of Archbishop Richard at <a href="../cathen/16060a.htm">Malling</a>. On the death of Richard (1184) the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Christ Church again put Odo forward for the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishopric</a>, but Henry again refused, fearing no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he would be too inflexible for his purpose. Baldwin who was appointed quarreled with the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, a dispute which lasted til 1188 and occasioned a correspondence between Odo and <a href="../cathen/15211a.htm">Urban III</a> (Epp. Cantuar., no. 280). Odo died on 20 Jan., 1200, and was buried in the lower part of the church at <a href="../cathen/02350c.htm">Battle</a>. Leland speaks of him as a most erudite man and a great friend of Thomas &agrave; Becket and <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a> who describes him as an ardent lover of books. He was a great <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and preached in French, English, and Latin, and was noted for his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and modesty. There is some uncertainty as to his writings, owing to a confusion with <a href="../cathen/11212a.htm">Odo of Cheriton</a> and Odo of Murimund, but a list of thirteen works, chiefly writings on the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and sermons, can be ascribed to him. He was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> at <a href="../cathen/02350c.htm">Battle</a> as a saint and in the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> list at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> Cathedral is mentioned "a tooth of the Ven. Odo Abb. Of Battle" (Dart. Ap. XLVII).
