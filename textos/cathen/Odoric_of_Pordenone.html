<h1>Odoric of Pordenone</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> missionary of a Czech <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> named Mattiussi, born at Villanova near Pordenone, Friuli, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, about 1286; died at <a href="../cathen/15118a.htm">Udine</a>, 14 Jan., 1331. About 1300 he entered the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> at <a href="../cathen/15118a.htm">Udine</a>. Towards the middle of the thirteenth century the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> were commissioned by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to undertake missionary work in the interior of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. Among the missionaries sent there were John Piano Carpini, <a href="../cathen/13217a.htm">William Rubruquis</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08474a.htm">John of Montecorvino</a>. Odoric was called to follow them, and in April, 1318, started from Padua, crossed the Black Sea to <a href="../cathen/15028a.htm">Trebizond</a>, went through <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> by way of the Tauris, Sultaniah, where in 1318 <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> had erected an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, Kasham, Yezd, and Persepolis; he also visited Farsistan, Khuzistan, and Chaldea, and then went back to the Persian Gull. From Hormuz he went to Tana on the Island of Salsette, north of <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>. Here he gathered the remains of Thomas of Tolentino, Jacopo of Padua, Pietro of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, and Demetrius of Tiflis, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> who, a short time before, had suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and took them with him so as to bury them in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. From Salsette he went to <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>, Fondaraina (Flandrina) that lies north of Calicut, then to Cranganore that is south of Calicut, along the Coromandel Coast, then to Meliapur (Madras) and Ceylon. He then passed the Nicobar Islands on his way to Lamori, a kingdom of Sumoltra (Sumatra); he also visited Java, Banjarmasin on the southern coast of Borneo, and Tsiompa (Champa) in the southern part of Cochin China, and finally reached Canton in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>. From Canton he travelled to Zaitoum, the largest Chinese seaport in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and Che-kiang, and went overland by way of Fu-cheu, the capital of the province of Fokien, to Quinsay (Hangcheufu), celebrated by <a href="../cathen/12217a.htm">Marco Polo</a>. He remained in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> and went to Nanking, Yangchufu, and finally travelled by the great canal and the Hwangho River to Khan-balig or Peking, the capital of the Great Khan. At that time the aged Montecorvino was still <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in Peking, where Odoric remained three years. On his return journey he went overland by way of Chan-si through Tibet, from there apparently by way of Badachschan to the Tauris and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, reaching home in 1330.

<p>In May, 1330, at the request of his superior, Guidotto, Odoric dictated an account of his travels to Brother William of Solagna while at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Anthony at Padua. According to another version Henry of Glatz, who was at that time staying at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, made notes of the accounts given by Odoric's travelling companions and wrote them out at Prague in 1340. Unfortunately Odoric accepted many fabulous stories and for a long period it was <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> whether he had really seen all the places and regions he described. His narrative, though, is veracious, and he is the first <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> traveller from whom are learned many peculiarities of the Chinese people and country which <a href="../cathen/12217a.htm">Marco Polo</a> did not mention, because he had grown accustomed to them. It is to be regretted that he does not give a more detailed account of <a href="../cathen/14718a.htm">Tibet</a> and Lhasa, the capital of the Dalai-Lama, which he was the first <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> to enter. The account of his travels was widely spread by <a href="../cathen/09587b.htm">Mandeville's</a> plagiarisms from them, <a href="../cathen/09587b.htm">Mandeville's</a> work being exceedingly popular in the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and much used as a manual by geographers of that period. Numerous <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of Odoric's travels were current in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. They were first printed at <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a>. A Latin version appeared in <a href="../cathen/09639c.htm">Marcellino da Civezza's</a> "Storia universale delle missioni Francescane", III (Rome, 1859), 739-81; an English translation was made by Yule in his work "Cathay and the Way Thither", I (London, 1866), 1-162; a French version with very good notes was made by Henri Cordier "Les voyages en Asie au XIV<sup>e</sup> si&egrave;cle du bienheureux fr&egrave;re Odoric de Pordenone" (Paris, 1891).
