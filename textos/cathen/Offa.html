<h1>Offa</h1>  

<p>Offa, King of Mercia, died 29 July, 796. He was one of the leading figures of <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxon</a> history, as appears from the real facts stripped of all legend. He obtained the throne of Mercia in 757, after the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of his cousin, King &AElig;thelbald, by Beornraed. After spending fourteen years in consolidating and ordering his territories he engaged in conquests which made him the most powerful king in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. After a successful campaign against the Hestingi, he defeated the men of Kent at Otford (775); the West Saxons at Bensington in Oxfordshire (779); and finally the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a>, depriving the last-named of a large part of Powys, including the town of Pengwern. To repress the raids of the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a> he built Offa's dyke, roughly indicating for the first time what has remained the boundary between <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>. Offa was now supreme south of the Humber, with the result that <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was divided into three political divisions, Northumbria, Mercia, and Wessex. His next step was to complete the independence of Mercia by inducing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to erect a Mercian <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, so as to free Mercia from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Hadrian I</a> sent two <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, George and Theophylactus, to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to arrange for the transfer of five suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> (viz. <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, Leicester, Lindsay, Elmham, and Dunwich) to the new Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>, of which Higbert was first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. This was effected at the Synod of Celchyth (787), at which Offa granted the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a yearly sum equal to one mancus a day for the relief of the poor and for lights to be kept burning before St. Peter's <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. At the same time he associated his son Ecgferth with him in the kingship. He preserved friendly relations with <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, who undertook to protect the English <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> and merchants who passed through his territories. Many charters granting lands to various <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are extant, and, though some are forgeries, enough are genuine documents to show that he was a liberal benefactor to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of Offa are not extant, but were embodied by Alfred in his later code. The chief stain on his character is the execution of &AElig;thelbert, King of the East Angles. In all other respects he showed himself a great <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> king and an able and enlightened ruler.
