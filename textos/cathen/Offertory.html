<h1>Offertory</h1>  

<p>(Offertorium.)

<p>The <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rite</a> by which the bread and wine are presented (offered) to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> before they are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/09304a.htm">chant</a> that accompany it.
<h2 id="section1">History</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of this preparatory hallowing of the matter of the sacrifice by offering it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is very old and forms an important element of every <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Christian liturgy</a>. In the earliest period we have no evidence of anything but the bringing up of the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> as they are wanted, before the Consecration <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin Martyr</a> says: "Then bread and a cup of water and wine are brought to the president of the brethren" (I Apol., lxv, cf, lxvii). But soon the placing of the offering on the altar was accompanied by a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should accept these gifts, sanctify them, change them into the Body and Blood of his Son, and give us in return the grace of Communion. The Liturgy of "Apost. Const." VIII, says: "The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> bring the gifts to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at the altar . . . (xii, 3-4). This silent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is undoubtedly an Offertory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. But a later modification in the East brought about one of the characteristic differences between Eastern and Roman <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>. All Eastern (and the old Gallican) rites prepare the gift before the Liturgy begins. This <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> (<em>proskomide</em>) is especially elaborate in the Byzantine and its derived rites. It takes place on the credence table. The <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> are arranged, divided, <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a>; and many <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are said over them involving the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of an offertory. The gifts are left there and are brought to the altar in solemn procession at the beginning of the Liturgy of the Faithful. This leaves no room for another offertory then. However, when they are placed on the altar <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are said by the celebrant and a <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litany</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> which repeat the offertory <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> alone has kept the older custom of one offertory and of preparing the gifts when they are wanted at the beginning of the Mass of the Faithful. Originally at this moment the people brought up <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> which were received by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and placed by them on the altar. Traces of the custom remain at a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Mass and at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. The office of the <em>vecchioni</em> in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, often quoted as an Ambrosian peculiarity, is really a Roman addition that spoils the order of the <a href="../cathen/01394a.htm">old Milanese rite</a>. Originally the only Roman Offertory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were the secrets. The Gregorian Sacramentary contains only the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a>: "deinde offertorium, et dicitur oratio super oblata" (P.L. LXXVIII, 25). The <em>Oratio super oblata</em> is the Secret. All the old secrets express the offertory <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> clearly. They were said silently by the celebrant (hence their name) and so are not introduced by <em>Oremus</em>. This corresponds to the oldest custom mentioned in the "Apost. Const."; its reason is that meanwhile the people sang a psalm (the Offertory chant). In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, as the public presentation of the gifts by the people had disappeared, there seemed to be a void at this moment which was filled by our present Offertory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> (<a href="../cathen/14554a.htm">Thalhofer</a>, op. cit. below, II, 161). For a long time these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were considered a private devotion of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, like the preparation at the foot of the altar. They are a Northern (late Gallican) addition, not part of the old <a href="../cathen/13155a.htm">Roman Rite</a>, and were at first not written in <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">missals</a>. Micrologus says: "The Roman order appointed no <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> after the Offertory before the Secret" (cxi, P.L., CLI, 984). He mentions the later Offertory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> as a "Gallican order" and says that they occur "not from any law but as an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> custom". The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Offertory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> vary considerably. They were established at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the fourteenth century (Ordo Rom. XIV., 53, P.L. LXXVIII, 1165). The present Roman <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were compiled from various sources, Gallican or Mozarabic. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> "Suscipe sancte pater" occurs in Charles the Bald's (875-877) <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> book; "Deus qui human&aelig; substanti&aelig;" is modified from a <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> Collect in the Gregorian Sacramentary (P.L., LXXVIII, 32): "Offerimus tibi Domine" and "Veni sanctificator" (fragment of an old <a href="../cathen/05502a.htm">Epiklesis</a>, Hoppe, "Die Epiklesis", Schaffhausen, 1864, p. 272) are Mozarabic (P.L. LXXXV, 112). Before <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V's</a> <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were often preceded by the title "Canon minor" or "Secretella" (as amplifications of the Secret). The <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> (1570) printed them in the Ordinary. Since then the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> form part of the Roman Mass. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> expressed in them are obvious. Only it may be noted that two expressions: "hanc immaculatam hostiam" and "calicem salutaris" dramatically anticipate the moment of <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, as does the Byzantine Cherubikon.

<p>While the Offertory is made the people (choir) sing a verse (the <em>Offertorium</em> in the sense of a text to be sung) that forms part of the Proper of the Mass. No such chant is mentioned in "Apost. Const."; VIII, but it may no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> be supposed as the reason why the celebrant there too <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> silently. It is referred to by St. Augustine (Retract., II, xi, P.L., XXXII, 63). The Offertorium was once a whole psalm with an antiphon. By the time of the <a href="../cathen/01579a.htm">Gregorian Antiphonary</a> the psalm has been reduced to a few verses only, which are always given in that book (e.g., P.L., LXXVIII, 641). So also the Second Roman Ordo: "Canitur offertorium cum versibus" (ib., 972). Durandus notes with disapproval that in his time the verses of the psalm are left out (Rationale, IV, 26). Now only the antiphon is sung, except at requiems. It is taken from the psalter, or other book of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, or is often not a Biblical text. It refers in some way to the feast or occasion of the Mass, never to the offering of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>. Only the requiem has preserved a longer offertory with one verse and the repetition of the last part of the antiphon (the text is not Biblical).
<h2 id="section2">Present use</h2>

<p>At high Mass, as soon as the celebrant has chanted the <em>Oremus</em> followed by no <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the choir sings the Offertory. When they have finished there remains an interval till the <a href="../cathen/12384a.htm">Preface</a> which may (when the <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a> is permitted) be filled by music of the <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organ</a> or at any time by singing some approved <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> or chant. Meanwhile the celebrant first says the Offertory chant. The <a href="../cathen/04386c.htm">corporal</a> has been spread on the altar during the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> brings the empty <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> with the bread from the credence table to the altar. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> hands the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> and bread to the celebrant. He takes it and holding it up says the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: "suscipe sancte Pater". At the end he makes a <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> with the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> over the altar and slips the bread from it on to the corporal. Soon after the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> is given to the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon's</a> charge till it is wanted again for the fraction. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> pours wine into the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> water, which is first blessed by the celebrant with the form: "Deus qui human&aelig; substanti&aelig;". The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> hands the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> to the celebrant, who, holding it up, says the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: "Offerimus tibi Domine". The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> also lays his right hand on the foot of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and says this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with the celebrant &#151; a relic of the old <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> is in his care. The celebrant makes the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and stands it behind the bread on the corporal. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> covers it with the pall. The celebrant, bowing down, his hands joined and resting on the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, says the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: "In spiritu humilitatis"; rising he says the "Veni sanctificator" making the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> over all the <em>oblata</em> at the word <em>benedic</em>. Then follows the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensing</a> of the altar and the <a href="../cathen/09044b.htm">Lavabo</a>. The use of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> at this point is <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> and not originally Roman (remnant of the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> at the Gallican procession of the <em>oblata</em>?). Micrologus notes that the Roman order uses <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> at the Gospel, not at the Offertory; but he admits that in his time (eleventh century) the <em>oblata</em> are <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensed</a> by nearly everyone (De Exxl. Observ., IX). Finally, after the Lavabo the celebrant at the middle of the altar, looking up and then bowing down, says the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> "Suscipe sancta Trinitas" which sums up the Offertory <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. The <em>Orate fratres</em> and secrets follow.

<p>At low <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>, the parts of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> are taken partly by the server and partly by the celebrant himself. There is no <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>. At requiems the water is not blessed, and the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> does not hold the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> still prepare the offering before Mass begins. This is one of their Gallican peculiarities and so goes back to the Eastern Proskomide. The <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> and Mozarabic Missals have adopted the Roman Offertory. The accompanying chant is called <em>Sacrificium</em> at Toledo.
