<h1>Oil of Saints</h1>  

<p>(Manna Oil of Saints).

<p>An oily substance, which is said to have flowed, or still flows, from the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> or burial places of certain <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; sometimes the oil in the lamps that burn before their shrines; also the water that flows from the wells near their burial places; or the oil and the water which have in some way come in contact with their <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. These oils are or have been used by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that they will cure bodily and spiritual ailments, not through any intrinsic power of their own, but through the intercession of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> with whom the oils have some connection. In the days of the <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">St. Paulinus of Nola</a> (d. 431) the custom prevailed of pouring oil over the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> or <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquaries</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and then gathering it in vases, sponges, or pieces of cloth. This oil, oleum martyris, was distributed among the faithful as a remedy against sickness ["Paulini Nolani Carmen," XVIII, lines 38-40 and "Carmen," XXI, lines 590-600, in "Corpus Script. Eccl. Latinorum" (Vienna, 1866 sq.), XXX, 98, 177]. According to the testimony of Paulinus of P&eacute;trigeux (wrote about 470) in Gaul this custom was extended also to the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> that did not die as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, especially to the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a> ("Paulini Petricordi&aelig; Carmen de vita S. Martini," V, 101 sq. in "Corpus Script. Eccl. Lat., " XVI, 111). In their accounts of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, wrought through the application of oils of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers do not always state just what kind of oils of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is meant. Thus St. Augustine (<a href="../fathers/120122.htm"><em>City of God</em> XXII</a>) mentions that a dead man was brought to life by the agency of the oil of St. Stephen.
<h2>The oil of St. Walburga</h2>

<p>At present the most famous of the oils of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is the Oil of <a href="../cathen/15526b.htm">St. Walburga</a> (<em>Walburgis oleum</em>). It flows from the stone slab and the surrounding metal plate on which rest the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/15526b.htm">St. Walburga</a> in her church in Eichst&auml;dt in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. The fluid is caught in a silver cup, placed beneath the slab for that purpose, and is distributed among the faithful in small vials by the Sisters of St. Benedict, to whom the church belongs. A chemical analysis has shown that the fluid contains nothing but the ingredients of water. Though the origin of the fluid is probably due to natural causes, the fact that it came in contact with the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> justifies the practice of using it as a remedy against diseases of the body and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Mention of the oil of <a href="../cathen/15526b.htm">St. Walburga</a> is made as early as the ninth century by her biographer Wolfhard of Herrieden ("Acta SS., " Feb., III, 562-3 and "Mon. Germ. Script., " XV, 535 sq.).
<h2>The oil of St. Menas</h2>

<p>In 1905-8, thousands of little flasks with the inscription: <em>EULOGIA TOU AGIOU MENA</em> (Remembrance of <a href="../cathen/10178d.htm">St. Menas</a>), or the like were excavated by C.M. Kaufmann at Baumma (Karm Abum) in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Mareotis, in the northern part of the Libyan <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. The present Bumma is the burial place of the Libyan <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Menas, which during the fifth and perhaps the sixth century was one of the most famous <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> places in the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a>. The flasks of <a href="../cathen/10178d.htm">St. Menas</a> were well known for a long time to archeologists, and had been found not only in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, but also in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, whither they had been brought by <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> from the shrine of Menas. Until the discoveries of Kaufmann, however, the flasks were supposed to have contained oil from the lamps that burned at the sepulchre of Menas. From various inscriptions on the flasks that were excavated by Kaufmann, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that at least some, if not all, of them contained water from a holy well near the shrine of <a href="../cathen/10178d.htm">St. Menas</a>, and were given as remembrances to the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. The so-called oil of <a href="../cathen/10178d.htm">St. Menas</a> was therefore in reality, water from his holy well, which was used as a remedy against bodily and spiritual ailments.
<h2>The oil of St. Nicholas of Myra</h2>

<p>This is the fluid which emanates from his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> at <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, whither they were brought in 1087. It is said to have also flowed from his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> when they were still in <a href="../cathen/10661a.htm">Myra</a>. (<em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">SAINT NICHOLAS OF MYRA</a>).
<h2>Other saints</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">St. Gregory of Tours</a> ("De Gloria martyrum," xxx, P.L., LXXI, 730) testifies that a certain substance like flour emanated from the sepulchre of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John the Evangelist</a>. The same <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory</a> writes (ibid., xxxi) that from the sepulchre of the Apostle St. Andrew at Patr&aelig; emanated <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">manna</a> in the form of flour and fragrant oil.

<p>Following is a list of other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> from whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> or sepulchres oil is said to have flowed at certain times: <ul> <li>St. Antipas, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11666a.htm">Pergamum</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> under <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Emperor Domitian</a> ("Acta SS., " April, II, 4); <li>St. Babolenus, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St-Maur-des-Foss&eacute;s near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, d. in the seventh century ("Acta SS., " June, VII, 160); <li>St. Candida the Younger of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, d. 586 ("Acta SS., " Sept., II, 230); <li>St. Demetrius of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in 306 or 290 ("Acta SS., " Oct., IV, 73-8); <li>St. Eligius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Noyon, d. 660 or soon after (<a href="../cathen/14343c.htm">Surius</a>, "De probatis sanctorum historiis," VI, 678); <li>St. Euthymius the Great, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> in Palestine, d. 473 ("Acta SS., " Jan., II, 687); <li>St. Fantinus, confessor, at Tauriano in Calabria, d. under <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> ("Acta SS., " July, V, 556); <li><a href="../cathen/06033b.htm">St. Felix of Nola</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, died about 260 ("Acta SS., " Jan., II, 223); <li>St. Franca, <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>, d. 1218 ("Acta SS., " April, III, 393-4); <li>St. Glyceria, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> during the reign of <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus Pius</a> ("Acta SS., " May, III, 191); <li>Bl.
