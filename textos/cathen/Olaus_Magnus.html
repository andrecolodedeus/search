<h1>Olaus Magnus</h1>  

<p>Swedish historian and geographer, b. at Skeninge, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, 1490; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1 Aug., 1558 [or perhaps 1557 &#151; <em>Ed.</em>]. He belonged to the old and noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Store (i.e. great, <em>magnus</em>), and pursued his studies from 1510 to 1517 in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He was then, like his brother John Magnus, taken into the higher <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> service, and made <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> at <a href="../cathen/16076b.htm">Strengnas</a>. In 1523 King Gustave I named John <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15207a.htm">Upsala</a>, and sent Olaus to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to have the appointment confirmed. After vain efforts to prevent the king from introducing the new doctrines into <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, John went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1537, and Olaus accompanied him as secretary, having by his fidelity to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> lost his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in the confiscation of church goods. When John died in 1544, Olaus was appointed his successor in <a href="../cathen/15207a.htm">Upsala</a>, but never entered into office, spending the rest of his life in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, for the most part in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. From 1545 to 1549 he attended the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, having been commissioned to that <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> by the side of his brother in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>.

<p>His works, which mark him as one of the most important geographers of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> period, were published in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the North, which was so extensive that he was the first to suggest the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a north-east passage, enabled him to produce after years of labour a great map of the lands in the North. It appeared at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1539 with the title "Carta marina et descriptio septentrionalium terrarum ac mirabilium rerum", and included the area from the south coast of <a href="../cathen/06777b.htm">Greenland</a> to the Russian coasts of the Baltic, including Iceland, the northern isles, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, and Finland. In this map we have the first general fairly definite representation of the North, surpassing every attempt contained in the Ptolemaic editions. The work was regarded for a long time as lost, and a single copy, procured in the sixteenth century and preserved in the Royal and National <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, was only found in 1886 by Oscar Brenner. The <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> University <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> has a rough copy done by hand. Niccol&ograve; Zeno, the younger, in 1558, used the exact data given by the map to publish an account of a northern journey supposed to have been undertaken by his ancestors in 1400. This work created a sensation, and not until some time later recognized as a fiction. Sebastian M&uuml;nster, Gastaldi, and <a href="../cathen/11328b.htm">Ortelius</a> also turned the map to good account. Olaus Magnus likewise compiled an important work dealing with history, geography, and natural history: "Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus" (Rome, 1555; Antwerp, 1558; Basle, 1567; Frankfort, 1618, Translations: German (Strasburg and Basle, 1567); Italian (Venice, 1565); English (London, 1658); <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, (Amsterdam, 1665). It is divided into twenty-two books, and deals picturesquely and successively with the manners and customs, the commercial and political life of northern nations, the physical proportions of the land and its minerals and zoology. Olaus also published a life of Catharine, daughter of the <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedish</a> St. Bridget, "Vita Catharinae", as well as another work, "Vita abbreviata S. Briggitae". He edited the following works of his brother John: "Historia Gothorum libris XXIV" (Rome, 1554), and the "Historia Metropolitana, seu Episcoporum et Archiepiscoporum Upsaliensium" (Rome, 1557).
