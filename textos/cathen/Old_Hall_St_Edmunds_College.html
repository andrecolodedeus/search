<h1>Old Hall (St. Edmund's College)</h1>  

<p>Located near Ware, Hertfordshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; founded in 1793 after the fall of the English College, <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French revolution</a>, to carry on for the south of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the same work of training <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for the English mission, and of affording a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to lay students. It was the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the "London district" until 1850, when it became the joint <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the Sees of Westminster. The foundation took place on 16 November, 1793, the feast of St. Edmund, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, when Bishop Douglass reassembled at Old Hall four of the <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> students, and as he states in his diary, "commenced studies or established the new college there, a substitute for <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>." He chose Old Hall for this purpose because there was already existing there a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> belonging to the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, founded in 1749 at Standon Lordship in the same county and removed in 1769 to Old Hall, purchased by <a href="../cathen/14432a.htm">Bishop Talbot</a>. A timely legacy of ten thousand pounds from John Sone, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, enabled Bishop Douglass to build a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, blessed by him on 29 September, 1799. A <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and refectory were added in 1805 by his successor, Bishop Poynter, who succeeded Dr. Stapleton as president in 1801. The college prospered, particularly under the rule of Thomas Griffiths (1818-34), afterwards <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. He built a larger <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, designed in the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style by <a href="../cathen/12001a.htm">Augustus Welby Pugin</a> and remarkable for the beautiful rood-screen, but he did not live to see the opening of it in 1853, when it was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a>, whose attempts to place the college under the direction of the Oblates of St. Charles led to serious troubles. Connected to these was the appointment of <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Dr. Herbert Vaughan</a> (<a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>) as vice-president of the college (1855-61). After the death of <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a>, <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Archbishop Manning</a> decided to remove the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, and from 1869 the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was conducted simply as a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys; but in 1905 Archbishop Bourne decided to send back the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> students. There is now accommodation for 250 students; the college grounds cover 400 acres. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> contains a <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of St. Edmund, and the museum many interesting <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the English College, <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, and of the penal days. Two <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> councils have been held at the college, the synod of the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> in 1803 and the Fourth <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of Westminster in 1873.
