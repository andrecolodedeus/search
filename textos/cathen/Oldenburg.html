<h1>Oldenburg</h1>  

<p>A grand duchy, one of the twenty-six federated states of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. It consists of three widely separated parts: the duchy of Oldenburg; the principality of L&uuml;beck, situated between Holstein and Mecklenburg; and the principality of Birkenfeld, in <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Rhenish Prussia</a>. The duchy is bounded by the North Sea, and by <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, It has an area of 2571 sq. miles and (1 Dec., 1905) 438,856 inhabitants. Oldenburg has 2134 sq. miles and 353,789 inhabitants; L&uuml;beck, 217 sq. miles and 38,583 inhabitants; and Birkenfeld, 202 sq. miles and 46,484 inhabitants.

<p>There were in 1905, in Oldenburg: <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 86,865; <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, 264,805; other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, 1163; <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, 956; in L&uuml;beck: <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 485; <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, 38,064; other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, 11; <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, 23; in Birkenfeld: <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 8717; <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, 37,047; other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, 177; <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, 543. In the entire grand duchy: 96,067 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 399,916 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, 1351 other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, 1522 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The percentage of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> among the total population is now 21.9; in 1871 it was 22.4. The cause of this lies in the emigration of a part of the agricultural population to the industrial districts of the neighbouring provinces.

<p>The capital is Oldenburg. In that part of the country facing the North Sea, the population is of Frisian descent; further inland it is Low Saxon, The chief rivers are the Weser and the Hunte. Of great importance to the country are the numerous canals. The chief industries are agriculture, cattle raising, horse breeding, peat-cutting, and fishing. The country's industrial establishments include brick factories, banquette manufacture, shipbuilding, metal and iron works, distilleries of alcohol from rye and potatoes. The most important articles of commerce are cattle, grain, lumber, etc.

<p>The country takes its name from the castle of Oldenburg, erected about the middle of the twelfth century. The founder of the reigning house was Egilmar, who is first mentioned in a document <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1088. His territory, of which the Duke of Saxony was the liege lord, was situated between the country of the Saxons and the Frisians. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with the latter lasted for several centuries, and it was not until 1234 that one of their tribes (the Stedingians) succumbed to the Oldenburg attacks in the battle of Altenesch. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> was in these <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> an ally of the counts of Oldenburg. When the famous Saxon duke, Henry the Lion, was forced to flee and the old Dukedom of Saxony was partitioned by <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a> in 1181, the counts of Oldenburg obtained the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of princes of the Empire, but took little part in its development and progress. Of great importance later on was the marriage which Count Dietrich the Fortunate (died 1440), concluded with Heilwig of Schauenburg (Schaumburg). Two sons issued from this marriage, Christian and Gerhard the Valiant. Through the influence of his uncle, Duke Adolf VIII of <a href="../cathen/13542a.htm">Schleswig</a>, Heilwig's eldest son, Christian, became King of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> in 1448, King of <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> in 1450, and King of Sweden in 1457. This last royal crown Christian lost again in 1471. He became, after the death of Duke Adolf, Duke of <a href="../cathen/13542a.htm">Schleswig</a> and Count of Holstein. Christian became the ancestor of the House of Holstein-Oldenburg, branches of which are reigning today in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and Oldenburg.

<p>The ancestral lands of Oldenburg were turned over by Christian in 1458 to his brother Gerhard the Valiant. The <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> gave Oldenburg as a fief to Count Anton I in 1531. The main line became extinct with the death of Count Anton G&uuml;nther (1603-67). After lengthy quarrels over the succession, Christian V of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> became ruler of Oldenburg in 1676. In 1773, however, the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> King Christian VII surrendered Oldenburg to the Grand Duke Paul of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, in consideration of the latter's renunciation of the sovereignty of Schleswig-Holstein. Grand Duke Paul transferred the country, which was raised to a dukedom in 1777, to his cousin Frederick Augustus. The latter, who although a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, was Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/09401a.htm">L&uuml;beck</a> since 1750, added the territory of the former <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Bishopric of L&uuml;beck to Oldenburg. Because William, the son of Frederick Augustus, was insane, Peter, first cousin of Frederick Augustus, succeeded the latter in the administration of the dukedom. The succeeding rulers of the country are descended from this Peter. When <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> in 1810 united the entire German North Sea districts with his empire, he decided to indemnify the Duke of Oldenburg for his loss by giving him other districts in <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>. But because the duke refused those districts, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> punished him by taking possession of all Oldenburg in 1811 and by embodying it in the Departments of Weserm&uuml;ndung and Oberems. The battle of Leipzig in 1813 brought liberty to Oldenburg. Peter again grasped the reins of government. The resolutions of the <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> Congress raised Oldenburg to the dignity of a grand duchy and enlarged it by adding to it a part of the French Department of the Saar, the old Wittelsbach Principality of Birkenfeld. After the establishment of the German Federation in 1815, Oldenburg became a member of it. In the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> in 1866 Oldenburg added its troops to the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> army of the Main; later on it joined the North German Federation and in 1871 the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a> as an independent state. The reigning grand duke since 1900 is Frederick Augustus (born 16 Nov., 1852).

<p>The larger part of the country was <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, and especially through the efforts of St. Willebaldus, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> in 787. Until the introduction of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> confession in 1529 by Count Anton I, this district was united with the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>. The reformation here destroyed almost all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life. The southern parts of the duchy, which consist today of the administrative districts of Cloppenburg and Vechta, were outlying missions of the Osnabr&uuml;ck Diocese, attended from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> at Visbeck and Meppen, which had been established by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. These parts, the pastoral care of which chiefly devolved on the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Corvey, were subject to the Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a> from 1252 until 1803 under the name of "Niederstift" and, therefore, remained <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> during the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> period. The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> over the Niederstift was exercised by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a> and not by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>. In 1688 the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a> was transferred to M&uuml;nster. These districts were ceded to Oldenburg in the conference of the federal deputies in 1803. In the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> "De salute animarum", 16 July, 1821, in regard to the establishment and limitation of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, all Oldenburg was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of M&uuml;nster; however, there were very few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the northern part of the country.



<p>The principality of L&uuml;beck is a part of the Vicariate Apostolic of the Northern Missions. The Principality of Birkenfeld belongs to the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>. The plan of Grand Duke Paul to have a separate <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> for Oldenburg failed on account of financial difficulties. The relations between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> were adjusted by the convention of 5 Jan., 1830. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic delegate</a> to these deliberations was the Prince-Bishop of <a href="../cathen/05522a.htm">Ermland</a>, Joseph of Hohenzollern. The supreme guidance of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Oldenburg was entrusted to the substitute (<em>Offizial</em>) of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, who resided in Vechta. The resolutions of the convention became <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> by order of the grand ducal cabinet of 5 April, 1831, under the title "Fundamentalstatut der katholischen Kirche in Oldenburg". Simultaneously there was published "Normativ zur Wahrung der landesherrlichen Majest&auml;tsrechte circa sacra" (Regulations for the maintenance of the ducal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> <em>circa sacra</em>), of which no notice had been given to the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>.

<p>These regulations created "a commission for the defence of State rights against the Catholic Church", which exists to this day, and which is composed of two higher State officials, one of whom usually is a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and the other a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. The work of the commission includes all negotiations between the government and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, particularly those relating to the appointment of the <em>Offizial</em>, his assessors and his secretary as well as the two <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>; furthermore all negotiations between the government and the <em>Offizial</em>, such as those relating to the appointment of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the establishment of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>. The commission furthermore must approve every sale or mortgage of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. The regulations further decreed that all <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> and episcopal edicts must be approved by the grand duke before their publication in Oldenburg, and that they shall not be valid without such an approval. On account of this one-sided <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> measure a long controversy arose between the government and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>. The position of <em>Offizial</em> at Vechta was vacant from 1846 to 1853. In 1852 Oldenburg received a constitution. This led to an amelioration in the relations between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, the ducal <em>placet</em> was abolished and every <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community or <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> was permitted to conduct its affairs independently and without interference; <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> was distinctly guaranteed. But as the approval of the government was required for the appointment of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> officials, the conflict continued.

<p>The negotiations, begun in Dec., 1852, between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a> and the government, dragged along almost twenty years. During this conflict the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <em>Offizial</em> did not appoint any <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; only temporary <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> were placed in charge of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in which vacancies occurred. In 1868 an agreement was reached according to which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> filled <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> vacancies after an understanding in each case with the Government, and they further agreed that the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be communicated to the Government simultaneously with their publication. Several minor points in dispute were settled in 1872. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Oldenburg were not affected by the severe trials of the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em>. Grand Duke Peter openly disapproved of the persecutions and of the severity with which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was treated in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>.

<p>The Oldenburg part of the <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">Diocese of M&uuml;nster</a> consists today of two deaconries, Cloppenburg and Vechta. The Deaconry of Cloppenburg numbers 38,678 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 6952 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and 28 Hebrews; the 18 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the <em>Aemter</em> Cloppenburg and Friesoythe also belong to it. The Deaconry of Vechta numbers 53,308 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, 264,169 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, 987 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; it includes the other 18 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the country. The <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> funds for the payment of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> expenses were partly taken from the income of several so-called commanderies in the <em>Amt</em> Friesoythe which formerly belonged to the Order of Malta. The State sequestrated these and other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> possessions in the beginning of the nineteenth century, but agreed to turn over the annual income to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which it has done to this day. Including these revenues the State pays annually about 22,000 Marks for the use of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1910 the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> obtained the right of levying church-taxes. The State does not forbid the foundation of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> have a boarding college at Vechta, and the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> a house in M&uuml;hlen, near Steinfeld. Of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> congregations there are 7 houses belonging to the sisters of the third order of St. Francis; 4 houses of the Sisters of Charity; 7 houses of the Sisters of Our Lady; 1 house of the Poor <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> Of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary; 1 house of the <a href="../cathen/07031a.htm">Grey Nuns</a> of St. Elizabeth; in all there are 20 houses of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> congregations. The sisters nurse the sick, or teach in their own <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Until 1855 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were under church control.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1855 secularized the entire <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> system including the secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> system and the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> system are each under a separate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> board. The episcopal "Offizial" is president of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> board which controls the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> "Gymnasium" at Vechta, the high school at Cloppenburg, the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> teachers at Vechta, and all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. On 4 Feb., 1910, a new <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> law went into effect. It does away with the hitherto existing <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> superintendence of public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Only the religious instruction is supervised by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, who is a member of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> board. If there are more than twenty-five <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children in a community which has only a <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, a separate <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> must be established by the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, should the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> request it.

<p>The ancient Diocese of Oldenburg has no connexion with the country of Oldenburg, or with its principal city. The country of Oldenburg was never subject to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> of the Diocese of Oldenburg. The Bishopric of Oldenburg was founded by the German <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Emperor Otto I</a> about 950, and comprised the present territory of Holstein, The small town of Oldenburg (also called Aldenburg in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>), near the coast of the Baltic Sea, which is still in existence, was the ancient seat of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The Diocese of Oldenburg was suffragan to the Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>; during the great revolt of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> peoples in 1066, it ceased to exist, but was re-established in 1149 as the See of St. Vicelin, a missionary among the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>.
