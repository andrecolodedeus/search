<h1>Olivetans</h1>  

<p>A branch of the white <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>, founded in 1319. It owed its origin to the ascetic fervour of Giovanni Tolomei (St. Bernard Ptolomei), a gentleman of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> and professor of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. He is said to have vowed himself to religion in gratitude for the recovery of his eyesight through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin. In fulfilment of this <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> he left his home (1313) and went into the wilderness, to forsake the world and give himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Two companions of his, Ambrogio Piccolomini and Patricio Patrici, <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienese</a> senators, accompanied him. They settled on a bit of land belonging to Tolomei. It was a mountain top, exactly suited to the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life. Here they devoted themselves to austerities. Apparently they were somewhat aggressive in their asceticism; for, six years later, they were accused of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and summoned to give an explanation of their innovations before <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. The two disciples &mdash; Tolomei remained behind&mdash;obeyed the mandate and succeeded in gaining the good-will of the Holy Father, who, however, in order to bring them into line with other <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, bade them go to Guido di Pietromala, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a>, and ask him to give them a Rule which had the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> remembered that once, in a vision or dream, <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> had put into his hands the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> and bade him give white habits to some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">knelt</a> before her. He did not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that these <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were the <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienese</a> <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> commended to his care by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Wherefore, he clothed the three of them with white habits and gave them the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Benedictine Rule</a> and placed them under the protection of the Blessed Virgin. Tolomei took the name of Bernard and their olive- clothed mountain hermitage was renamed "Monte Oliveto", in memory of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's agony</a> and as a perpetual reminder to themselves of the life of sacrifice and expiatory penance they had undertaken.

<p>Evidently, in what he did, the good <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had before his mind the history of St. Romuald &mdash; there is even a repetition of the well- known "Vision of St. Romuald" in the story&mdash;and hoped, through the enthusiasm of Bernard and his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, to witness another wide- spread monastic revival, like that which spread from the Hermitage of Camaldoli. He was not disappointed. Through the generosity of a merchant a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was erected at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>; he himself built another at <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a>; a third sprang up at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>; and within a very few years there were establishments at Camprena, <a href="../cathen/15504b.htm">Volterra</a>, San Geminiano, Eugubio, <a href="../cathen/06124b.htm">Foligno</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Before St. Bernard's death from the plague in 1348&mdash;he had quitted his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to devote himself to the care of those stricken with the disease and died a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of charity &mdash; the new congregation was already in great repute, as well for the number of its houses and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> as for the saintliness of its members and the rigour of its observance. Yet it never succeeded in planting itself successfully on the other side of the Alps.

<p>St. Bernard Ptolomei's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of monastic reform was that which had inspired every founder of an order or congregation since the days of St. Benedict&mdash;a return to the primitive life of solitude and austerity. Severe corporal <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortifications</a> were <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by rule and inflicted in public. The usual <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and conventual <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> were largely increased and the daily food was bread and water. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> slept on a straw mattress without bed-coverings, and did not lie down after the midnight Office, but continued in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> until Prime. They wore wooden sandals and habits of the coarsest stuff. They were also fanatical total abstainers; not only was St. Benedict's kindly concession of a hemina of wine rejected, but the vineyards were rooted up and the wine-presses and vessels destroyed. Attention has been called to this last particular, chiefly to contrast with it a provision of the later constitutions, in which the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> are told to keep the best wine for themselves and sell the inferior product ("meliora vina pro monachorum usu serventur, pejora vendantur") and, should they have to buy wine, to purchase only the better quality ("si vinum emendum erit, emetur illud quod melius erit"). Truly, relaxation was inevitable. It was never reasonable that the heroic austerities of St. Bernard and his companions should be made the rule, then and always, for every <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the order. But the mandate concerning the quality of the wine chiefly aimed to remove any excuse for differential treatment of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in meat and drink. Where everything on the table was of exceptional quality, there could be no reason why anyone should be especially provided for. It was always the custom for each one to dilute the wine given him.

<p>Though the foundation of the Olivetans was not professedly an introduction of constitutional reform among the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, it had that result. They were a new creation and hence, as we may see, up-to-date. They had a superior general, like the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, and officials of the order distinct from those of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. They set an example of adaptation to present needs by the frequent modification of their constitutions at the general chapters, and by the short term of office enjoyed by the superiors. In 1408 <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> gave them the extinct <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Justina at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, which they occupied until the institution there of the famous <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> reform. This great movement out of which the present Cassinese Congregation resulted, may, therefore, in a very literal sense, be described as having followed in the footsteps of the Olivetans. At the present date, the Order of Our Lady of Mount Olivet numbers only 10 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and 122 brethren.
