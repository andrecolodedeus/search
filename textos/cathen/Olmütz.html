<p>(OLOMUCENSIS)

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>. It is probable that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> penetrated into <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a> as early as the fourth century, but the invasions of the Huns and Avars destroyed these beginnings. Towards the end of the eighth century the Northern <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> immigrated into this region. Their leader, Rastislav, asked for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missionaries, not from the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, but from the Greek emperor, Michael III, who sent the brothers Cyril and Methodius, born in Thessalonica but speaking the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> tongue and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in Constantinople. Cyril, known as "the Philosopher", had been a missionary among the Chazars, and had discovered near the Inkermann the body of Clement I, whose transfer to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> through <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> and Pannonia is marked to this day by three Moravian and eighteen <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> churches dedicated to St. Clement. The preaching of the missionary brothers was successful. Cyril invented the <a href="../cathen/06575b.htm">Glagolitic</a> alphabet and translated the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> into <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a>. What is today called <a href="../cathen/06575b.htm">"Cyrillic" (Glagolitic)</a> script owes its origin to his pupil Clement, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Welica. German <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> became jealous of the success of the two <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> apostles and accused them at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but <a href="../cathen/01156a.htm">Adrian II</a> gave them permission to use the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> language for religious services. Cyril died in a Roman <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, while Methodius became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Pannonia and Moravia. Despite his high <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignity</a> he was insulted at a Synod of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> and kept a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> for two and a half years. He laboured faithfully and successfully in Moravia under the reign of Swatopluk, justified himself repeatedly when accused before <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a>, and died 6 April, 885, at Velehrad on the March.

<p>The Moravian kingdom soon (906) fell before the onslaught of the Hungarians, and the name Moravia for a long time disappears from history. In the report sent by Pilgrim of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a> to <a href="../cathen/02428e.htm">Benedict VIII</a>, it is mentioned as part of the <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Diocese of Passau</a>. When in 973 the See of Prague was established, it included Moravia, Silesia (with Cracow), and the Lausitz. In 1048 Duke Bretislav Achilles founded the first Moravian <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, Raigern. The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> concept of a kingdom called for several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> under a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. Therefore, when Bretislav's successor, Vratislav II, coveted the royal crown, he created the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> conditions, and in 1063 Olm&uuml;tz became a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>. The emperor gained a new vassal, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> another suffragan. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, as an indemnity for the loss of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>, received twelve fiefs in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, and annually the sum of one hundred marks silver from the ducal treasury. The first Moravian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was John I (1063-85), a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Brevnow. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Sts. Peter and Paul received a chapter with a dean as its head. John had to suffer a great deal from Bishop Jaromir (Gebhard) of Prague, the unpriestly brother of Duke Vratislav. Jaromir personally attacked and maltreated Bishop John in the latter's episcopal palace. <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a> thereupon sent a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Rudolphus, who convoked a synod at Prague which Jaromir ignored. For this insubordination he was deposed. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> summoned both <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Synod of 1074 Jaromir expressed his regret for maltreating John, but declined to give up the fief of Bodovin, whereupon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> asked Vratislav to expel Jaromir, by force if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>.

<p>Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Olm&uuml;tz, during the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the following are prominent: Heinrich (called Zdik after his birthplace) transferred his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Wenceslaus, which had been twenty-four years in construction, and at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1138, took the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> habit in the church of the Holy Sepulchre at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Bishop Kaiim, in 1193, while ordaining <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, forgot the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">imposition of hands</a>. His successor, Engelbert, corrected this omission two years later; but the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal-Deacon</a> Petrus declared the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> null and void, and caused it to be repeated in its entirety in 1197. When the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> attempted to enforce a strict observance of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> relating to <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a>, he was expelled from the country; the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, however, were henceforth more strictly observed. During the time that <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a> was joined to <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, the Duke of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> appointed the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Olm&uuml;tz. In 1182 Moravia became independent, and thereafter the margraves of <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a> exercised the right of appointment. Premysl Ottokar I, in 1207, granted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Olm&uuml;tz freedom from taxes and to the chapter the right of electing the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> confirmed this grant. After the death of Ottokar II, Rudolph of Hapsburg appointed Bishop Bruno regent in <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>. Charles IV, in 1343, made Prague the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> for Leitomischl and Olm&uuml;tz. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, as a vassal principality of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> crown, was the peer of the margravate of <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>, and from 1365 its prince-bishop was Count of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> Chapel, i.e. first court <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> who was to accompany the monarch on his frequent travels. In 1380 the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the residence of the prince-bishop were both destroyed by fire. During this period the following orders were established: the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a> (Hradisch, Klosterbr&uuml;ck); <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> (Velehrad); the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> during the lives of their founders; the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a>. On the other hand there arose the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>, <a href="../cathen/06089c.htm">Flagellants</a>, <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldensians</a> (Apostolic Brethren, Brethren of the Holy Ghost), <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> (<a href="../cathen/02616a.htm">Bohemian Brethren</a>, Grubenheimer, Picardians). Thus it happened that <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> found a well-prepared field. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> was preached by Speratus at Iglau; Hubmaier and Huter were <a href="../cathen/02278a.htm">Baptists</a>. Exiled from <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a> came in droves into <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>; L&aelig;lius Socinus, on his homeward journey from <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> to <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, successfully sowed the seed of <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinianism</a>. Bishop Dubravsky (Dubravius), famous as an author and historian, encouraged the disheartened <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> (1553). The thirty-three volumes of his history of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, his five books on fish-raising (piscatology), and the work entitled "Ueber das heilige Messopfer" justify his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>.

<p>The Reform movement was finally arrested by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Three of them reached Olm&uuml;tz in 1566 and rapidly acquired influence and power. Bishop Prusinovsky granted them a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and turned over to them the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> as well as the projected <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. At a synod strict orders and regulations were adopted. His fourth successor, Pavlovsky, accomplished wonders in carrying out the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. Rudolph II conferred upon him the title of duke and prince and made him a member of the royal <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. The canons whom he gathered at Olm&uuml;tz were distinguished for learning and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The most important <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of this see during the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> period was Cardinal Franz Dietrichstein (d. 1636), son of Adam, major-domo of the imperial household. He governed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> for thirty-seven years, and accomplished extraordinary things both as statesman and ecclesiastic. His work, of course, met with considerable opposition. He was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at <a href="../cathen/03011c.htm">Br&uuml;nn</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of Olm&uuml;tz was abolished. <a href="../cathen/08484a.htm">Johannes Sarkander</a>, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Holleschau, became a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> for the secrecy of the confessional at Olm&uuml;tz, 17 March, 1620, and in 1860 he was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>. Better days soon appeared. The title of prince was conferred on both the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and his brother, whose descendants were to inherit the title. Amos Comenius (Komenzky), the last "senior" of the <a href="../cathen/02616a.htm">Bohemian Brethren</a>, fled to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. Pre-eminent as a pedagogue his influence was felt later on in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life of his country. Dietrichstein was succeeded by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm, son of Ferdinand II, and by Charles Joseph, son of Ferdinand III. In 1663 Charles Joseph was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a> and Olm&uuml;tz, with a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>, as he was scarcely fourteen years of age; but died the following year. In 1693 Charles, son of Duke Charles of Lorraine, at the age of twenty-three, became sub-deacon and exercised the administrative power in temporal affairs; four years later he obtained the spiritual administration. The dissolution of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in 1773 affected three hundred and sixty-eight professors in nine colleges of Moravia. In the same year <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> withdrew from the chapter the right of electing its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; it was restored, however, by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, in 1777, raised Olm&uuml;tz to the dignity of an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, and subordinated to it the newly-founded <a href="../cathen/03011c.htm">See of Br&uuml;nn</a>. The archdiocese was divided into eight archpresbyterates and fifty-two deaneries. When the toleration edict of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> appeared in 1781, whole districts forsook the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The inhabitants since the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a> had been <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in secret. The emperor therefore ordered those desirous of renouncing the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> to make known in person their intention to the Commission on Religion. When Emperor Joseph began the dissolution of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, there were in <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a> and Silesia two thousand <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in eighty-three houses. From the sale of this <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, the so-called "Religion Fund", many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were established, three in Olm&uuml;tz alone. In the rural parts the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were not to be more than four miles apart. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> received a stipend of four hundred florins, a local <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> three hundred florins, and an assistant two hundred florins. The third <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of Olm&uuml;tz was Archduke Rudolph, brother of Emperor Francis. Cardinal Maximilian Joseph, Freiherr von Somerau-Beckh, had, in 1848, as adviser and assistant, the brilliant chancellor Kutschker. On 2 December of the same year, in the throne room of the prince-archbishop's residence, Francis Joseph assumed the imperial sceptre. While the Austrian Parliament sat at Kremsier, Olm&uuml;tz was the political capital of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Eighty years old, Somerau-Beckh attended the great assembly of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1849. Here he proposed by legal enactment to abolish the rule requiring every member of the Olm&uuml;tz chapter to be of noble birth, because this rule was contrary to the spirit of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> to the untitled <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The Olm&uuml;tz chapter for a long time opposed this proposition both at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and at the imperial court, but without success. The two last prince-bishops have also been commoners. Cardinal F&uuml;rstenberg rebuilt in splendid <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> with its three towers, carefully preserving the individuality of the old church. The Concordat of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1448) provided that if any high dignitary of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> resigned or died while in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to fill the vacancy thus caused. This he did, when Archbishop Theodor Kohn resigned his office in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on account of his great age, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03011c.htm">Br&uuml;nn</a>, Francis Sal. Bauer was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>.

<p>At the present (1910) Moravia has two and one half million inhabitants of whom over ninety-five percent are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, less than three per cent <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and nearly two per cent Hebrews. In the Archdiocese of Olm&uuml;tz there are 1,785,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; 1,507 priests; 220 male and 1,547 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> inmates of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>. The episcopal city has a population of 22,000.
