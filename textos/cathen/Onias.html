<h1>Onias</h1>  

<p>(<em>&rsquo;On&#237;as</em>).

<p>Name of several Jewish <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">pontiffs</a> of the third and second centuries before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.
<h2>Onias I</h2>

<p>Son and successor of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> Jaddua, who, according to <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Antiq., XI, viii, 7) received Alexander the Great in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Succeeding his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> soon after the death of Alexander (Josephus, ibid.), he held office for twenty-three years (323-300 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>). In I Mach., xii, 7, he is said to have received a friendly letter from Arius, ruler of the Spartans. The letter is mentioned by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Antiq., XII, iv, 10), who gives its contents with certain modifications of the form in Machabees (xii, 20-23). During Onias's pontificate Palestine was the scene of continual conflicts between the forces of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, who several times alternated as masters of the country. During this period also, and because of unsettled conditions at home, many <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> left Palestine for the newly founded city of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>.
<h2>Onias II</h2>

<p>Son of Simon the Just. He is not mentioned in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, but <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> says (Antiq., XII, iv, 1-6) that, though a <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a>, he was a man "of little <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and a great lover of money." He refused to pay the customary tribute of twenty talents of silver to Ptolemy Euergetes, who then threatened to occupy the Jewish territory, a calamity which was averted by the tactful activity of Joseph, a nephew of Onias, who went to Ptolemy and purchased immunity from invasion.
<h2>Onias III</h2>

<p>Son and successor (198 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) of Simon II, and grandson of Onias II. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> attributes to him the correspondence with Arius of <a href="../cathen/14209b.htm">Sparta</a> (see above, O<font size=-2>NIAS</font> I). He is mentioned in II Mach., xv, 12, as a good and virtuous man, modest and gentle in his manner. During his pontificate Seleucus Philopator, King of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, sent his minister, Heliodorus, to Jerusalem with a view to obtain possession of the alleged treasures of the Temple (<a href="../bible/2ma003.htm">2 Maccabees 3</a>).
<h2>Onias (also called Menelaus)</h2>

<p>Mention is made in <a href="../bible/2ma004.htm">2 Maccabees 4</a> of Menelaus, brother of Simon, who became the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> accuser of Onias III, and later a venal usurper of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. According to <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, on the other hand, he originally bore the name Onias, changed for political reasons into one more characteristically Greek (Antiq., XII, v. 1).
<h2>Onias IV</h2>

<p>Son of Onias III, too young to succeed his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, which was usurped successively by Jason and Menelaus (see above) and later by <a href="../cathen/01273c.htm">Alcimus</a>. In the meantime Onias withdrew into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, where he obtained from Ptolemy Philometor a tract of land near Heliopolis, on which (about 160 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) he erected a sort of temple. Here a regular Temple worship was inaugurated in defiance of the Law, but the innovation was doubtless justified in the mind of Onias by the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> conditions at the home sanctuary, and by the great number of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> resident in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. The project was censured by the authorities in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> (Mishna, Menachoth xiii, 10) and it was blamed by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> (Bell. Jud., VII, x, 3). Nevertheless, the worship was maintained until after <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 70, when it was abolished by Lupus, prefect of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> (Josephus, "Bell. Jud.", VII, x, 4).
<h2>Onias (of Jerusalem)</h2>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in the days of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> Hyrcanus, i.e. about the middle of the first century <font size=-2>B.C.</font> (see Mishna, Thaanith iii, 8, and Josephus Antiq., XIV, ii, 1).
