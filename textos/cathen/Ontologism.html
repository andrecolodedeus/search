<h1>Ontologism</h1>  

<p>(from <em>on, ontos</em>, being, and <em>logos</em>, science)

<p>Ontologism is an ideological system which maintains that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Divine <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are the first object of our intelligence and the <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the first act of our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.
<h2>Exposition</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/09568a.htm">Malebranche</a> developed his theory of "la vision en Dieu" in different works, particularly "Recherche de la v&eacute;rit&eacute;", III, under the influence of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> and <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesian</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophies</a>, and of a misunderstanding of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine's</a> and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas's</a> principles on the origin and source of our <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. It is also in large part the consequence of his theory of occasional causes (see <a href="../cathen/11195b.htm">OCCASIONALISM</a>). Our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things, he says, is the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> we have of them in their <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of things are present to our mind, endowed with the essential characteristics of universality, necessity, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and are not the result of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> elaboration or representations of things as they are, but the archetypes which concrete and temporal things realize. Ideas have their source and real existence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; they are the Divine essence itself, considered as the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> model of all things. "God is the locus of our <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, as space is the locus of bodies." <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is then always really present to our mind; we see all things, even material and concrete things, in Him, Who contains and manifests to our intelligence their nature and existence. <a href="../cathen/06562b.htm">Vincenzo Gioberti</a> (1801-52) developed his Ontologism in "Introduzione allo studio della filosofia" (1840), I, iii; II, i. Our first act of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is the <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitive</a> judgment "ens creat existentias" (Being creates existences). By that act, he says, our mind apprehends directly and immediately in an <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitive</a> synthesis; <ul><li>being, not simply in general nor merely as ideal, but as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> and real, viz., <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <li>existences or contingent beings; <li>the relation which unites being and existences, viz., the creative act.</ul> In this judgment being is the subject, existences the predicate, the creative act the copula. Our first <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> perception is, therefore, an <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the first intelligible, as creating existences. This <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> is finite and is obtained by means of expressions or words (<em>la parola</em>). Thus the <em>primum philosophicum</em> includes both the <em>primum ontologicum</em> and the <em>primum psychologicum</em>, and the <em>ordo sciendi</em> is identified with the <em>ordo rerum</em>. This formula was accepted and defended by <a href="../cathen/03001a.htm">Orestes A. Brownson</a>. (Cf. Brownson's Works, <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, 1882; I, "The Existence of God", 267 sq.; "Schools of Philosophy, 296 sq.; "Primitive Elements of Thought", 418 sq. etc.)

<p>Ontologism was advocated, under a more moderate form, by some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the nineteenth century. Maintaining against <a href="../cathen/09568a.htm">Malebranche</a> that concrete material things are perceived by our senses, they asserted that our universal <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> endowed with the characteristics of necessity and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and our notion of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> cannot exist except in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and they cannot therefore be known except by an <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> present to our mind and perceived by our intelligence not in His essence as such, but in His essence as the archetype of all things. Such is the Ontologism taught by <a href="../cathen/15114a.htm">C. Ubaghs</a>, professor at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, in "Essai d'id&eacute;ologie ontologique" (Louvain, 1860); by Abb&eacute; L. Branchereau in "Pr&aelig;lectiones Philosophic&aelig;"; by Abb&eacute; F. Hugonin in "Ontologie ou &eacute;tudes des lois de la pens&eacute;e" (Paris, 1856-7); by Abb&eacute; J. Fabre in "D&eacute;fense de l'ontologisme"; by <a href="../cathen/15349a.htm">Carlo Vercellone</a>, etc. We find also the fundamental principles of Ontologism in <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini's</a> philosophy, although there have been many attempts to defend him against this accusation (cf. G. Morando, "Esame critico delle XL proposizione rosminiane condannate dalla S.R.U. inquisizione", Milan, 1905). According to <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a>, the form of all our thoughts is being in its ideality (<em>l'essere ideale</em>, <em>l'essere iniziale</em>). The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of being is innate in us and we perceive it by <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a>. Altogether indetermined, it is neither <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> nor creature; it is an appurtenance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is something of the Word ("Teosophia", I, n. 490; II, n. 848; cf. "Rosminianarum propositionum trutina theologica", Rome, 1892). At the origin and basis of every system of Ontologism, there are two principal reasons: <ol><li>we have an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> and this cannot be obtained through abstraction from finite beings, since it is not contained in them; it must, therefore, be innate in our mind and perceived through <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a>; <li>our concepts and fundamental judgments are endowed with the characteristics of universality, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and necessity, e.g., our concept of man is applicable to an indefinite number of individual men; our principle of identity "whatever is, is", is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> inn itself, necessarily and always.</ol> Now such concepts and judgments cannot be obtained from any consideration of finite things which are particular, contingent, and temporal. <a href="../cathen/06562b.htm">Gioberti</a> insists also on the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> being alone intelligible by Himself, we cannot have any <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of finite things independently of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to be truly scientific must follow the ontological, or real, order and therefore must begin with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the first being and source of all existing beings. Ontologists appeal to the authority of the Fathers, especially <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>.
<h2>Refutation</h2>

<p>From the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> point of view, the immediate <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of His Divine <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, as held by Ontologists, is above the natural power of man's intelligence. We are not conscious, even by reflection, of the <a href="../cathen/12396a.htm">presence of God</a> in our mind; and, if we did have such an <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> we would find in it (as <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> rightly remarks) the full satisfaction of all our aspirations, since we would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His essence (for the distinction between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His essence and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as containing the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of things, as advanced by Ontologists, is arbitrary and cannot be more than <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>); <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> or <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would be impossible. (Cf. St. Thom. in Lib. Boetii de Trinitate, Q. I, a. 3; de Veritate, Q. XVIII, a. 1.) Again, all our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> thoughts, even those concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are accompanied by sensuous images; they are made of elements which may be applied to creatures as well as to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself; only in our <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of His attributes, these elements are divested of the characteristics of imperfection and limit which they have in creatures, and assume the highest possible degree of perfection. In a word, our <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not direct and proper; it is analogical (cf. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">GOD</a>; <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">ANALOGY</a>). This shows that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not known by <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a>.

<p>The reasons advanced by Ontologists rest on confusion and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> assumptions. The <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> has an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>; but this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> may be and in fact is, obtained from the notion of the finite, by the successive processes of abstraction, elimination, and transcendence. The notion of the finite is the notion of being having a certain perfection in a limited degree. By eliminating the element of limitation and conceiving the positive perfection as realized in its highest possible degree, we arrive at the notion of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. We form in this way, a negativo-positive concept, as the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> say, of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> also that our <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> have the characteristics of necessity, universality, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; but these are essentially different from the <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">attributes of God</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a> necessarily, viz., He is absolutely, and cannot not exist; our <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in the sense that, when an object is conceived in its essence, independently of the concrete beings in which it is realized, it is a subject of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> relations: man, if he exists, is necessarily a rational being. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is absolutely universal in the sense that He eminently possesses the actual fulness of all perfections; our <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are universal in the sense that they are applicable to an indefinite number of concrete beings. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is eternal in the sense that He exists by Himself and always identical with Himself; our <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are eternal in the sense that in their state of abstraction they are not determined by any special place in space or moment in time.

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone is perfectly intelligible in Himself, since He alone has in Himself the reason of His existence; finite beings are intelligible in the very measure in which they exist. Having an existence distinct from that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they have also an intelligibility distinct from Him. And it is precisely because they are dependent in their existence that we conclude to the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, the first intelligible. The assumption that the order of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> must follow the order of things, holds of absolute and perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, not of all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. It is sufficient for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that it affirm as real that which is truly real; the order of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> may be different from the order of reality. The confusion of certain Ontologists regarding the notion of being opens the way to <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>. Neither <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> nor <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> favours Ontologism. It is through a misunderstanding of their theories and of their expression that the Ontologist appeals to them. (Cf. St. Augustine, <a href="../fathers/120110.htm"><em>City of God</em> X, XI</a>; "De utilitate credendi", lib. 83, cap. XVI, Q. xlv, etc.; St. Thomas, "Summa Theol.", I, Q. ii, a. 11; Q. lxxxiv-lxxxviii; "Qq. disp., de Veritate", Q. xvi, a. l; Q. xi, "De magistro", a. 3, etc.)
<h2>The condemnation of ontologism by the Church</h2>

<p>The Council of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1311-12) had already condemned the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Begards who maintained that we can see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by our natural intelligence. On 18 September, 1861, seven propositions of the Ontologists, concerning the immediate and the innate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being, and the relation of finite things to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, were declared by the Holy Office <em>tuto tradi non posse</em> (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, nn. 1659-65). The same congregation, in 1862, pronounced the same censure against fifteen propositions by Abb&eacute; Branchereau, subjected to its examination, two of which (xii and xiii) asserted the existence of an innate and direct perception of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, Cardinals Pecci and Sforza presented a <em>postulatum</em> for an explicit condemnation of Ontologism. On 14 December, 1887 the Holy Office reproved, condemned, and proscribed forty propositions extracted from the works of <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a>, in which the principles of Ontologism are contained (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, nn. 1891-1930).
