<h1>Oporto</h1>  

<p>(Portucalensis)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>; comprising 26 civil <em>concelhos</em> of the districts of Oporto and Aveiro; probably founded in the middle of the sixth century. At the third Council of Toledo (589) the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> usurper Argiovito was deposed in favour of Constancio the rightful <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In 610 Bishop Argeberto assisted at the Council at Toledo, summoned by King Gundemar to sanction the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> claims of Toledo. Bishop Ansiulfo was present at the Sixth Council of Toledo (638) and Bishop Flavio at the Tenth (656). Bishop Froarico attended the Third Council of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> (675) and the Twelfth, Thirteenth, and Fifteenth Councils of Toledo (681, 683, and 688), and his successor Felix appeared at the Sixteenth Council (693). No other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is recorded under the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> monarchy. After the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> invasion Justus seems to have been the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Gomado was probably elected in 872, when King Affonso III won back the city. The names of only four other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> have been preserved: Froarengo (906), Hermogio (912), Ordonho, and Diogo. Oporto fell again into <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> hands, and on its recovery, Hugo became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1114-1134-6). He secured exemption from the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a>. He greatly enlarged his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> patrimony increased by the donations he secured; thus, in 1120, he received from D. Theresa <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the City of Oporto with all the rents and dues thereof. John Peculiar was promoted to Braga (1138), his nephew, Pedro Rabaldis, succeeding at Oporto. Next came D. Pedro Pitoes (1145 to 1152 or 1155), D. Pedro Senior (d. 1172), and D. Fern&atilde;o Martins (d. 1185). Martinho Pires instituted a chapter, was promoted to <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a>, 1189 or 1190. Martinho Rodrigues ruled from 1191 to 1235. He quarrelled with the chapter over their share of the rents of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Later on, fresh disagreements arose in which King Sancho intervened against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who was deprived of his goods and had to flee, but was restored by the king when <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> espoused the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> cause. Another quarrel soon arouse between <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> and king, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>; but he escaped and fled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in 1209 the king, feeling the approach of death, made peace with him. His successor, Pedro Salvadores, figured prominently in the questions between the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and King Sancho II, who refused to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> the right of purchasing or inheriting land. <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> fell into <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>, in which the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy's</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> were violated and their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> outraged, though they themselves were not guiltless. Finally, <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Pope Innocent IV</a> committed the reform of abuses to Affonso, brother of Sancho, who lost his crown.

<p>Under Bishop Julian (1247-60) the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> difficulty became aggravated. A settlement was effected at the Cortes of Leiria (1254), which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> refused to ratify, but he had to give way. When King Affonso III determined (1265) that all <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and properties usurped during the disorders of Sancho's reign should revert to the Crown, nearly all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, including the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Oporto, then D. Vicente, protested; and seven went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for relief, leaving <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> under an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>. When the king was dying, in 1278, he promised restitution. Vicente (d. 1296) was one of the negotiators of the Concordat of 1289 and the supplementary Accord of Eleven Articles. He was succeeded by Sancho Pires, who ruled until 1300. Geraldo Domingues resigned in 1308 to act as counsellor of the King's daughter Constanca, future Queen of Castile. Tredulo was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for two and a half years. The <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorite</a> Frei Estevan was succeeded in 1313 by his nephew Fernando Ramires. Both uncle and nephew quarrelled with King Denis and left the realm.

<p>Owing to the hostility of the citizens, Bishop Gomes lived mostly outside his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. When Pedro Affonso became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1343, he had a quarrel over <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and, like his predecessor, departed, leaving the diocese under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>. Six years later he returned, but again the monarch began to encroach, and it was not until 1354 that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> secured recognition of his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. His successor was Affonso Pires. Egidio is probably the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> represented in the old Chronicles as being threatened with scourging by King Pedro for having lived in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with a citizen's wife The accusation was probably groundless, but Egidio left the city, which for twelve years had no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In 1373 or 1375 John succeeded and supported the lawful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in the Great Schism, and the Master of Aviz against Spanish claims.

<p>Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: John de Zambuja, or Estevans; and Gil, who in 1406 sold the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over Oporto to the Crown for an annual money payment, reduced in the reign of D. Manuel to 120 silver marks; Fernando Guerra, who in 1425 was created <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a>; Vasco. &mdash; Ant&atilde;o Martins de Chavis, who succeeded Vasco in 1430, was sent by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to Constantinople to induce the Greek emperor to attend the Council of Basle. He succeeded, and as a reward was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. He died in 1447. Succeeding incumbents were: Durando; Gon&ccedil;alves de Obidos; Luis Pires (1454-64), a negotiator of the Concordat of 1455 and a reforming <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>; John de Azevedo (1465-1494), a benefactor of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and chapter, as was his successor Diego de Sousa, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> and executor of King Manuel. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was then held by two brothers in succession, Diego da Costa (1505-7) and D. Pedro da Costa (1511-39), who restored the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> palace and enriched the capitular revenues from his own purse; Belchior Beliago; and the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Frei Balthazar Limpo (1538-52), the fiftieth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He held a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod in 1540.

<p>In the time of Rodrigo Pinheiro, a learned <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a>, Oporto was visited by <a href="../cathen/06213a.htm">St. Francis Borgia</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> established themselves in the city. Ayres da Sylva, ex-rector of Coimbra University, after ruling four years, fell in the battle of Alcacer in 1578 with King Sebastian. Sim&atilde;o Pereyra was followed by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Frei Marcos de Lisboa, chronicler of his order. He added to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and convoked a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod in 1585. In 1591 another ex-rector of Coimbra, Heironymo de Menezes, became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; he was succeeded by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Frei Goncalo de Moraes, a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> defender of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He built a new <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> and <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In 1618 Bishop Rodrigo da Cunha, author of the history of the Bishops of Oporto, was appointed. His "Catalogo" describes the state of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and enumerates the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> with their population and income in 1623 and is the earliest account we possess. His successor was Frei John de Valladares, transferred from the See of Miranda. Gaspar do Rego da Fonseca, who held the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> four years (1635-39). King Philip III named Francisco Pereira Pinto, but the revolution in 1640 prevented his taking possession, so that the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was considered vacant until 1671, being ruled by administrators appointed by the chapter. In 1641 John IV chose D. Sebasti&atilde;o Cesar de Menezes as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, influenced by <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, would neither recognize the new King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> nor confirm his nominations. Next came Frei Pedro de Menezes; Nicolau Monteiro took possession in 1671, Fernando Correia de Lacerda, in 1673, who was succeeded by Jo&atilde;o de Sousa. Frei Jos&eacute; Saldanha (1697-1708), famed for his austerity, never relinquished his <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> habit, a contrast to his successor Thomas de Almeida, who in 1716 became the first <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>. The see remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> until 1739, and, though Frei John Maria was then elected, he never obtained confirmation. In the same year Frei Jos&eacute; Maria da Fonseca, formerly Commissary General of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Several <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> States selected him as arbiter of their differences. He contributed to the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of a number of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. He founded and restored many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>.

<p>Next in order were: Frei Antonio de Tavora (d. 1766), Frei Aleixo de Miranda Henriques, Frei John Raphael de Mendon&ccedil;a (1771-3), and Louren&ccedil;o Correia de S&aacute; Benevides (1796-8). Frei Antonio de Castro became <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> in 1814, being followed at Oporto by John Avellar. Frei Manuel de Santa Ignez, though elected, never obtained confirmation, but some years after his death, relations between <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> were re-established by a concordat and Jeronymo da Costa Rebello became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1843. From 1854 to 1859 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was held by Antonio da Fonseca Moniz; on his death it remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> until 1862, when John de Castro e Moura, who had been a missionary in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, was appointed (d.1868). The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was again vacant until the confirmation of Americo Ferreira dos Santos Silva in 1871. This <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to combat the growing <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> of his flock and the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> propaganda in Oporto A popular lawyer named Mesquita started a campaign against him, because the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> refused to dismiss some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, reputed reactionary, who served the Aguardente Chapel; getting himself elected judge of the Brotherhood of the Temple, he provoked a great platform agitation with the result that the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was secularized and became a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> under the patronage of the Marquis of Pombal Association. In 1879 Americo was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and on his death the present (1911) Bishop, Antonio Barroso, an ex-missionary, was transferred from the See of Mylapore to that of Oporto.

<p>The Diocese of Oporto is suffragan to Braga. It has 479 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 1120 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 650,000, and 500 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>.
