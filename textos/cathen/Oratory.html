<h1>Oratory</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>oratorium</em>, from <em>orare</em>, to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>)

<p>As a general term, Oratory signifies a place of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, but technically it means a structure other than a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, set aside by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the celebration of Mass. Oratories seem to have originated from the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> erected over the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the early <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> where the faithful resorted to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and also from the necessity of having a place of worship for the people in country districts when churches proper were restricted to <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> cities. We also find early mention of private oratories for the celebration of Mass by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and later of oratories attached to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and to the residences of nobles. In the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> organization is neither so complete nor so rigid as in the West, private oratories were so numerous as to constitute an abuse. In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> oratories are classed as (1) public, (2) semipublic, and (3) private.
<h2 id="section1">Public oratories</h2>

<p>Are canonically erected by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and are perpetually dedicated to the Divine service. They must have an entrance and exit from the public road, Priests who celebrate <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in public oratories must conform to the office proper to those oratories, whether secular or regular. If, however, the calendar of an oratory permits a votive Mass to be said, the visiting <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may celebrate in conformity with his own <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> or regular calendar.
<h2 id="section2">Semipublic oratories</h2>

<p>Are those which, though erected in a private building, are destined for the use of a community. Such are the oratories of <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> congregations, colleges, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>, and such institutions. If, however, there be several oratories in one house, it is only the one in which the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is preserved that has the privileges of a semipublic oratory. All semipublic oratories (which class technically includes the private <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>) are on the same footing as public oratories in regard to the celebration of Mass. The calendar of feasts to be observed in them (unless they belong to a regular order having its proper calendar) is that of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In oratories belonging to <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, the feasts of their community are to be celebrated in accordance with the decrees or <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a> they have received from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Regulars visiting a semipublic oratory cannot celebrate the feasts of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of their own order unless the calendar proper to the oratory prescribes the same or permits of a votive Mass. Public and semipublic oratories are ordinarily under the control of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The Congregation of Rites declared (23 Jan., 1899): "In these (oratories), as, by the authority of the ordinary, the holy <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the Mass</a> can be offered, so also all those present thereat can satisfy thereby the precept which obliges the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to hear Mass on prescribed days." The same <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> also gives an authoritative definition of the three species of oratories.
<h2 id="section3">Private oratories</h2>

<p>Are those erected in private houses for the convenience of some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> or <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> by an <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. They can be erected only by permission of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Oratories in private houses date from Apostolic times when the Sacred Mysteries could not be publicly celebrated owing to the persecutions. Even after the peace of Constantine, the custom continued to prevail. Kings and nobles especially had such oratories erected in their palaces. As early as the reign of Emperor Justinian, we find regulations concerning private oratories as distinguished from public churches, and prohibitions against saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in private houses (Novel., lviii and cxxxi). Permissions to celebrate were granted, however, freely in the West by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and councils. The latest <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> regulating private oratories is that of the Sacred Congregation of the Discipline of the Sacraments of 7 Feb., 1909. According to this, private oratories are conceded by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> only on account of bodily infirmity, or difficulty of access to a public church or as a reward for services done to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> or to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause. The grant of a private oratory may be temporary or for the life of the grantee, according to the nature of the cause that is adduced. In either case, the simple concession of an oratory implies that only one Mass a day may be celebrated, that the precept of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> concerning the hearing of Mass on prescribed days (certain special festivals generally specified in the <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> excluded) may be there satisfied only by the grantees, and that the determination of the place, city, and diocese where the oratory is to be erected is approved. The <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> will be forwarded to the ordinary. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> then recites the various extensions of the before-mentioned privileges that may be conceded to grantees:
<h3 id="A">As to the satisfaction of the precept of hearing Mass</h3>

<p>This is usually conceded by the <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> only to the following: relatives of the grantee living under the same roof, dependants of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and guests or those who share his table. The others living in the house may not satisfy the precept except it be a funeral Mass or on account of the distance of the public church. If the oratory be a rural one, those employed on the estate may there hear Mass, but in that case the grantee must provide for a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction and an explanation of the Gospel. The same holds for a private oratory in a camp or castle or a widespread domain. In very peculiar circumstances (to be judged by the ordinary) all others may also hear Mass in a private oratory while the conditions prevail.
<h3 id="B">As to hearing Mass in the absence of the grantees</h3>

<p>This is allowed in the presence of one of the relatives living under the same roof, but the concession is to be understood of a temporary absence of the grantees and that the relative be expressly determined. The same is extended to the principal one among the familiars, rural servants, or dependants.
<h3 id="C">As to the number of Masses</h3>

<p>If the grantees are two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who are brothers, both may celebrate <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. A thanksgiving Mass is also allowed if the ordinary recommends it. Priests who are guests may say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in the oratory of the house where they are staying if they have commendatory letters from the ordinary, provided they are infirm or the church is distant. Several Masses may also be said during the last agony or at the death or anniversary of one of the grantees and likewise on the feast of his <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a>.
<h3 id="D">As to greater festivals</h3>

<p>By an extension of privileges, Mass may be allowed in private oratories on all days except on the feast of the local patron, the Assumption, <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. Sometimes the concession may extend to the first three feasts, but very rarely to <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and then only on the urgent recommendation of the ordinary, exception being made for grantees who are infirm <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.
<h3 id="E">As to concessions</h3>

<p>Sometimes a grantee may have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of a private oratory in two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, but then both ordinaries must give testimonial letters. In case the oratory is situated in a place where the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> has to say two Masses on the same day, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> from some other place may say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in the oratory but he may not say another Mass in addition. An oratory near a sick-room is also allowed occasionally during sickness. This <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> likewise allows ordinaries (for ten cases only) to grant a private oratory to poor <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who are aged and infirm. It will be noted that this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a> is a very liberal extension of the provisions formerly governing private oratories.
