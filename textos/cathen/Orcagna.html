<h1>Orcagna</h1>  

<p>(The conventional name in art history of A<font size=-2>NDREA DI</font> C<font size=-2>IONE</font>, also called A<font size=-2>RCAGNUOLO</font> or A<font size=-2>RCANGIO</font>).

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, early in the fourteenth century; died there, 1368. The son of a goldsmith, he became architect, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a>, mosaist, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, and poet.

<p>His brothers, <a href="../cathen/10703c.htm">Nard&ograve;</a>, Jacopo, and Matteo, were also architects, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptors</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>: Nard&ograve;, the eldest, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the famous fresco of "The Last Judgment", still to be seen in the Strozzi <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in S. Maria Novella, a composition inspired by the "Divina Commedia" and comprising the Judgment, <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a>, and Hell as its three parts. This fresco has been <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> attributed to Andrea, who became the most famous of the Cioni, but <a href="../cathen/06544a.htm">Lorenzo Ghiberti</a> testifies to its being the work of <a href="../cathen/10703c.htm">Nard&ograve;</a>. In the same way, the "Triumph of Death" and the "Last Judgment" in the Campo Santo of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, owing to their similarity to the S. Maria Novella fresco, used to be attributed to Nard&ograve; and Andrea di Cione. Both these brothers were registered in the Florentine Guild of Painters in 1357. In that year Andrea (Orcagna) collaborated with Francesco di Talento on plans for the enlargement of S. Maria del Fiore. In 1358 he executed the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>. <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a> makes <a href="../cathen/01470a.htm">Andrea Pisano</a> his master in the art of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, but this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is more probably due to Neri di Fieravante, his sponsor when he matriculated in the Guild of "masters of stone and wood", in 1352. According to <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a>, the Brotherhood of Orsammichele took the offerings made to the Blessed Virgin during the plague of 1348 and used them to build around her image an elaborately ornamented marble tabernacle. Orcagna was entrusted with this work, which he completed in 1359. For brilliancy and richness of architecture as well as of decoration, Burckhardt regards this tabernacle as the most perfect work of its kind in Italian Gothic. The mysteries of the life of the Blessed Virgin are represented in <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-relief</a> with a series of allegorical figures of the Virtues. The Announcement of Mary's Death and the Assumption are especially worthy of note. This tabernacle of Orsammichele is Orcagna's only authentic sculptural work, but his manner is discernible in the "Annunciation" of Santa Croce and in the <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-reliefs</a> of the Campanile of S. Maria del Fiore which represent the Virtues and Liberal Arts. The chief <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of Orcagna which have survived are: a St. Matthew, <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a>, in collaboration with his brother Jacopo, for S. Maria Novella, now in the Uffizi; a "Virgin with Angels", in the Somz&eacute;e collection at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>; a "Vision of St. Bernard", in the Academy of Florence; a "Coronation of the Virgin", executed for San Pier Maggiore, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, now in the National Gallery, London. In 1357 Tommaso di Rossello Strozzi commissioned Orcagna to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> an <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-piece</a> for the same <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in which Nard&ograve; had <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the frescoes. This re-table is divided into five parts: in the centre <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a>, a pyramidal crown on his brow, two little <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> at his feet, playing music; at <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> right hand is the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, presenting <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> to Him; at His left hand is the <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">Precursor</a> who indicates <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to a kneeling St. Peter. In the last two compartments are seen, on one side <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, on the other <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael</a> and St. Catherine. Orcagna was commissioned in the following year to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> the life of the Blessed Virgin on the walls of the choir of S. Maria Novella. These <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> were ruined by damp, owing to a leaking roof, but were restored by <a href="../cathen/06545a.htm">Ghirlandajo</a> who drew his inspiration from the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> "inventions of Orcagna" (Vasari).
