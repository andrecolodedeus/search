<h1>Ordeals</h1>  

<p>(<em>Iudicium Dei</em>; Anglo-Saxon, <em>ord&acirc;l</em>; <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German</a> <em>Urteil</em>).

<p>Ordeals were a means of obtaining evidence by trials, through which, by the direct interposition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the guilt or innocence of an accused <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> was firmly established, in the event that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> could not be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by ordinary means. These trials owed their existence to the firm <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that an omniscient and just <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would not permit an innocent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to be regarded as guilty and punished in consequence, but that He would intervene, by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, to proclaim the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The ordeals were either imposed by the presiding judge, or chosen by the contesting parties themselves. It was expected that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, approving the act imposed or permitted by an authorized judge, would give a distinct manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to reveal the guilt or innocence of the accused. It was believed from these premises that an equitable judgment must surely result.

<p>Ordeals are of two kinds: those undergone only by the accused, and those taken part in by both parties to the action. It was the common opinion that the decision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was made known in the result of the test, either immediately or after a short time. Ordeals were resorted to when the contesting parties were unable to bring forward further evidence, for according to the ancient German law, the production of evidence was not arranged for by the court itself, but was left to the contestants.

<p>Ordeals were known and practised by various peoples of antiquity, and are still to be met with today among uncivilized tribes. The Code of <a href="../cathen/07125a.htm">Hammurabi</a> prescribes their use for the ancient Babylonians. The <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> accused of a certain crime was subjected to the test of cold water, which consisted in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> plunging into a river; if the river bore him away his guilt was established; if he remained quiet and uninjured in the water, his innocence was believed to have been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> (Winkler, "Die Gesetze Hammurabis", Leipzig, 1902, 10). Among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> existed the test of the Water of Jealousy, conducted by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, in which the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> accused of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> must consume the draught in their presence, after having offered certain <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and the effects of which established the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> guilt or innocence (<a href="../bible/num005.htm#vrs12">Numbers 5:12-31</a>). Among the Indians are to be found likewise various kinds of ordeals, particularly that of the red-hot iron. This test of holding a red-hot iron was also known among the Greeks. The Romans, however, with their highly developed system of dispensing <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, did not employ this means of obtaining <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. Ordeals found their chief development among the Germanic peoples, in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> itself as well as in those kingdoms which came into existence, after the migration of the nations, in the old Roman Provinces of Gaul, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and Britain. They were an essential part of the judicial system of the Germanic races in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> times, were preserved and developed after the conversion of these peoples to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, became widespread and were in constant use.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missionaries did not in general combat this practice. They opposed only the <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duel</a>, and endeavoured to minimize the barbarity attendant upon the practice of ordeals. By <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and religious ceremonies, by the hearing of <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">holy Mass</a> and the reception of holy communion before the ordeal, the missionaries sought to give to it a distinctly <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and ceremonies are to be found in Franz, "Die kirchlichen Benediktionen im Mittelalter" (Freiburg im Br., 1909), II, 364 sqq.; the celebration of Mass on the occasion of the ordeal, in Franz, "Die Messe in deutschen Mittelalter" (Freiburg im Br., 1902), 213 sqq. This attitude of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in regard to ordeals may be explained if one takes into consideration the religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the times, as well as the close connection which existed between ordeals and the Germanic judicial system.

<p>The principal means of testing the accuser as well as the accused in the Germanic judicial practice was the Oath of the Co-jurors. It being often difficult to find jurors who were properly qualified, <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> frequently resulted, and the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> could be rejected by the opposing party. In such cases, the ordeal was brought forward as a substitute in determining the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the guilt, or the innocence. This mode of procedure was tolerated by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Germanic countries in the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. A thoroughgoing opposition to ordeals would have had little prospect of success. The only <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to take measures against the practice of ordeals during the conversion to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> of the Germanic races was <a href="../cathen/02161c.htm">St. Avitus</a> of Vienne (d. about 518). Later, Agobard of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> (d. 840) attacked the judicial <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duel</a> and other ordeals in two writings ("Liber adversus legem Grundobadi and Liber contra iudicium Dei", in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CIV, 125 sqq., 254 sqq.). On the other hand, shortly afterwards, <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Archbishop Hincmar of Reims</a>, at the time of the matrimonial disagreement between King Lothair and Theutberga, declared himself to be of the opinion that ordeals were permissible, the support of which he must assuredly have brought forward noteworthy arguments ("De divortio Lotharii regis et Tetbergae", in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CXXV, 659-80; cf. also <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar's</a> "Epistola ad Hildegarium episcopum", ibid., 161 sqq.). The universal opinion among the peoples of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom favoured the authorization of ordeals, and the same may be said of Britain. In 809 in the Capitulary of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> declared: "that all should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the ordeal without the shadow of a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>" (Mon. Germ. Hist., Capitularia, I, 150). In the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a> also, we encounter in the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the practice of ordeals, introduced from the countries of the West.



<p>The ordeals, strictly speaking, of the Germanic countries are the following: <ol> <li><a href="../cathen/05184b.htm"><em>The duel</em></a>, called <em>judicium Dei</em> in the Book of Laws of the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> King Gundobad (c. 500). (Mon. Germ. Hist., Leges, III, 537.) The outcome of the judicial <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duel</a> was looked upon as the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Only freemen were qualified to take part, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were permitted to appoint substitutes. The <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duel</a> originated in the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> times of the Germanic peoples. In certain individual nations were to be found various usages and regulations regarding the manner in which the <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duel</a> was to be conducted. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> combatted the judicial <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duel</a>; <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> declared it to be an infringement of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">law of God</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ("Epist. ad Carolum Calvum", in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CXIX, 1144), and several later <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> spoke against it. Ecclesiastics were forbidden to take part in a <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duel</a> either personally or through a substitute. Only English books of ritual of the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> contain a formula for the blessing of the shield and the sword for use in the judicial <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duel</a>; otherwise, no <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Ritual contains <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for these ordeals, a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that they were not looked upon favourably by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <li><em>The cross</em>, in which both parties, the accuser and the accused, stood before a cross with arms outstretched in the form of a cross. Whoever first let fall his arms was defeated. The earliest information we possess regarding this form of ordeal dates from the eighth century. It was destined to replace the <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duel</a>, and was prescribed by various capitularies of the ninth century, especially for disputes with <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>. <li><em>The hot iron</em>, employed in various ways, not only in courts of law, where the accused in ancient times to prove his innocence must pass through fire or place his hand in the flames, but also to prove the authenticity of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, and to reveal the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in other ways. The judicial test by fire, as an ordeal, was ordinarily conducted in the following manner: the accused must walk a certain distance (nine feet, among the Anglo-Saxons) bearing a bar of red-hot iron in his hands, or he must pass barefooted over red-hot ploughshares (usually nine). If he remained uninjured, his innocence was considered established. <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Rituals of various <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> contain <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and ceremonies for use before the undergoing of the test. The accused was also <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to prepare himself beforehand by confession and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. <li><em>Hot water</em>, or the cauldron. The accused must draw a stone with his naked arm from the bottom of a vessel filled with hot water, after which the arm was bound up and the bandage sealed; three days later it was removed, and, according to the condition of his arm, the accused was considered innocent or guilty. The religious ceremonies for this ordeal were similar to those used for the ordeal of the hot iron. <li><em>Cold water</em>, in use at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> among the Germanic races, and which continued to be practised notwithstanding the prohibition of the Emperor Louis the Pious in 829. The accused, with hands and feet bound, was cast into the water; if he sank, he was considered guilty; if however he floated upon the water, his innocence was believed to be established. For this test also, the accused prepared himself by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, confession, and communion, and by assisting at Mass. <li><em>The blessed morsel</em> (<em>iudicium offoe</em>, Anglo-Saxon <em>corsnaed, nedbread</em>), which consisted in the consuming by the accused of a piece of bread and a piece of cheese in the church before the altar, the morsels being blessed with special <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. If he was able to swallow them, his innocence was established, but if not, he was considered guilty. This test was in use principally among the Anglo-saxons. It is not mentioned in the ancient Germanic codes of the Continent. <li><em>The suspended loaf</em>. &#151; A loaf of bread was baked by a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> from meal and blessed water, through which a stick of wood was passed. The suspected <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> then appeared with two witness, between whom the bread was suspended, which, if it turned in a circle, was supposed to be a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of guilt. <li><em>The <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a></em>, which consisted in clamping into the Book of Psalms a stick of wood with a knob attached, and then placing the whole in an opening made in another piece of wood, so that the book could turn. The guilt of the accused was established if the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> turned from west to east, and his innocence, if it turned in a contrary direction. <li><em>The Examen in mensuris</em>. &#151; Though forms of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in connection with its use have been handed down to us, they do not give us a clear <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of how this test was conducted. It would seem to have been practised but seldom. It appears to have been an ordeal decided by lot, or by the measuring of the accused by a stick of a determined length. <li><em>Bleeding</em>, to discover a murderer. The <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> suspected of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> was forced to look upon the body or the wounds of the victim. If the wounds then began to bleed afresh, the guilt was supposed to have been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. </ol> In addition to these forms of genuine ordeals, two other kinds are frequently considered, which, however, do not exactly correspond to the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as in their case there is no question of a direct establishment of a fact by the interposition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The first of these is the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, which is but a means of establishing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, accompanied by a solemn calling upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but which is not in any sense a judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Another example is furnished by the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that the <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjured</a> would, sooner or later, be overtaken by death, which was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> punishment for <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, but this was not a judicial ordeal. The same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the Eucharistic test. The firm <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> existed that if anyone to prove his innocence should receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, he would, if guilty, be punished by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with instant death. Here also it is question of Divine chastisement; the judgment however not taking place by means of a judicial process. When at the Synod of Worms in 868 it was ordered that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should clear themselves of suspicion by the celebration of Mass, and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> by the reception of <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, this was in reality of the same significance as the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of purgation, by which those under shadow of suspicion <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to their innocence.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> and Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, as we have remarked above, were very broad-minded in their acceptation of the greater number of species of ordeals; several councils publishing regulations concerning them [cf. Hefele, "Konziliengeschichte," 2 ed., III, 611, 614, 623, 690, 732; IV, 555; Synod of Tribur (895), IV, 672; Synod of Seligenstadt (1022)]. Ordeals were practised in Britain, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in connection with legal processes before civil as well as <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunals up to and during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. From then on they were gradually discontinued.

<p>The tribunals of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> never made use of ordeals. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> were always opposed to them and began, at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, to take measures for their suppression. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that in the beginning no general <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was published regarding them; however, in individual cases concerning ordeals brought to them, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> always pronounced against the practice, and designated it as unlawful. This course was followed by <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> when, in 867, he prohibited the <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duel</a> by which King Lothair sought to decide his matrimonial dispute with Theutberga. The latter had previously, through one of her servants, submitted to the test of hot water to prove her innocence, and indeed with favourable results. Upon the inquiry of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> as to whether or not the tests of the hot water and the glowing iron could lawfully be made use of in the case of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> who were accused of having smothered their sleeping child, <a href="../cathen/14289c.htm">Stephen V</a> (885-891) forbade these ordeals (Decr. C. 20, C. II, qu. 5). <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a> (1061-73) likewise condemned these tests, and <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (1159-81) prohibited the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the Diocese of Upsala from countenancing a <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duel</a> or other ordeal imposed by law, as such a practice was disapproved of by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Before long definite condemnations were published by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, as for example, that of <a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Celestine III</a> (1191-98) regarding the <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duel</a>. At the Council of the Lateran in 1215, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> a general <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> against ordeals, which prohibited anyone from receiving the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> before submitting to the test of the hot water or to that of the glowing iron, and confirming the validity of the previous prohibition against the <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duel</a> (Can. xviii; in Hefele, l.c., V, 687).

<p>Various accounts in regard to the co-operation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in the practice of ordeals in <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> times which are contained in <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> writings have no historic value. From the twelfth century, a thorough and widespread opposition to ordeals, as a result of the stand taken by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, began to manifest itself generally, and whereas, at an earlier date, no one was found to support Agobard of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in his opposition to these tests, which was without result, the writings of Peter Cantor (d. 1197) against the proceedings of the civil courts with regard to ordeals (in his "Verbum abbreviatum", <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CCV, 226 sqq.) had a far greater success. In "Tristan", Gottfried of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> sets forth his disapproval of ordeals.

<p>As a result of the General Council of 1215, several <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries published prohibitions in this connection. A <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at Valladolid in 1322 declares in Can. xxvii: "The tests of fire and water are forbidden; whoever participates in them is <em>ipso facto</em> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>" (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, "Konziliengesch.", VI, 616). The <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a> also prohibited the <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duel</a> and other ordeals in the Constitution of Melfi, 1231 (Michael, "Geschichte des deutshen Volkes", I, 318). Nevertheless, there are to be found in Germanic code books as late as the thirteenth century, regulations for their use. However, a clearer recognition of the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> ground for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in ordeals, a more highly-developed judicial system, the fact that the innocent must be victims of the ordeal, the prohibitions of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, the refusal of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> to cooperate in the carrying out of the sentence &#151; all these causes worked together to bring about, during the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the gradual discontinuance of the practice. The ancient test of the cold water was resuscitated in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in the ducking of so-called <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witches</a>, consequent upon the trials for <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witchcraft</a>.
