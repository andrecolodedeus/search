<h1>Order of Aviz</h1>  

<p>A military body of Portuguese <a href="../cathen/01695a.htm">knights</a>.

<p>The Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, founded in 1128, was not only contemporaneous with the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> but conducted one of its own against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>. Some <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> were bound only by temporary <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and when these expired they would sometimes return to their country although the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was not ended. This accounts for the favour with which <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a> were regarded beyond the Pyrenees, in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> as well as in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; for in them the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of fighting against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">infidels</a> was perpetual, like other <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Knights Templar</a> were found in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> as early as 1128, and received a grant from Queen Teresa in the year of the Council of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, which confirmed their early <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>. A native order of this kind sprang up in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> about 1146. Affonso, the first king gave to it the town of <a href="../cathen/05670a.htm">Evora</a>, captured from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> in 1211, and the Knights were first called "Brothers of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> of <a href="../cathen/05670a.htm">Evora</a>". Pedro Henriquez, an <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> son of the king's father, was the first grand master. After the conquest of Aviz the military castle erected there became the motherhouse of the order, and they were then called "Knights of St. Benedict of Aviz", since they adopted the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Benedictine rule</a> in 1162, as modified by John Ziritu, one of the earliest <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. Like the Knights of Calatrava in Castile, the Knights of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> were indebted to the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> for their rule and their habit &#151; a white mantle with a green fleur-de-lysed cross. The Knights of Calatrava also surrendered some of their places in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> to them on condition that the Knights of Aviz should be subject to the visitation of their grand master. Hence the Knights of Aviz were sometimes regarded as a branch of the Calatravan Order, although they never ceased to have a Portuguese grand master, dependent for temporalities on the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> king. At the accession of King Ferdinand (1383) <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> broke out between Castile and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. When Jo&atilde;o I, who had been grand master of the Knights of Aviz, ascended the throne of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, he forbade the <a href="../cathen/01695a.htm">knights</a> to submit to <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> authority, and consequently, when Gonsalvo de Guzman came to Aviz as Visitor, the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, while according him hospitality, refused to recognise him as a superior. Guzman protested, and the point remained a subject of contention until the Council of Basle (1431), when <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> was declared to be in the wrong. But the right of the Calatravans was never exercised, and the next grand master of the Knights of Aviz, Rodrigo of Sequirol, continued to assert supreme authority over them.

<p>The mission of the <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a> in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> seemed to fail after the overthrow of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> domination, but the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> expeditions across the sea opened up a new field for them. The first landings of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, the conquest of Ceuta by King Jo&atilde;o I (1415), the attacks upon Tangier under Jo&atilde;o's son Duarte (1437) were also <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a>, inspired by a religious spirit and sanctioned by similar <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a>. The Knights of Aviz and the Knights of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, scions of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Knights Templars</a>, achieved deeds of valour, the former under the Infants Fernando, the latter under Henrique, brother of King Duarte. Fernando displayed a no less heroic forbearance during his six years of captivity among the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>, a long <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> which after his death placed him among the Blessed (Acta SS., 5 June). This splendid enthusiasm did not last. Soon the whole nation became affected by the wealth that poured in, and the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> in Africa degenerated into mere mercantile enterprise; the pontifical <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> were made a vulgar means of raising money and after the grand mastership of the order (1551) had been vested in the king in perpetuity, he availed himself of its income to reward any kind of service in the army or the fleet. If the wealth of the Knights of Aviz was not as great as that of the Knights of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it was still quite large, drawn as it was from some forty-three commanderies. The religous spirit of the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> vanished, and they withdrew from their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> brothers who continued alone the conventual life. They were dispensed from their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> by <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> (1402), who tolerated their marriage to prevent <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a>; <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a> (1551) allowed them to dispose freely of their personal properties. Nobility of birth remained the chief requirement of aspirants to the mantle, a requirement confirmed by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 1604. Queen Maria I, supported by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pope Pius VI</a> (1 Aug., 1789), attempted a last reformation and failed. Finally, the <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a> were suppressed by Dom Pedro, after the downfall of the Miguelist usurpation (1834).
