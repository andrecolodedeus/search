<h1>Order of Preachers</h1>  

<p>As the Order of the Friars Preachers is the principal part of the entire Order of St. Dominic, we shall include under this title the two other parts of the order: the Dominican Sisters (Second Order) and the Brothers of Penitence of St. Dominic (Third Order). First, we shall study the legislation of the three divisions of the order, and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of each. Secondly, we shall give an historical survey of the three branches of the order.
<h2 id="section1">Legislation and nature</h2>

<p>In its formation and development, the Dominican legislation as a whole is closely bound up with historical facts relative to the origin and progress of the order. Hence some reference to these is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, the more so as this matter has not been sufficiently studied. For each of the three groups, constituting the ensemble of the Order of St. Dominic, we shall examine: A. Formation of the Legislative Texts; B. Nature of the Order, resulting from legislation.
<h3 id="A">Formation of the legislative texts</h3>

<p>In regard to their legislation the first two orders are closely connected, and must be treated together. The preaching of <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> and his first companions in Languedoc led up to the pontifical letters of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, 17 Nov., 1205 (Potthast, "Reg., Pont., Rom.", 2912). They created for the first time in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the type of apostolic preachers, patterned upon the teaching of the Gospel. In the same year, Dominic founded the Monastery of Prouille, in the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> whom he had converted from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and he, made this establishment the centre of union of his missions and of his apostolic works (Balme-Lelaidier, "Cartulaire ou Histoire Diplomatique de St. Dominic", Paris, 1893, I, 130sq.; Guiraud, "Cart. de Notre Dame de Prouille," <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1907, I, CCCXX sq). St. Dominic gave to the new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a> and also the special Institutions which regulated the life of the Sisters, and of the Brothers who lived near them, for the spiritual and temporal administration of the community. The Institutions are edited in Balme, "Cart." II, 425; "Bull. Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", VII, 410; Duellius, "Misc.", bk. I (Augsburg, 1723), 169; "Urkundenbuch der Stadt.", I (Fribourg, Leipzig, 1883), 605. On 17 Dec., 1219, <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a>, with a view to a general reform among the religious of the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>, granted the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Sisters of St. Sixtus of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to St. Dominic, and the Institutions of Prouille were given to that <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> under the title of Institutions of the Sisters of St. Sixtus of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. With this designation they were granted subsequently to other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and congregations of religious. It is also under this form that we possess the primitive Institutions of Prouille, in the editions already mentioned. St. Dominic and his companions, having received from <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> authorization to choose a rule, with a view to the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of their order, adopted in 1216, that of St. Augustine, and added thereto the "Consuetudines" which regulated the ascetic and canonical life of the religious. These were borrowed in great part from the Constitutions of Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;, but with some essential features, adapted to the purposes of the new Preachers who also renounced private possession of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, but retained the revenues. The "Consuetudines" formed the first part <em>(prima distinctio) </em>of the primitive Constitutions of the order (Qu&eacute;tif-Echard, "Scriptores Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", L 12-13; <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, "Archiv. f&uuml;r Literatur und Kirchengeschichte", I, 194; Balme, "Cart.", II, 18). The order was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> approved, 22 Dec., 1216. A first letter, in the style of those granted for the foundation of regular canons, gave the order canonical existence; a second determined the special vocation of the Order of Preachers as vowed to teaching and defending the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. "Nos attendentes fratres Ordinis tui futuros pugiles fidei et vera mundi lumina confirmamus Ordinem tuum" (Balme, "Cart." II, 71-88; Potthast, 5402-5403). (Expecting the brethren of your order to be the champions of the Faith and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> lights of the world, we confirm your order.)

<p>On 15 Aug., 1217 St. Dominic sent out his companions from Prouille. They went through <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and established as principal centres, <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, Paris, <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and Bologna. Dominic, by constant journeyings, kept watch over these new establishments, and went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to confer with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Sovereign Pontiff</a> (Balme, "Cart." II, 131; "Annales Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", Rome, 1756, p. 411; Guiraud, "St. Dominic", Paris, 1899, p. 95). In May, 1220, St. Dominic held at Bologna the first general chapter of the order. This assembly drew up the Constitutions, which are complementary to the "Consuetudines" of 1216 and form the second part <em>(secunda distinctio). </em>They regulated the organization and life of the order, and are the essential and original basis of the Dominican legislation. In this chapter, the Preachers also gave up certain elements of the canonical life; they relinquished all possessions and revenues, and adopted the practice of strict poverty; they rejected the title of <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> for the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and substituted the <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a> of canons for the monastic <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a>. The regime of annual general chapters was established as the regulative power of the order, and the source of legislative authority. ("Script. Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", I, 20; <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, "Archiv.", I, 212; Balme, "Cart.", III, 575). Now that the legislation of the Friars Preachers was fully established, the Rule of the Sisters of St. Sixtus was found to be very incomplete. The order, however, supplied what was wanting by compiling a few years after, the <em>Statuta, </em>which borrowed from the Constitutions of the Friars, whatever might be useful in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Sisters. We owe the preservation of these <em>Statuta, </em>as well as the Rule of St. Sixtus, to the fact that this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a> was applied in 1232 to the Penitent Sisters of St. Mary Magdalen in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, who observed it without further modification. The <em>Statuta </em>are edited im Duellius, "Misc.", bk. I, 182. After the legislative work of the general chapters had been added to the Constitution of 1216-20, without changing the general ordinance of the primitive text, the necessity was felt, a quarter of a century later, of giving a more <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> distribution to the legislation in its entirety. The great canonist Raymond of Penaforte, on becoming master general of the order, devoted himself to this work. The general chapters, from 1239 to 1241, accepted the new text, and gave it the force of law. In this form it has remained to the present time as the official text, with some modification, however, in the way of suppressions and especially of additions due to later enactments of the general chapters. It was edited in <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, "Archiv.", V, 553; "Acta Capitulorum Generalium", I (Rome, 1898), II, 13, 18, in "Monum. Ord. Pr&aelig;d. Hist.", bk. III.



<p>The reorganization of the Constitutions of the Preachers called for a corresponding reform in the legislation of the Sisters. In his letter of 27 Aug., 1257, <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> ordered <a href="../cathen/07542a.htm">Humbert of Romans</a>, the fifth master general, to unify the Constitutions of the Sisters. Humbert remodelled them on the Constitutions of the Brothers, and put them into effect at the General Chapter of Valenciennes, 1259. The Sisters were henceforth characterized as <em>Sorores Ordinis Pr&aelig;dicatorum. </em>The Constitutions are edited in "Analecta, Ord. Pr&aelig;d." (Rome, 1897), 338; Finke, "Ungedruckte Dominicanerbriefe des 13 Jahrhunderts" (Paderborn, 1891), D. 53; "Litterae Encyclicae magistrorum generalium" (Rome, 1900), in "Mon. Ord. Praed. Hist.", V, p. 513. To this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, who had a large number of religious <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> under their care, added certain <em>admonitiones </em>by way of completing and definitely settling the Constitutions of the Sisters. They seem to be the work of Herman of <a href="../cathen/10323a.htm">Minden</a>, Provincial of Teutonia (1286-90). He drew up at first a concise admonition (<a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, "Archiv.", II, 549); then other series of admonitions, more important, which have not been edited (Rome, Archives of the Order, Cod. Ruten, 130-139). The legislation of the Friars Preachers is the firmest and most complete among the systems of law by which institutions of this sort were ruled in the thirteenth century. Hauck is correct in saying: "We do not deceive ourselves in considering the organization of the Dominican Order as the most perfect of all the monastic organizations produced by the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>" ("Kirchengeschichte Deutschlands", part IV, Leipzig, 1902, p. 390). It is not then surprising that the majority of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of the thirteenth century should have followed quite closely the Dominican legislation, which exerted an influence even upon institutions very dissimilar in aim and nature. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> considered it the typical rule for new foundations. <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> thought of making the legislation of the Order of Preachers into a special rule known as that of St. Dominic, and for that purpose commissioned the Dominican <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, Hugh of St. Cher (3 Feb., 1255), but the project encountered many obstacles, and nothing came of it. (Potthast, n. 1566; Humberti de Romanis, "Opera de vita regulari", ed., Berthier, I, Rome, 1888, n. 43)
<h3 id="B">Nature of the Order of Preachers</h3>

<h3 id="A">Its object</h3>

<p>The canonical title of "Order of Preachers", given to the work of St. Dominic by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is in itself significant, but it indicates only the dominant feature. The Constitutions are more explicit: "Our order was instituted principally for preaching and for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>." The end or aim of the order then is the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, especially by means of preaching. For the attainment of this purpose, the order must labour with the utmost <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> &#151; "Our main efforts should be put forth, earnestly and ardently, in doing good to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of our fellow-men."
<h3 id="B">Its organization</h3>

<p>The aim of the order and the conditions of its environment determined the form of its organization. The first organic group is the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, which may not be founded with less than twelve religious. At first only large <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> were allowed and these were located in important cities (Mon. Ger. Hist.: SS. XXXII, 233, 236), hence the saying:<blockquote><p><BR>Bernardus valles, montes Benedictus amabat, <BR>Oppida Franciscus, celebres Dominicus urbes. <BR>(Bernard <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> the valleys, <a href="../cathen/02467b.htm">Benedict</a> the mountains, Francis the towns, Dominic the populous cities). </p></blockquote>

<p>The foundation and the existence of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> required a prior as governor, and a doctor as teacher. The Constitution prescribes the dimensions of the church and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> buildings, and these should be quite plain. But in the course of the thirteenth century the order erected large edifices, real works of art. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> possesses nothing and lives on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. Outside of the choral office (the Preachers at first had the title of <em>canonici</em>) their time is wholly employed in study. The doctor gives lectures in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, at which all the religious, even the prior, must be present, and which are open to <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clerics</a>. The religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> themselves to preaching, both within and without the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> walls. The "general preachers" have the most extended powers. At the beginning of the order, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was called <em>praedicatio, </em>or <em>sancta praedicatio. </em>The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> divided up the territory in which they were established, and sent out on preaching tours religious who remained for a longer or shorter time in the principal places of their respective districts. The Preachers did not take the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of stability, but could be sent from one locality to another. Each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> received <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, these, according to the Constitutions, must be at least eighteen years of age, but this rule was not strictly observed. The Preachers were the first among <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders to suppress manual labour, the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> work of the interior of the house being relegated to <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> called <em>conversi </em>whose number was limited according to the needs of each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. The prior was elected by the religious and the doctor was appointed by the provincial chapter. The chapter, when it saw fit, relieved them from office.

<p>The grouping of a certain number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> forms the province, which is administered by a provincial prior, elected by the prior and two delegates from each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. He is confirmed by the general chapter, or by the master general, who can also remove him when it is found expedient. He enjoys in his province the same authority as the master general in the order; he confirms the election of conventual <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a>, visits the province, sees to it that the Constitutions and the ordinances are observed and presides at the provincial chapters. The provincial chapter, which is held annually, discusses the interests of the province. It is composed of a provincial prior, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, a delegate from each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, and the general preachers. The capitulants (members of the chapter), choose from among themselves, four counsellors or assistants, who, with the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a>, regulate the affairs brought before the chapter. The chapter appoints those who are to visit annually each part of the province. The provinces taken together constitute the order, which has at its head a master general, elected by the provincial <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> and by two delegates from each province. For a long time his position was for life; <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> (1804), reduced it to six years, and <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> (1862) fixed it at twelve years. At first the master general had no permanent residence; since the end of the fourteenth century, he has lived usually at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He visits the order, holds it to the observance of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and corrects abuses. In 1509, he was granted two associates <em>(socii); </em>in 1752, four; in 1910, five. The general chapter is the supreme authority within the order. From 1370, it was held every two years; from 1553, every three years, from 1625, every six years. In the eighteenth and at the beginning of the nineteenth century, chapters were rarely held. At present they take place every three years. From 1228, for two years in succession, the general chapter was composed of definitors or delegates from the provinces, each province sending one delegate; the following year it was held by the provincial <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a>. The chapter <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgates</a> new constitutions, but to become law they must be accepted by three constitutive chapters. The chapter deals with all the general concerns of the order, whether administrative or disciplinary. It corrects the master general, and in certain cases can depose him. From 1220 to 1244, the chapters were held alternately at Bologna and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; subsequently, they passed round to all the principal cities of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The generalissimo chapter acknowledged by the Constitution and composed of two definitors from each province, also of <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a>, i.e. equivalent to three consecutive general chapters, was held only in 1228 and 1236. The characteristic feature of government is the elective system which prevails throughout the order. "Such was the simple mechanism which imparted to the Order of Friars Preachers a powerful and regular movement, and secured them for a long time a real preponderance in Church and in State" (Delisle, "Notes et extraits des mss. de la Bibl. Nat.", Paris, xxvii, 1899, 2nd part, p. 312. See the editions of the Constitutions mentioned above: "Const. Ord. Fr. Pr&aelig;d.", Paris, 1, 1888, "Acta Capit. Gen. Ord. Fr. Pr&aelig;d.", ed., Reichert, Rome, 1898, sq. 9 vols.; Lo Cicero, Const., "Declar. et Ord. Capit. Gen. O. P.", Rome, 1892; Humbert de Romanis, "Opera de vita regulari", ed. Berthier, Rome, 1888; Reichert, "Feier und Geseh&auml;ftsordung der Provincialkapitel des Dominikanerordens im 13 Jahrhundert" in "R&ouml;mische Quart.", 1903, p. 101).
<h3 id="C">Forms of its activity</h3>

<p>The forms of life or activity of the Order of Preachers are many, but they are all duly subordinated. The order assimilated the ancient forms of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, the monastic and the canonical, but it made them subservient to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> and the apostolic life which are its peculiar and essential aims. The Preachers adopted from the monastic life the three traditional <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of obedience, chastity, and poverty; to them they added the ascetic element known as monastic observances; perpetual abstinence, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> from 14 Sept. until <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> and on all the Fridays throughout the year the exclusive use of wool for clothing and for the bed a hard bed, and a common dormitory, silence almost perpetual in their houses, public acknowledgment of faults in the chapter, a graded list of penitential practices, etc. The Preachers, however, did not take these observances directly from the monastic orders but from the regular canons, especially the reformed canons, who had already adopted monastic rules The Preachers received from the regular canons the choral Office for morning and evening, but chanted quickly. They added, on certain days, the Office of the Holy Virgin, and once a week the <a href="../cathen/11220a.htm">Office of the Dead</a>. The habit of the Preachers, as of the regular canons, is a white tunic and a black cloak. The <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a>, distinctive of the regular canons, was abandoned by the Preachers at the General Chapter of 1220, and replaced by the <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a>. At the same time they gave up various canonical customs, which they had retained up to that period. They suppressed in their order the title of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> for the head of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, and rejected all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, revenues, the carrying of money on their travels, and the use of horses. The title even of canon which they had borne from the beginning tended to disappear about the middle of the thirteenth century, and the General Chapters of 1240-1251 substituted the word <em>clericus </em>for <em>canonicus </em>in the article of the Constitutions relating to the admission of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>; nevertheless the designation, "canon" still occurs in some parts of the Constitutions. The Preachers, in fact, are primarily and essentially <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. The pontifical letter of foundation said: "These are to be the champions of the Faith and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> lights of the world." This could apply only to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. The Preachers consequently made study their chief occupation, which was the essential means, with preaching and teaching as the end. The apostolic character of the order was the complement of its <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> character. The Friars had to <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> themselves to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> through the ministry of preaching and confession, under the conditions set down by the Gospel and by the example of the Apostles: ardent <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, absolute poverty, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of life.

<p>The ideal Dominican life was rich in the multiplicity and choice of its elements, and was thoroughly unified by its well-considered principles and enactments; but it was none the less complex, and it, full realization was difficult. The monastic-canonical element tended to dull and paralyze the intense activity demanded by a clerical-apostolic life. The legislators warded off the difficulty by a system of <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a>, quite peculiar to the order. At the head of the Constitutions the principle of <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> appears jointly with the very definition of the order's purpose, and is placed before the text of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to show that it controls and tempers their application. "The superior in each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> shall have authority to grant <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> whenever he may deem it expedient, especially in regard to what may hinder study, or preaching, or the profit of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, since our order was originally established for the work of preaching and the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>", etc. The system of <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> thus broadly understood while it favoured the most active element of the order, displaced, but did not wholly eliminate, the difficulty. It created a sort of <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> in the interior life, and permitted an arbitrariness that might easily disquiet the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of the religious and of the superiors. The order warded off this new difficulty by declaring in the generalissimo chapter of 1236, that the Constitutions did not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">oblige</a> under pain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but under pain of doing penance (Acta Cap. Gen. I, 8.) This measure, however, was not heartily welcomed by everyone in the order (Humbert de Romanis, Op., II, 46), nevertheless it stood.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/05169a.htm">dualism</a> produced on one side, remarkable apostles and <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, on the other, stern ascetics and great mystics. At all events the interior troubles of the order grew out of the difficulty of maintaining the nice equilibrium which the first legislators established, and which was preserved to a remarkable degree during the first century of the order's existence. The <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> of things and historical circumstances frequently disturbed this equilibrium. The learned and active members tended to exempt themselves from monastic observance, or to moderate its strictness; the ascetic members insisted on the monastic life, and in pursuance of their aim, suppressed at different times the practice of <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, sanctioned as it was by the letter and the spirit of the Constitutions ["Cons". Ord. Praed.", passim;. <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, "Die Const. des Predigerordens" in "Archiv. f. Litt. u.

<h3 id="D">Nature of the Order of the Dominican Sisters</h3>

<p>We have indicated above the various steps by which the legislation of the Dominican Sisters was brought into conformity with the Constitutions of <a href="../cathen/07542a.htm">Humbert of Romans</a> (1259). The primitive type of religious established at Prouille in 1205 by St. Dominic was not affected by successive legislation. The Dominican Sisters are strictly <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a> in their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; they take the three religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, recite the canonical Hours in choir and engage in manual labor. The <em>eruditio litterarum </em>inscribed in the Institutions of St. Sixtus disappeared from the Constitutions drawn up by <a href="../cathen/07542a.htm">Humbert of Romans</a>. The ascetic life of the Sisters is the same as that of the Friars. Each house is governed by a <a href="../cathen/12428a.htm">prioress</a>, elected canonically, and assisted by a sub-prioress, a mistress of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and various other officers. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to hold <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in common; they must be provided with an income sufficient for the existence of the community; they are independent and are under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the provincial prior, the master general, and of the general chapter. A subsequent paragraph will deal with the various phases of the question as to the relation existing between the Sisters and the Order of Preachers. Whilst the Institutions of St. Sixtus provided a group of brothers, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and lay servants for the spiritual and temporal administration of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, the Constitutions of <a href="../cathen/07542a.htm">Humbert of Romans</a> were silent on these points. (See the legislative texts relating to the Sisters mentioned above.)
<h3 id="E">The Third Order</h3>

<p>St. Dominic did not write a rule for the Tertiaries, for reasons which are given further on in the historical sketch of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a>. However, a large body of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, vowed to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, grouped themselves about the rising Order of Preachers, and constituted, to all intents and purposes, a <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a>. In view of this fact and of some circumstances to be noted later on, the seventh master general of the order, Munio de Zamora, wrote (1285) a rule for the Brothers and Sisters of Penitence of St. Dominic. The privilege granted the new fraternity 28 Jan., 1286, by <a href="../cathen/07459a.htm">Honorius IV</a>, gave it a canonical existence (Potthast, 22358). The rule of Munio was not entirely original; some points being borrowed from the Rule of the Brothers of Penitence, whose origin dates back to <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>; but it was distinctive on all essential points. It is in a sense more thoroughly <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>; the Brothers and Sisters are grouped in different fraternities; their government is immediately subject to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority; and the various fraternities do not form a collective whole, with legislative chapters, as was the case among the Brothers of Penitence of St. Francis. The Dominican fraternities are local and without any bond of union other than that of the Preaching Brothers who govern them. Some characteristics of these fraternities may be gathered from the Rule of Munio de Zamora. The Brothers and Sisters, as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> children of St. Dominic, should be, above all things, truly <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Their habit is a white tunic, with black cloak and hood, and a leathern girdle. After making profession, they cannot return to the world, but may enter other authorized <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. They recited a certain number of Paters and Aves, for the canonical Hours; receive communion at least four times a year, and must show great respect to the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a>. They fast during <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>, <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, and on all the Fridays during the year, and eat meat only three days in the week, Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday. They are allowed to carry arms only in defense of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>. They visit sick members of the community, give them assistance if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, attend the burial of Brothers or Sisters and aid them with their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. The head or <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Order of Preachers, whom the Tertiaries select and propose to the master general or to the provincial; he may act on their petition or appoint some other religious. The director and the older members of the fraternity choose the prior or <a href="../cathen/12428a.htm">prioress</a>, from among the Brothers and Sisters, and their office continues until they are relieved. The Brothers and the Sisters have, on different days, a monthly reunion in the church of the Preachers, when they attend Mass, listen to an instruction, and to an explanation of the rule. The prior and the director can grant <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a>; the rule, like the Constitutions of the Preachers, does not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">oblige</a> under pain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<h2 id="section2">History of the order</h2>
<h3 id="A">The Friars Preachers</h3>

<p>Their history may be divided into three periods: (1) The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> (from their foundation to the beginning of the sixteenth century); (2) The Modern Period up to the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>; (3) The Contemporaneous Period. In each of these periods we shall examine the work of the order in its various departments.
<h3 id="A">The Middle Ages</h3>

<p>The thirteenth century is the classic age of the order, the witness to its brilliant development and intense activity. This last is manifested especially in the work of teaching. By preaching it reached all classes of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, fought <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>, by word and book, and by its missions to the north of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, to <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, passed beyond the frontiers of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. Its <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> spread throughout the entire Church its <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> wrote monumental works in all branches of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and two among them, <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a>, and especially <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a>, founded a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> which was to rule the ages to come in the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. An enormous number of its members held offices in <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> &#151; as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, inquisitors, confessors of princes, ambassadors, and <em>paciarii </em>(enforcers of the peace decreed by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> or councils). The Order of Preachers, which should have remained a select body, developed beyond bounds and absorbed some elements unfitted to its form of life. A period of relaxation ensued during the fourteenth century owing to the general decline of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. The weakening of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> activity favoured the development here and there of the ascetic and contemplative life and there sprang up, especially in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, an intense and exuberant <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> with which the names of <a href="../cathen/05274a.htm">Master Eckhart</a>, <a href="../cathen/07238c.htm">Suso</a>, <a href="../cathen/14465c.htm">Tauler</a>, <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a> are associated. This movement was the prelude to the reforms undertaken, at the end of the century, by Raymond of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, and continued in the following century. It assumed remarkable proportions in the congregations of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> and of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and in the reforms of <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a> at Florence. At the same time the order found itself face to face with the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. It struggled against <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> tendencies in <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> through Dominici and <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> through the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of Cologne but it also furnished <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> with such advanced writers as Francis Colonna (Poliphile) and Matthew Brandello. Its members, in great numbers, took part im the artistic activity of the age, the most prominent being <a href="../cathen/01483b.htm">Fra Angelico</a> and <a href="../cathen/02318a.htm">Fra Bartolomeo</a>.

<p><em>(a) Development and Statistics</em>

<p>When St. Dominic, in 1216, asked for the official recognition of his order, the first Preachers numbered only sixteen. At the general Chapter of Bologna, 1221, the year of St. Dominic's death, the order already counted some sixty establishments, and was divided into eight provinces: <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, Provence, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Teutonia, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. The Chapter of 1228 added four new provinces: the Holy Land, <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and Dacia (Denmark and Scandinavia). <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> was separated from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1294), <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (1301). In 1303 <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> was divided into Upper and Lower <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>; Provence into <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and Provence; Saxony was separated from Teutonia, and <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> from <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, thus forming eighteen provinces. The order, which in 1277 counted 404 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of Brothers, in 1303 numbered nearly 600. The development of the order reached its height during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; new houses were established during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, but in relatively small numbers As to the number of religious only approximate statements can be given. In 1256, according to the concession of suffrages granted by <a href="../cathen/07542a.htm">Humbert of Romans</a> to St. Louis, the order numbered about 5000 priests; the clerks and <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> could not have been less than 2000. Thus towards the middle of the thirteenth century it must have had about 7000 members (de Laborde, "Layette du tr&eacute;sor des chartes", <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> 1875, III, 304). According to Sebastien de Olmeda, the Preachers, as shown by the census taken under <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a>, were close on to 12,000 in 1337. (Fontana, "Monumenta Dominicana", Rome, 1674, pp. 207-8). This number was not surpassed at the close of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; the Great Plague of 1348, and the general state of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> preventing a notable increase, The reform movement begun in 1390 by Raymond of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a> established the principle of a twofold arrangement in the order. For a long time it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the reformed <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> were not separate from their respective provinces; but with the foundation of the congregation of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, in 1459, a new order of things began. The congregations were more or less self-governing, and, according as they developed, overlapped several provinces and even several nations. There were established successively the congregations of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> (1460), <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> (1464), <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (1468), St. Mark in Florence (1493), <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1497), the Gallican (1514). About the same time some new provinces were also established: <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> (1481), <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> (1484), B&eacute;tique or Andalusia (1514), Lower <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (1515). (Qu&eacute;tif-Echard, "Script. Ord. Praed.", I, p. 1-15; "Anal. Ord. Praed.", 1893, <em>passim; </em>Mortier, "Hist. des Ma&icirc;tres G&eacute;n&eacute;raux", I-V, <em>passim</em>).

<p><em>(b) Administration</em>

<p>The Preachers possessed a number of able administrators among their masters general during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, especially in the thirteenth century. St. Dominic, the creator of the institution (1206-1221), showed a keen intelligence of the needs of the age. He executed his plans with sureness of insight, firmness of resolution, and tenacity of purpose. Jordan of Saxony (1222-1237) sensitive, eloquent, and endowed with rare powers of persuasion, attracted numerous and valuable recruits. St. Raymond of Penaforte (1238-1240), the greatest canonist of the age, ruled the order only long enough to reorganize its legislation. John the Teuton (1241-1252), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and linguist, who was associated with the greatest personalities of his time pushed the order forward along the line of development outlined by its founder. <a href="../cathen/07542a.htm">Humbert of Romans</a> (1254-1263), a genius of the practical sort, a broad-minded and moderate man, raised the order to the height of its glory, and wrote manifold works, setting forth what, in his eyes, the Preachers and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> ought to be. John of <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> (1264-1283), an energetic and prudent man, during his long government maintained the order in all its vigor. The successors of these illustrious masters did their utmost in the discharge of their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, and in meeting the situations which the state of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> from the close of the thirteenth century rendered more and more difficult. Some of them did no more than hold their high office, while others had not the genius of the masters general of the golden age [Balme-Lelaidier, "Cart. de St. Dominic"; Guiraud, "St. Dominic" (Paris, 1899); Mothon, "Vie du B. Jourdain de Saxe" (Paris, 1885); Reichert, "Des Itinerar des zweiten Dominikaner-generals Jordanis von Sachsen" in "Festschrift des Deutschen Campo Santo in Rom" (Freiburg, 1897) 153; Mothon, "Vita del B. Giovanini da Vecellio" (Vecellio 1903); Mortier, "Histoire des Ma&icirc;tres G&eacute;n&eacute;raux", I-V]. The general chapters which wielded supreme power were the great regulators of the Dominican life during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. They are usually remarkable for their spirit of decision, and the firmness with which they ruled. They appeared even imbued with a severe character which, taking no account of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, bore witness to the importance they attached to the maintenance of discipline. (See the Acta Cap. Gen. already referred to.)

<p><em>(c) Modification of the Statute</em>

<p>We have already spoken of the chief exception to be taken to the Constitution of the order, the difficulty of maintaining an even balance between the monastic and canonical observances and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> and apostolical life. The primitive r&eacute;gime of poverty, which left the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> without an assured income, created also a permanent difficulty. Time and the modifications of the state of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> exposed these weak points. Already the General Chapters of 1240-1242 forbade the changing of the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the order, a measure which would indicate at least a hidden tendency towards modification (Acta, I, p. 14-20). Some change seems to have been contemplated also by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> when <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a>, 4 February, 1255, ordered the Dominican <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/07521b.htm">Hugh of Saint Cher</a>, to recast the entire legislation of the Preachers into a rule which should be called the Rule of St. Dominic (Potthast, 156-69). Nothing came of the project, and the question was broached again about 1270 (Humbert de Romanis, "Opera", I, p. 43). It was during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a>, (1334-1342), who undertook a general reform of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, that the Preachers were on the point of undergoing serious modifications in the secondary elements of their primitive statute. Benedict, desiring to give the order greater efficiency, sought to impose a r&eacute;gime of property-holding as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to its security and to reduce the number of its members (12,000) by eliminating the unfit etc.; in a word, to lead the order back to its primitive concept of a select apostolic and teaching body. The order, ruled at that time by Hugh de Vansseman (1333-41), resisted with all its strength (1337-40). This was a mistake (Mortier, op. cit., III, 115). As the situation grew worse, the order was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to petition <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to hold <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and this was granted 1 June, 1475. Thence forward the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> could acquire <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and perpetual rentals (Mortier, IV, p. 495). This was one of the causes which quickened the vitality of the order in the sixteenth century.

<p>The reform projects of <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a> having failed, the master general, Raymond of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a> (1390) sought to restore the monastic observances which had fallen into decline. He ordered the establishment in each province of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of strict observance, hoping that as such houses became more numerous, the reform would eventually permeate the entire province. This was not usually the case. These houses of the observance formed a confederation among themselves under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of a special vicar. However, they did not cease to belong to their original province in certain respects, and this, naturally gave rise to numerous conflicts of government. During the fifteenth century, several groups made up congregations, more or less autonomous; these we have named above in giving the statistics of the order. The scheme of reform proposed by Raymond and adopted by nearly all who subsequently took up with his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, insisted on the observance of the Constitutions <em>ad unguem, </em>as Raymond, without further explanation, expressed it. By this, his followers, and, perhaps Raymond himself, understood the suppression of the rule of <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> which governed the entire Dominican legislation. "In suppressing the power to grant and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to accept <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, the reformers inverted the economy of the order, setting the part above the whole, and the means above the end" (Lacordaire, "M&eacute;moire pour la restauration des Fr&egrave;res L Pr&ecirc;cheurs dans la chr&eacute;tienit&eacute;", new ed., Dijon, 1852, p. 18). The different reforms which originated within the order up to the nineteenth century, began usually with principles of asceticism, which exceeded the letter and the spirit of the original constitutions. This initial exaggeration was, under pressure of circumstances, toned down, and the reforms which endured, like that of the congregation of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, turned out to be the most effectual. Generally speaking, the reformed communities slackened the intense devotion to study prescribed by the Constitutions; they did not produce the great <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of the order, and their literary activity was directed preferably to <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, history, subjects of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and asceticism. They gave to the fifteenth century many holy men (Thomae Antonii Senesis, "Historia disciplin&aelig; regularis instaurata in Cnobiis Venetis Ord. Pr&aelig;d." in Fl. Cornelius, "Ecclesi&aelig; Venet&aelig;", VII, 1749, p. 167; Bl. Raymond of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, "Opuscula et Litterae", Rome, 1899; Meyer, "Buch der Reformacio Predigerordens" in "Quellen und Forschungen zur Geschichte des Dominikanerordens in Deutschland", II, III, Leipzig 1908-9; Mortier, "Hist. des Ma&icirc;tres G&eacute;n&eacute;raux", III, IV).

<p><em>(d) Preaching and Teaching</em>

<p>Independently of their official title of Order of Preachers, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> especially delegated the Preachers to the office of preaching. It is in fact the only order of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> declared to be specially charged with this office (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Ord. Pr&aelig;d., VIII, p. 768). Conformably to its mission, the order displayed an enormous activity. The "Vit&aelig; Fratrum" (1260) (Lives of the Brothers) informs us that many of the brothers refused food until they had first announced the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (op. cit., p. 150). In his circular letter (1260), the Master General <a href="../cathen/07542a.htm">Humbert of Romans</a>, in view of what had been accomplished by his religious, could well make the statement: "We teach the people, we teach the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, we teach the wise and the unwise, religious and seculars, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, nobles and peasants, lowly and great." (Monum. Ord. Pr&aelig;d. Historia, V, p. 53). Rightly, too, it has been said: "Science on one hand, numbers on the other, placed them [the Preachers] ahead of their competitors in the thirteenth century" (Lecoy de la Marche, "La chaire fran&ccedil;aise au Moyen Age", Paris, 1886, p. 31). The order maintained this supremacy during the entire <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> (L. Pfleger, "Zur Geschichte des Predigtwesens in Strasburg", <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, 1907, p. 26; F. Jostes, "Zur Geschichte der Mittelalterlichen Predigt in Westfalen", M&uuml;nster, 1885, p. 10). During the thirteenth century, the Preachers in addition to their regular apostolate, worked especially to lead back to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and renegade <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. An eyewitness of their labours (1233) reckons the number of their converts in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> at more than 100,000 ("Annales Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", Rome, 1756, col. 128). This movement grew rapidly, and the witnesses could scarcely believe their eyes, as <a href="../cathen/07542a.htm">Humbert of Romans</a> (1255) informs us (Opera, II, p. 493). At the beginning of the fourteenth century, a celebrated <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator, Giordano da Rivalto, declared that, owing to the activity of the order, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> had almost entirely disappeared from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ("Prediche del Beato Fra Giordano da Rivalto", <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1831, I, p. 239).

<p>The Friars Preachers were especially authorized by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> to preach <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a>, against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> in favour of the Holy Land, against Livonia and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and against <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, and his successors (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. O. P., XIII, p. 637). This preaching assumed such importance that <a href="../cathen/07542a.htm">Humbert of Romans</a> composed for the purpose a treatise entitled, "Tractatus de pr&aelig;dicatione contra Saracenos infideles et paganos" (Tract on the preaching of the Cross against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, infidels and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>). This still exists in its first edition in the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Biblioth&egrave;que Mazarine, incunabula no. 259; Lecoy de la Marche, "La pr&eacute;dication de la Croisade au XIIIe si&egrave;cle" in "Rev. des questions historiques", 1890, p. 5). In certain provinces, particularly in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the Dominican preaching took on a peculiar quality, due to the influence of the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> which the religious of these provinces gave to the numerous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> confided to their care. It was a mystical preaching; the specimens which have survived are in the vernacular, and are marked by simplicity and strength (<a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, "Uber die Anf&auml;nge der Predigtweise der deutschen Mystiker" in "Archiv. f. Litt. u. Kirchengesch", II, p. 641; Pfeiffer, "Deutsche Mystiker des vierzehnten Jahrhundert", Leipzig, 1845; Wackernagel, "Altdeutsche Predigten und Gebete aus Handschriften", Basle, 1876). Among these preachers may be mentioned: St. Dominic, the founder and model of preachers (d. 1221); Jordan of Saxony (d. 1237) (Lives of the Brothers, pts. II, III); Giovanni di Vincenza, whose popular eloquence stirred Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> during the year 1233 &#151; called the Age of the <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a> (Sitter, "Johann von Vincenza und die Italiensche Friedensbewegung", Freiburg, 1891); Giordano da Rivalto, the foremost <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> orator in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> at the beginning of the fourteenth century [d. 1311 (Galletti, "Fra Giordano da Pisa", Turin, 1899)]; <a href="../cathen/05274a.htm">Johann Eckhart of Hochheim</a> (d. 1327), the celebrated theorist of the mystical life (Pfeiffer, "Deutsche Mystiker", II, 1857; Buttner, "Meister Eckharts Schriften und Predigten", Leipzig, 1903); <a href="../cathen/07238c.htm">Henri Suso</a> (d. 1366), the poetical lover of Divine wisdom (Bihlmeyer, "Heinrich Seuse Deutsche Schriften", Stuttgart, 1907); <a href="../cathen/14465c.htm">Johann Tauler</a> (d. 1361), the eloquent moralist ("Johanns Taulers Predigten" ed. T. Harnberger, Frankfort, 1864); Venturino la Bergamo (d. 1345), the fiery popular agitator (Clementi, "Un Santo Patriota, Il B. Venturino da Bergamo", Rome, 1909); Jacopo Passavanti (d. 1357), the noted author of the "Mirror of Penitence" (Carmini di Pierro, "Contributo alla Biografia di Fra Jacopo Passavanti" in "Giornale storico della letteratura italiana", XLVII, 1906 p. 1); Giovanni Dominici (d. 1419), the beloved orator of the Florentines (Gallette, "Una <a href="../cathen/12620a.htm">Raccolta</a> di Prediche volgari del Cardinale Giovanni Dominici" in "Miscellanea di studi critici publicati in onore di G. Mazzoni", <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1907, I); Alain de la Rochei (d. 1475), the Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> (Script. Ord. Pr&aelig;d., I, p. 849); <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a> (d. 1498), one of the most powerful orators of all times (Luotto, "II vero Savonarola", <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, p. 68).

<p><em>(e) Academic Organization</em>

<p>The first order instituted by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with an academic mission was the Preachers. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> (1215) requiring the appointment of a master of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> for each <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> had not been effectual. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and St. Dominic met the needs of the situation by creating a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order vowed to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a>. To attain their purpose, the Preachers from 1220 laid down as a fundamental principle, that no <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of their order could be founded without a doctor (Const., Dist. II, cog. I). From their first foundation, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, likewise, welcomed them with expressions like those of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> (22 April, 1221): "Cohabitatio ipsorum non tantum laicis in praedicationibus, sed et clericis in sacris lectionibus esset plurimum profutura, exemplo Domini Pap&aelig;, qui eis Rom&aelig; domum contulit, et multorum archiepiscoporum ac episcoporum" etc. (Annales Ord. Pr&aelig;d. I, append., col. 71). (Association with them would be of great value not only to <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> by their preaching, but also to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> by their lectures on <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred science</a>, as it was to the Lord Pope who gave them their house at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and to many <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.) This is the reason why the second master general, Jordan of Saxony, defined the vocation of the order: "honeste vivere, discere et docere", i.e. upright living, learning and teaching (Vit&aelig; Fratrum, p. 138); and one of his successors, John the Teuton, declared that he was "ex ordine Praedicatorum, quorum proprium esset docendi munus" (Annales, p. 644). (Of the Order of Preachers whose proper function was to teach.) In pursuit of this aim the Preachers established a very complete and thoroughly organized scholastic system, which has <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> a writer of our own times to say that "Dominic was the first minister of public instruction in modern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>" (Larousse, "Grand Dictionnaire; Universel du XIXe Si&egrave;cle", s.v. Dominic).

<p>The general basis of teaching was the conventual <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. It was attended by the religious of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> from the outside; the teaching was public. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was directed by a doctor, called later, though not in all cases, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>. His principal subject was the text of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, which he interpreted, and in connection with which he treated <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> questions. The "Sentences" of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, the "History" of <a href="../cathen/11763b.htm">Peter Comestor</a>, the "Sum" of cases of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, were also, but secondarily, used as texts. In the large <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, which were not called <em>studia generalia, </em>but were in the language of the times <em>studia solemnia, </em>the teaching staff was more complete. There was a second master or sub-rector, or a bachelor, whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it was to lecture on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and the "Sentences". This organization somewhat resembled that of the <em>studia generalia. </em>The head master held public disputations every fortnight. Each <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> possessed a <em>magister studentium, </em>charged with the superintendence of the students, and usually an assistant teacher. These masters were appointed by the provincial chapters, and the visitors were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to report each year to the chapter on the condition of academic work. Above the conventual <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were the <em>studia generalia. </em>The first <em>studium generale</em> which the order possessed was that of the Convent of St. Jacques at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. In 1229 they obtained a chair incorporated with the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and another in 1231. Thus the Preachers were the first <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order that took part in teaching at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, and the only one possessing two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. In the thirteenth century the order did not recognize any mastership of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> other than that received at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Usually the masters did not teach for any length of time. After receiving their degrees, they were assigned to different <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the order throughout the world. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of St. Jacques at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> were the principal scholastic centres of the Preachers during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>.

<p>In 1248 the development of the order led to the erection of four new <em>studia generalia &#151; </em>at Oxford, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>, and Bologna. When at the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth century several provinces of the order were divided, other <em>studia </em>were established at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, and Salamanca. The <em>studium generale </em>was conducted by a master or regent, and two bachelors who taught under his direction. The master taught the text of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> with commentaries. The works of <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a> and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> show us the nature of these lessons. Every fifteen days the master held a debate upon a theme chosen by himself. To this class of exercises belong the "Qu&aelig;stiones Disputat&aelig;" of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, while his "Quaestiones Quodlibeticae" represent extraordinary disputations which took place twice a year during <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> and <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> and whose subject was proposed by the auditors. One of the bachelors read and commentated the Book of Sentences. The commentaries of Albert and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a> on the Lombard are the fruit of their two-year baccalaureate course as <em>sententiarii</em>. The <em>biblicus </em>lectured on the Scriptures for one year before becoming a <em>sententiarius. </em>He did not commentate, but read and interpreted the glosses which preceding ages had added to the Scriptures for better understanding of the text. The professors of the <em>studia generalia </em>were appointed by the general chapters, or by the master general, delegated for the purpose. Those who were to teach at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> were taken indiscriminately from the different provinces of the order.

<p>The conventual <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> taught only the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a>, i.e. <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. At the beginning of the thirteenth century neither <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> nor religious studied or taught the profane <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> As it could not set itself against this general status the order provided in its constitutions, that the master general, or the general chapter, might allow certain religious to take up the study of the liberal arts Thus, at first, the study of the arts, i.e. of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> was entirely individual. As numerous masters of arts entered the order during the early years, especially at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Bologna, it was easy to make a stand against this private teaching. However, the development of the order and the rapid <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> progress of the thirteenth century soon caused the organization &#151; for the use of religious only &#151; of regular <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the study of the liberal arts. Towards the middle of the century the provinces established in one or more of their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> the study of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>; and about 1260 the <em>studia naturalium</em>, i.e. courses in natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. The General Chapter of 1315 commended the masters of the students to lecture on the moral <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> to all the religious of their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>; i.e. on the ethics, politics, and economics of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>. From the beginning of the fourteenth century we find also some religious who gave special courses in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> to secular students. In the fifteenth century the Preachers occupied in several <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> chairs of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, especially of <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a>. Coming in contact as it did with barbaric peoples &#151; principally with the Greeks and <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> &#151; the order was compelled from the outset to take up the study of foreign languages. The Chapter Generalissimo of 1236 ordered that in all <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and in all the provinces the religious should learn the languages of the neighbouring countries. The following year Brother Phillippe, Provincial of the Holy Land, wrote to <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> that his religious had preached to the people in the different languages of the Orient, especially in Arabic, the most popular tongue, and that the study of languages had been added to their conventual course. The province of Greece furnished several Hellenists whose works we shall mention later. The province of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, whose population was a mixture of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a>, opened special <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the study of languages. About the middle of the thirteenth century it also established a <em>studium arabicum </em>at <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a>; in 1259 one at <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>; between 1265 and 1270 one at Murcia; in 1281 one at Valencia. The same province also established some <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the study of Hebrew at Barcelona in 1281, and at Jativa in 1291. Finally, the General Chapters of 1310 commanded the master general to establish, in several provinces, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for the study of Hebrew, Greek, and Arabic, to which each province of the order should send at least one student. In view of this fact a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> historian, Molmier, in writing of the Friars Preachers, remarks: "They were not content with professing in their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> all the divisions of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, as it was then understood; they added an entire order of studies which no other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the time seem to have taught, and in which they had no other rivals than the rabbis of Languedoc and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>" ("Guillem Bernard de Gaillac et l'enseignement chez les Dominicains", Paris, 1884, p. 30).

<p>This scholastic activity extended to other fields, particularly to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> which were established throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> from the beginning of the thirteenth century; the Preachers took a prominent part in <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> life. Those <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, like <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> etc., which from the beginning had chairs of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, incorporated the Dominican conventual <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which was patterned on the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the <em>studia generalia</em>. When a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was established as in a city &#151; as was usually the case &#151; after the foundation of a Dominican <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> which always possessed a chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, the pontifical letters granting the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> made no mention whatever of a faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The latter was considered as already existing by reason of the Dominican <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and others of the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a>, who followed the example of the Preachers. For a time in the Dominican <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were simply in juxtaposition to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, which had no faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. When these <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> petitioned the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for a faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and their petition was granted, they usually incorporated the Dominican <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which thus became a part of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty. This transformation began towards the close of the fourteenth and lasted until the first years of the sixteenth century. Once established, this state of things lasted until the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in the countries which became <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, and until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> and its spread in the Latin countries.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, who according to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> (1215) were to establish each <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church a master of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, considered themselves dispensed from this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> by reason of the creation of Dominican <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> open to the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>. However, when they thought it their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to apply the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the council, or when later they were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> to do so, they frequently called in a Dominican master to fill the chair of their <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Thus the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> was entrusted to the Preachers, from their establishment in that city until the beginning of the sixteenth century (Forest, "L'&eacute;cole cath&eacute;dralede Lyon", Paris-Lyons, 1885, pp. 238, 368; Beyssac, Les Prieurs de Notre Dame de Confort", Lyons, 1909; "Chart. Univer. Paris", III, p. 28). The same arrangement, though not so permanent, was made at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, <a href="../cathen/14785a.htm">Tortosa</a>, <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, <a href="../cathen/15223b.htm">Urgel</a>, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> etc. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, who believed themselves morally obligated to set an example regarding the execution of the scholastic <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Lateran Council, usually contented themselves during the thirteenth century with the establishment of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the Dominicans and other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. The Dominican masters who taught at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> or in other cities where the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiffs</a> took up their residence, were known as <em>lectores curiae</em>. However, when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, once settled at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, began to require from the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> the execution of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of Lateran, they instituted a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in their own <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> palace; the initiative was taken by <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> (1305-1314). At the request of the Dominican, Cardinal Nicolas Alberti de <a href="../cathen/12117a.htm">Prato</a> (d. 1321), this work was permanently entrusted to a Preacher, bearing the name of <em>Magister Sacri Palatii. </em>The first to hold the position was Pierre Godin, who later became <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> (1312). The office of <a href="../cathen/10039a.htm">Master of the Sacred Palace</a>, whose functions were successively increased, remains to the present day the special privilege of the Order of Preachers (Catalani, "De Magistro Sacri Palatii Apostolici", <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, p. 175).

<p>Finally, when towards the middle of the thirteenth century the old monastic orders began to take up the scholastic and <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> movement, the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, in particular, applied to the Preachers for masters of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in their <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> ("Chart. Univ Paris", I, p. 184). During the last portion of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, the Dominicans furnished, at intervals, professors to the different orders, not themselves <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to study (<a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, "Quellen zur Gelehrtengeschichte des Predigerordens im 13. und 14. Jahrhundert" in "Archiv." II, p. 165; Mandonnet, "Les Chanoines Pr&ecirc;cheurs de Bologne", Fribourg, 1903; Douais, "Essai sur l'organisation des &eacute;tudes dans l'Ordre des Fr&egrave;res-Pr&ecirc;cheurs", Paris, 1884; Mandonnet, "De l'incorporation des Dominicains dans l'ancienne Universit&eacute;de Paris" in "Revue Thomiste", IV 1896, p. 139; <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, "Die Universit&auml;ten des Mittelalters", <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1885; I, <em>passim; </em>Denifle-Chatelain, "Chart. Univ., Paris", 1889, <em>passim; </em>Bernard, Les Dominicains dans l'Universit&eacute;de Paris", Paris, 183; Mandonnet, "Siger de Brabant et l'averroisme Latin au XIIIe si&egrave;cle", Louvain, 1911, I, n. 30-95). The legislation regarding studies occurs here and there in the constitutions, and principally in the "Acta Capitularium Generalium", Rome, 1898, sq. and Douais, "Acta Capitulorum Provincialium" (Toulouse, 1894).

<p>The teaching activity of the order and its scholastic organization placed the Preachers in the forefront of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. They were the pioneers in all directions as one may see from a subsequent paragraph relative to their literary productions. We speak only of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> created by them in the thirteenth century which has been the most influential in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a>. At the beginning of the thirteenth century <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> teaching was confined practically to the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and was under the influence of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>; hence the name Augustinism generally given to the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> doctrines of that age. The first Dominican <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, who came from the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> into the order, or who taught in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, adhered for a long time to the Augustinian <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Among the most celebrated were Roland of <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, <a href="../cathen/07521b.htm">Hugh of Saint Cher</a>, Richard Fitzacre, <a href="../cathen/10479a.htm">Moneta of Cremona</a>, Peter of <a href="../cathen/14454a.htm">Tarentaise</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08644a.htm">Robert of Kilwardby</a>. It was the introduction into the Latin world of the great works of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, and their assimilation, through the action of <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a>, that opened up in the Order of Preachers a new line of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> investigation. The work begun by <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a> (1240-1250) was carried to completion by his disciple, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a> (q.v.), whose teaching activity occupied the last twenty years of his life (1245-1274). The system of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and philosophy constructed by Aquinas is the most complete, the most original, and the most profound, which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> thought has elaborated, and the master who designed it surpasses all his contemporaries and his successors in the grandeur of his creative genius. The <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomist</a> School developed rapidly both within the order and without. The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries witnessed the struggles of the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomist</a> School on various points of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. The Council of Vienne (1311) declared in favour of the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> teaching, according to which there is but one form in the human composition, and condemned as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> any one who should deny that "the rational or intellective <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is per se and essentially the form of the human body". This is also the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/09018b.htm">Fifth Lateran Council</a> (1515). See Zigliara, "De Mente Concilii Viennensis", Rome, 1878, pp. 88-89.

<p>The discussions between the Preachers and the Friars on the poverty of Christ and the Apostles was also settled by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> sense [(12 Nov., 1323), Ehrle, "Archiv. f. Litt. u Kirchengesch.", III, p. 517; Tocco, "La Questione della povert&agrave; nel Secolo XIV", Naples, 1910]. The question regarding the Divinity of the Blood of Christ separated from His Body during His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, raised for the first time in 1351, at <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, and taken up again in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 1463, was the subject of a formal debate before <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>. The Dominican opinion prevailed; although the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> refused a sentence properly so called (Mortier, "Hist. des Ma&icirc;tres G&eacute;n&eacute;raux", III, p. 287, IV, p. 413; G. degli Agostini, "Notizie istorico-critiche intorno la vita e le opere degli scrittori Viniziani", <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1752, I, p. 401. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomist</a> School had to make a stand against <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a>, of which a Preacher had been one of the protagonists. The repeated sentences of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> and of princes slowly combatted this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> (De Wulf, "Histoire de la philosophic m&eacute;di&eacute;vale", Louvain-Paris, 1905, p. 453).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroism</a> against which <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albert the Great</a> and especially <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Aquinas</a> had fought so energetically did not disappear entirely with the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1277), but survived under a more or less attenuated form. At the beginning of the sixteenth century the debates were renewed, and the Preachers found themselves actively engaged therein in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> where the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroist</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> had reappeared. The General of the Dominicans, Thomas de Vio (Cajetan) had published his commentaries on the "De Anima" of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> (Florence, 1509), in which, abandoning the position of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, he contended that <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> had not taught the individual <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but affirming at the same time that this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was philosophically <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>. The Council of Lateran, by its <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a>, 19 Dec., 1513, not only condemned the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroistic</a> teaching, but exacted still further that professors of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> should answer the opposing arguments advanced by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> &#151; a measure which Cajetan did not approve (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Councils", I, 32, col. 842). Pietro Pomponazzi, having published at Bologna (1516) his treatise on the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroistic</a> sense, while making an open profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>, raised numerous polemics, and was held as a suspect. Chrysostom Javelli, regent of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the Convent of St. Dominic, in agreement with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, and at the request of Pomponazzi, sought to extricate him from this difficulty by drawing up a short <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> expos&eacute; of the question which was to be added in the future to the work of Pomponazzi. But this discussion did not cease all at once. Several Dominicans entered the lists. Girolamo de Fornariis subjected to examination the polemic of Pomponazzi with Augustin Nifi (Bologna, 1519); Bartolommeo de Spina attacked Cajetan on one article, and Pomponazzi in two others (Venice, 1519); Isidore of Isolanis also wrote on the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (Milan, 1520); Lucas Bettini took up the same theme, and Pico della Mirandola published his treatise (Bologna, 1523); finally Chrysostom Javelli himself, in 1523, composed a treatise on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> in which he refuted the point of view of Cajetan and of Pomponazzi (Chrysostomi Javelli, "Opera", <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1577, I-III, p. 52). Cajetan, becoming <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, not only held his position regarding the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, but further declared that the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was an <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a>, for which philosophy could offer only probable reasons ("In Ecclesiasten", 1534, cap. iv; Fiorentino, "Pietro Pomponazzi", Florence, 1868).

<p><em>(f) Literary and Scientific Productions</em>

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the order had an enormous literary output, its activity extending to all spheres. The works of its writers are epoch-making in the various branches of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.

<p>(i) Works on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. &#151; The study and teaching of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> were foremost among the occupations of the Preachers, and their studies included everything pertaining to it. They first undertook correctories <em>(correctoria) </em>of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> text (1230-36), under the direction of <a href="../cathen/07521b.htm">Hugh of Saint Cher</a>, professor at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. The collation with the Hebrew text was accomplished under the sub-prior of St-Jacques, Theobald of Sexania, a converted <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a>. Two other correctories were made prior to 1267, the first called the correctory of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>. Again under the direction of <a href="../cathen/07521b.htm">Hugh of Saint Cher</a> the Preachers made the first concordances of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> which were called the Concordances of St. Jacques or Great Concordances because of their development. The <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> Dominicans of Oxford, apparently under the direction of John of Darlington, made more simplified concordances in the third quarter of the thirteenth century. At the beginning of the fourteenth century a German Dominican, Conrad of Halberstadt simplified the English concordances still more; and John Fojkowich of <a href="../cathen/12633c.htm">Ragusa</a>, at the time of the Council of Basle, caused the insertion in the concordances of elements which had not hitherto been incorporated in them. The Dominicans, moreover, composed numerous commentaries on the books of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. That of <a href="../cathen/07521b.htm">Hugh of Saint Cher</a> was the first complete commentary on the Scriptures (last ed., Venice, 1754, 8 vols. in fol.). The commentaries of Bl. <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a> and especially those of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> are still famous. With <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> the interpretation of the text is more direct, simply literal, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>. These great Scriptural commentaries represent <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> teaching in the <em>studia generalia. </em>The <em>lecturae </em>on the text of Scripture, also composed to a large extent by Dominicans, represent scriptural teaching in the other <em>studia </em>of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. St. Thomas undertook an "Expositio continua" of the four Gospels now called the "Catena aurea", composed of extracts from the Fathers with a view to its use by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. At the beginning of the fourteenth century <a href="../cathen/15063b.htm">Nicholas of Trevet</a> did the same for all the books of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. The Preachers were also engaged in translating the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> into the vernacular. In all probability they were the translators of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> Bible during the first half of the thirteenth century, and in the fourteenth century they took a very active share in the translation of the celebrated Bible of King John. The name of a <a href="../cathen/03428a.htm">Catalonian</a> Dominican, Romeu of Sabruguera, is attached to the first translation of the Scriptures into Catalonian. The names of Preachers are also connected with the Valencian and <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> translations, and still more with the Italian (F.L. Mannoci, "Intorno a un volgarizzamento della Biblia attribuita al B. Jacopo da Voragine" in "Giornale storico e letterario della Liguria", V, 1904, p. 96). The first pre-Lutheran German translation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, except the Psalms, is due to John Rellach, shortly after the middle of the fifteenth century. Finally the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> was translated from Latin into <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> about 1330 by B. Bartolommeo Parvi of Bologna, missionary and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>. These works enabled <a href="../cathen/15349a.htm">Vercellone</a> to write: "To the Dominican Order belongs the glory of having first renewed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the illustrious example of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> and St. Augustine by the ardent cultivation of sacred criticism" (P. Mandonnet "Tr&agrave;vaux des Dominicains sur les Saintes Ecritures" in "Dict. de la Bible", II, col. 1463; Saul, "Des Bibelstudium im Predigerorden" in "Der Katholik", 82 Jahrg, 3 f., XXVII, 1902, a repetition of the foregoing article).

<p>(ii) Philosophical works. &#151; The most celebrated <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> works of the thirteenth century were those of <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a> and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>. The former compiled on the model of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> a vast scientific encyclopedia which exercised great influence on the last centuries of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> ("Alberti Magni Opera", Lyons, 1651, 20 vols. in fol.; Paris, 1890, 38 vols. in 40; Mandonnet, "Siger de Brabant", I, 37, n. 3). <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a>, apart from special treatises and numerous <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> sections in his other works, commentated in whole or in part thirteen of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> treatises, these being the most important of the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Stagyrite's</a> works (Mandonnet, "Des &eacute;crits authentiques de St. Thomas d'Aquin", 2nd ed., p. 104, Opera, Paris, 1889, XXII-XVI). <a href="../cathen/08644a.htm">Robert of Kilwardby</a> (d. 1279) a holder of the old Augustinian direction, produced numerous <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> writings. His "De ortu et divisione philosophiae" is regarded as "the most important introduction to Philosophy of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>" (Baur "Dominicus Gundissalinus De divisione philosophiae", M&uuml;nster, 1903, 368). At the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth century, Dietrich of Vriberg left an important <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and scientific work (Krebs, "Meister Dietrich, sein Leben, seine Werke, seine Wissenschaft", M&uuml;nster, 1906). At the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth century the Dominicans composed numerous <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> treatises, many of them bearing on the special points whereon the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic School</a> was attacked by its adversaries ("Archiv f. Litt. und Kirchengesch.", II, 226 sqq.).

<p>(iii) Theological works. &#151; In importance and number <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works occupy the foreground in the literary activity of the order. Most of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> composed commentaries on the "Sentences" of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, which was the classical text in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Besides the "Sentences" the usual work of bachelors in the Universities included <em>Disputationes </em>and <em>Quodlibeta, </em>which were always the writings of masters. The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <em>summae </em>set forth the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> matter according to a more complete and well-ordered plan than that of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> and especially with solid <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> principles in which the books of the "Sentences" were wanting. Manuals of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and more especially manuals, or <em>summae, </em>on penance for the use of confessors were composed in great numbers. The oldest Dominican commentaries on the "Sentences" are those of Roland of <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, <a href="../cathen/07521b.htm">Hugh of Saint Cher</a>, Richard Fitzacre, <a href="../cathen/08644a.htm">Robert of Kilwardby</a> and <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a>. The series begins with the year 1230 if not earlier and the last are prior to the middle of the thirteenth century (Mandonnet, "Siger de Brabant", I, 53). The <a href="../summa/index.html">"Summa"</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (1265-75) is still the masterpiece of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The monumental work of <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a> is unfinished. The "Summa de bono" of Ulrich of Strasburg (d. 1277), a disciple of Albert is still unedited, but is of paramount interest to the historian of the thought of the thirteenth century (Grabmann, "Studien ueber Ulrich von Strassburg" in "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Kathol. Theol.", XXIX, 1905, 82). The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> summa of <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a> is highly esteemed by <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moralists</a> and economists (Ilgner, "Die Volkswirtschaftlichen Anschaungen Antonins von Florenz", Paderborn, 1904). The "Compendium theologic&aelig; veritatis" of Hugh Ripelin of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> (d. 1268) is the most widespread and famous manual of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> (Mandonnet, "Des &eacute;crits authentiques de St. Thomas", Fribourg, 1910, p. 86). The chief manual of confessors is that of Paul of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> composed for the Brothers of St. Nicholas of Bologna (1220-21) and edited without mention of the author in the "Bibliotheca Casinensis" (IV, 1880, 191) and with <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> assignment of authorship by R. Duellius, "Miscellan. Lib." (Augsburg, 1723, 59). The "Summade Poenitentia" of Raymond of Pennafort, composed in 1235, was a classic during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and was one of the works of which the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were most multiplied. The "Summa Confessorum" of John of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> (d. 1314) is, according to F. von Schulte, the most perfect product of this class of literature. The Pisan Bartolommeo of San Concordio has left us a "Summa Casuum" composed in 1338, in which the matter is arranged in alphabetical order. It was very successful in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The manuals for confessors of John Nieder (d. 1438), <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a> (d. 1459), and <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Girolamo Savonarola</a> (d. 1498) were much esteemed in their time (Qu&eacute;tif-Echard, "Script. Ord. Praed.", I, <em>passim</em>; <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a>, "Nomenclator literarius; aetas media", Innsbruck, 1906, <em>passim; </em>F. von Schulte, "Gesch. der Quellen und Literatur des canonischen Rechts", Stuttgart, II, 1877, p. 410 sqq.; Dietterle, "Die Summ&aelig; confessorum . . . von ihren Anf&auml;ngen an bis zu Silvester Prierias" in "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Kirchengesch.", XXIV, 1903; XXVIII, 1907).

<p>(iv) Apologetic works. &#151; The Preachers, born amid the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensian heresy</a> and founded especially for the defense of the Faith, bent their literary efforts to reach all classes of dissenters from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. They produced by far the most powerful works in the sphere of <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a>. The "Summa contra Catharos et Valdenses" (Rome, 1743) of <a href="../cathen/10479a.htm">Moneta of Cremona</a>, in course of composition in 1244, is the most complete and solid work produced in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Cathari</a> and <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldenses</a>. The "Summa contra Gentiles" of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> is one of that master's strongest creations. It is the defense of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> against Arabian philosophy. Raymond Marti in his "Pugio fidei", in course of composition in 1278 (Paris, 1642; 1651: Leipzig, 1687), measures arms with <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>. This work, to a large extent based on Rabbinic literature, is the most important <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> monument of Orientalism (Neubauer, "Jewish Controversy and the Pugio Fidei" in "The Expositor", 1888, p. 81 sqq.; Loeb, "La controverse religieuse entre les chr&eacute;tiens et les Juifs au moyen-&acirc;ge en France et en Espagne" in "Revue de l'histoire des religions", XVIII, 136). The Florentine, <a href="../cathen/13052a.htm">Riccoldo di Monte Croce</a>, a missionary in the East (d. 1320), composed his "Propugnaculum Fidei" against the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08692a.htm">Koran</a>. It is a rare <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Latin work based directly on Arabian literature. Demetrius Cydonius translated the "Propugnaculum" into Greek in the fourteenth century and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> translated it into German in the sixteenth (Mandonnet, "Fra Riccoldo di Monte Croce, p&eacute;lerin en Terre Sainte et missionnaire en Orient" in "Revue Biblique", I, 1893, 44; Grabmann, "Die Missionsidee bei den Dominikanertheologien des 13. Jahrhunderts" in "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Missionswissenschaft", I, 1911, 137).

<p>(v) Educational literature. &#151; Besides manuals of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> the Dominicans furnished a considerable literary output with a view to meeting the various needs of all social classes and which may be called <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> or practical literature. They composed treatises on preaching, models or materials for sermons, and collections of discourses. Among the oldest of these are the "Distinctiones" and the "Dictionarius pauperum" of Nicholas of Biard (d. 1261), the "Tractatus de diversis materiis pr&aelig;dicabilibus" of <a href="../cathen/14291a.htm">Stephen of Bourbon</a> (d. 1261), the "De eruditione pr&aelig;dicatorum" of <a href="../cathen/07542a.htm">Humbert of Romans</a> (d. 1277), the "Distinctiones" of <a href="../cathen/11062b.htm">Nicholas of Goran</a> (d. 1295), and of Maurice of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> [d. circa 1300; (Qu&eacute;tif-Echard, "Script. Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", II, 968; 970; Lecoy de la Marche, "La chaire fran&ccedil;aise au moyen &acirc;ge", Paris, 1886; Crane, "The <em>exempla </em>or illustrative stories from the 'Sermones vulgares' of Jacquesde Vitry", London, 1890)]. The Preachers led the way in the composition of comprehensive collections of the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> or legendaries, writings at once for the use and edification of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Bartholomew of Trent compiled his "Liber epilogorum in Gesta Sanctorum" in 1240. After the middle of the thirteenth century Roderick of Cerrate composed a collection of "Vit&aelig; Sanctorum" (Madrid University Library, cod. 146). The "Abbreviatio in gestis et miraculis sanctorum", composed in 1243 according to the "Speculum historiale" of <a href="../cathen/15439a.htm">Vincent of Beauvais</a>, is the work of Jean de Mailly. The "Legenda Sanctorum" of <a href="../cathen/08262b.htm">Jacopo de Voragine (Vorazze)</a> called also the "Golden Legend", written about 1260, is universally known. "The success of the book," writes the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandist</a>, A. Poncelet, "was prodigious; it far exceeded that of all similar compilations." It was besides translated into all the vernaculars of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The "Speculum Sanctorale" of Bernard Guidonis is a work of a much more scholarly character. The first three parts were finished in 1324 and the fourth in 1329. About the same time Peter Calo (d. 1348) undertook under the title of "Legenda sanctorum" an "immense compilation" which aimed at being more complete than its predecessors (A. Poncelet, "Le l&eacute;gendier de Pierre Calo" in "Analecta Bollandiana", XXIX, 1910, 5-116).

<p>Catechetical literature was also early taken in hand. In 1256-7 Raymond Marti composed his "Explanatio symboli ad institutionem fidelium" ("Revue des Biblioth&egrave;ques", VI, 1846, 32; March, "La 'Explanatio Symboli', obra inedita de Ramon Marti, autor del 'Pugio Fidei'", in "Anuari des Institut d'Estudis Catalans", 1908, and Barcelona, 1910). <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a> wrote four small treatises which represent the contents of a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> as it was in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>: "De articulis fidei et Ecclesiae Sacramentis"; "Expositio symboli Apostolorum"; "De decem pr&aelig;ceptis et lege amoris"; "Expositio orationis dominicae". Several of these writings have been collected and called the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. (Portmann-Kunz, "Katechismus des hl. Thomas von Aquin", <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, 1900.) In 1277 Laurent d'Orl&eacute;ans composed at the request of Philip the Bold, whose confessor he was, a real <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> in the vernacular known as the "Somme le Roi" (Mandonnet, "Laurent d'Orl&eacute;ans l'auteur de la Somme le Roi" in "Revue des langues romanes", 1911; "Dict. de th&eacute;ol. cath.", II, 1900). At the beginning of the fourteenth century Bernard Guidonis composed an abridgment of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> which he revised later when he had become <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lod&egrave;ve (1324-31) into a sort of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> for the use of his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in the instruction of the faithful ("Notices et extraits de la Bib. Nat.", XXVII, Paris, 1879, 2nd part, p. 362, C. Douais, "Un nouvel &eacute;crit de Bernard Gui. Le synodal de Lod&egrave;ve, "Paris, 1944 p. vii). The "Discipulus" of John H&eacute;rolt was much esteemed in its day (Paulus, "Johann H&eacute;rolt und seine Lehre. Ein Beitrag zur Gesch. des religiosen Volksunterichte am Ausgang des Mittelalters" in "Zeitsch. f&uuml;r kath. Theol.", XXVI, 1902, 417).

<p>The order also produced pedagogical works. William of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> composed a treatise "De Modo docendi pueros" (Paris, Bib. Nat. lat. 16435) which the General Chapter of 1264 recommended, as well as one on preaching and confession for <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> children. ("Act. Cap. Gen." I, 125; "Script. Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", I, 345). <a href="../cathen/15439a.htm">Vincent of Beauvais</a> wrote especially for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of princes. He first composed his "De eruditione filiorum regalium" (Basle, 1481), then the "De eruditione principum", published with the works of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, to whom as well as to Guillaume Perrault it has been incorrectly ascribed; finally (c. 1260) the "Tractatus de morali principis institutione", which is a general treatise and is still unedited ("Script. Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", I, 239; R. Friedrich, "Vincentius von Beauvais als P&auml;dagog nach seiner Schrift De eruditione filiorum regalium", Leipzig, 1883). Early in the fifteenth century (1405) John Dominici composed his famous "Lucula noctis", in which he deals with the study of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> authors in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> youth. This is a most important work, written against the dangers of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> ("B. Johannis Dominici Cardinalis S. Sixti Lucula Noctis", ed. R. Coulon, Paris, 1908). Dominici is also the author of a much esteemed work on the government of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> ("Regola del governo di cure familiare dal Beato Giovanni Dominici", ed. D. Salve, Florence, 1860). <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a> composed a "Regola a ben vivere" (ed. Palermo, Florence, 1858). Works on the government of countries were also produced by members of the order; among them are the treatises of St. Thomas "De rege et regno", addressed to the King of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> (finished by Bartolommeo of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>), and the "De regimine subditorum", composed for the Countess of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>. At the request of the Florentine Government <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Girolamo Savonarola</a> drew up (1493) his "Trattati circa il reggimento e governo della citt&aacute; di Firenze" (ed. Audin de Rians, Florence, 1847) in which he shows great political insight.

<p>(vi) Canon law. &#151; St. Raymond of Pennafort was chosen by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> to compile the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> (1230-34); to his credit also belong opinions and other works on canon law. <a href="../cathen/09733a.htm">Martin of Troppau</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>, composed (1278) a "Tabula decreti" commonly called "Margarita Martiniana", which received wide circulation. Martin of <a href="../cathen/05785a.htm">Fano</a>, professor of canon law at <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a> and <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a> and podeat&agrave; of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> in 1260-2, prior to entering the order, wrote valuable canonical works. Nicholas of Ennezat at the beginning of the fourteenth century composed tables on various parts of canon law. During the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> John Dominici wrote copious memoranda in defense of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the legitimate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the two most important being still unedited (Vienna, Hof-bibliothek, lat. 5102, fol. 1-24). About the middle of the fifteenth century John of Torquemada wrote extensive works on the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> of Gratian which were very influential in defense of the pontifical <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Important works on inquisitorial law also emanated from the order, the first directories for trial of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> being composed by Dominicans. The oldest is the opinion of St. Raymond of Pennafort [1235 (ed. in Bzovius, "Annal. eccles." ad ann. 1235 "Monum. Ord. Pr&aelig;d. Hist.", IV, fasc. II, 41; "Le Moyen Age", 2nd series III, 305)]. The same canonist wrote (1242) a directory for the inquisitions of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> (C. Douais, "L'Inquisition", Paris, I, 1906, p. 275). About 1244 another directory was composed by the inquisitors of Provence ("Nouvelle revue historique du droit fran&ccedil;ais et &eacute;tranger", Paris, 1883, 670; E. Vacandard, "L'Inquisition", Paris, 1907, p. 314). But the two classical works of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> on inquisitorial law are that of Bernard Guidonis composed in 1321 under the title of "Directorium Inquisitionis hereticae pravitatis" (ed. C. Douais <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1886) and the "Directorium Inquisitorum" of <a href="../cathen/05735c.htm">Nicholas Eymerich</a> [(1399) "Archiv f&uuml;r Literatur und Kirchengeschechte"; Grahit, "El inquisidor F. Nicholas Eymerich", Girona, 1878; Schulte, "Die Gesch. der Quellen und Literatur des Canonischen Rechts", II, <em>passim</em>].

<p>(vii) Historical Writings. &#151; The activity of the Preachers in the domain of history was considerable during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. Some of their chief works incline to be real general histories which assured them great success in their day. The "Speculum Historiale" of <a href="../cathen/15439a.htm">Vincent of Beauvais</a> (d. circa 1264) is chiefly, like the other parts of the work, of the nature of a documentary compilation, but he has preserved for us sources which we could never otherwise reach (E. Boutarie, "Examen des sources du Speculum historiale de Vincent de Beauvais", Paris, 1863). Martin the Pole, called <a href="../cathen/09733a.htm">Martin of Troppau</a> (d. 1279), in the third quarter of the thirteenth century composed his chronicles of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and emperors which were widely circulated and had many continuators ("Mon. Germ. Hist.: Script.", XXII). The anonymous chronicles of Colmar in the second half of the thirteenth century have left us valuable historical materials which constitute a sort of history of contemporary civilization (Mon. Germ. Hist.: Script., XVII). The chronicle of <a href="../cathen/08262b.htm">Jacopo da Voragine</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> (d. 1298) is much esteemed ("Rer. Ital. Script."; Mannucci, "La Cronaca di Jacopo da Voragine", Genoa, 1904). Ptolemy of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a> and Bernard Guidonis are the two great ecclesiastical historians of the early fourteenth century. The "Historia ecclesiastica nova" of the former and the "Flores cronicorum seu cathalogus pontificum romanorum" of the latter contain valuable historical information.

<p>But the historical activity of Bernard Guidonis far exceeded that of Ptolemy and his contemporaries; he is the author of twenty historical publications, several of which, such as his historical compilation on the Order of Preachers, are very important in value and extent. Bernard Guidonis is the first <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> historian who had a wide sense of historical documentation ("Rer. Ital. Script.", XI K. Kr&uuml;ger, "Des Ptolem&auml;us Lucensis Leben und Werke", G&ouml;ttingen, 1874; D. K&ouml;nig, "Ptolemaus von Lucca und die Flores Chronicorum des B. Guidonis", <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a>, 1875, Idem, "Tolomeo von Lucca", Harburg, 1878; Delisle, "Notice sur les manuscrits de Bernard Gui" in "Notices et manuscrits de la Bib. Nat.", XVII, pt. II, 169-455; Douais, "Un nouveau manuscrit de Bernard Gui et de ses chroniques des papes d'Avignon" in "M&eacute;m. soc. Arch&eacute;ol. Midi", XIV, 1889, p. 417, Paris, 1889; Arbellot, "Etude biographique et bibliographique sur Bernard Guidonis", Paris-Limoges, 1896). The fourteenth century beheld a galaxy of Dominican historians, the chief of whom were: Francesco Pipini of Bologna (d. 1320), the Latin translator of <a href="../cathen/12217a.htm">Marco Polo</a> and the author of a "Chronicon" which began with the history of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> (L. Manzoni, "Di frate Francesco Pipini da Bologna, storico, geografo, viaggiatore del sec. XIV", Bologna, 1896); Nicholas of Butrinto (1313), author of the "Relatio de Henrici VII imperatoris itinere italico" (ed. Heyck, Innsbruck, 1888); <a href="../cathen/15063b.htm">Nicholas Trevet</a>, compiler of the "Annales sex regum Angli&aelig;" (ed. T. Hog, London, 1845); Jacopo of <a href="../cathen/01110a.htm">Acqui</a> and his "Chronicon imaginis mundi" [(1330); Monumenta histori&aelig; patri&aelig;, script." III, Turin, 1848]; Galvano Fiamma (d. circa 1340) composed various works on the history of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (Ferrari, "Le cronache di Galvano Flamma e le fonti della Galvagnana" in "Bulletino dell' Istituto Storico Italiano", Rome, 1891); John of Colonna (c. 1336) is the author of a "De viris illustribus" and a "Mare Historiarum" (Mandonnet, "Des &eacute;crits authentiques de St. Thomas d'Aquin", Fribourg, 2nd ed., 1910, p. 97). In the second half of the fourteenth century Conrad of Halberstadt wrote a "Chronographia summorum Pontificum et Imperatorum romanorum (Merck, "Die Chronographia Konrads von Halberstadt" etc. in "Forsch. deutsch. Gesch." XX, 1880, 279); <a href="../cathen/07235c.htm">Henry of Hervordia</a> (d. 1370) wrote a "Liber de rebus memorabilibus" (ed. Potthast, G&ouml;ttingen, 1859); Stefanardo de Vicomercato is the author of the rhythmical poem "De gestis in civitate Mediolani" (in "Script. Rer. Ital.", IX; G. Calligaris, "Alcune osservazioni sopra un passo del poema 'De gestis in civitate Mediolani' di Stefanardo" in "Misc. Ceriani", Milan, 1910). At the end of the fifteenth century Hermann of Lerbeke composed a "Chronicon comitum Schauenburgensium" and a "Chronicon episcoporum Mindensium" (Eckmann, "Hermann von Lerbeke mit besonderer Ber&uuml;cksichtigung seines Lebens und der Abfassungszeit seiner Schriften" (Hamm, 1879); Hermann Korner left an important "Chronica novella" (ed. J. Schwalm, G&ouml;ttingen 1895; cf. Waitz, "Ueber Hermann Korner und die L&uuml;becker Chronikon", G&ouml;ttingen, 1851). The "Chronicon" or "Summa Historialis" of <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, composed about the middle of the fifteenth century is a useful compilation with original data for the author's own times (Schaube, "Die Quellen der Weltchronik des heil. Antonin Erzbischofs von Florenz" Hirschberg, 1880). Felix Fabri (Schmid, d. 1502) left valuable historical works; his "Evagatorium in Terr&aelig; Sanct&aelig;, Arabi&aelig; et Aegypti peregrinationem" (ed., Hassler, Stuttgart, 1843) is the most instructive and important work of this kind during the fourteenth century. He is also the author of a "Descriptio Suevi&aelig;" ("Quellen zer Schweizer Gesch.", Basle, 1884) and a "Tractatus de civitate Ulmensi" (Litterarischesverein in Stuttgart, no. 186, T&uuml;bingen, 1889, ed. G. Veesenmeyer; cf., under the names of these writers, Qu&eacute;tif-Echard, "Script. Ord. Pr&aelig;d", Chevalier, "R&eacute;pertoire . . . du moyen-&acirc;ge; Bio-Bibl.", Paris, 1907, Potthast "Bib. Hist. Medii &AElig;vi", <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1896; <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a>, "Nomenclator Lit.", II, 1906).

<p>(viii) Miscellaneous works. &#151; Being unable to devote a section to each of the different spheres wherein the Preachers exercised their activity, we shall mention here some works which obtained considerable influence or are particularly worthy of attention The "Specula" ("Naturale", "doctrinale", "historiale"; the "Speculum morale" is <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>) of <a href="../cathen/15439a.htm">Vincent of Beauvais</a> constitute the largest encyclopedia of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and furnished materials for many subsequent writers (Vogel, "Literar-historischen Notizen &uuml;ber den mittelalterlichen Gelehrten Vincenz von Beauvais", Freiburg, 1843; Bourgeat, "Etudes sur Vincent de Beauvais", Paris, 1856). The work of <a href="../cathen/07542a.htm">Humbert of Romans</a>, "De tractandis in concilio generali", composed in 1273 at the request of <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> and which served as a programme to the General Council of Lyons in 1274, contains the most remarkable views on the condition of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and the reforms to be undertaken (Mortier, "Hist. des Ma&icirc;tres g&eacute;n&eacute;raux de l'ordre des Fr&egrave;res Pr&ecirc;cheurs", I, 88). The treatise is edited in full only in Brown "Appendix ad fasc. rerum expectandarum et fugendarum" (London, 1690, p. 185). Burchard of Mount Sion with his "Descriptio Terr&aelig; Sanctae" written about 1283, became the classic geographer of Palestine during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> (J. C. M. Laurent, "Peregrinatores medii &aelig;vi quatuor", Leipsig, 1873). <a href="../cathen/15634a.htm">William of Moerbeke</a>, who died as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> about 1286, was the revisor of translations of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> from the Greek and the translator of portions not hitherto translated. To him are also due translations of numerous <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and scientific works of ancient Greek authors (Mandonnet, "Siger de Brabant", I, 40). The "Catholicon" of the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> John Balbus, completed in 1285, is a vast treatise on the Latin tongue, accompanied by an etymological vocabulary. It is the first work on profane <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> ever printed. It is also famous because in the <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> edition (1460) John Guttenberg first made use of movable type ("Incunabula xylographica et typographica", 1455-1500, Joseph Baer Frankfort, 1900, p. 11). The "Philobiblion" edited under the name of <a href="../cathen/13042b.htm">Richard of Bury</a>, but composed by Robert Holcot (d. 1349), is the first <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> treatise on the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of books (ed. Cocheris, Paris, 1856; tr. Thomas, London, 1888). John of Tambach (d. 1372), first professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the newly-founded <a href="../cathen/12342a.htm">University of Prague</a> (1347), is the author of a valuable work, the "Consolatio Theologi&aelig;" (<a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, "Magister Johann von Dambach" in "Archiv f&uuml;r Litt. u. Kirchengesch" III, 640). Towards the end of the fifteenth century Frederico Frezzi, who died as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06124b.htm">Foligno</a> (1416), composed in Italian a poem in the spirit of the "Divine Commedia" and entitled "Il Quadriregio" (Foligno, 1725); (cf. Canetti, "Il Quadriregio", <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1889; Filippini, "Le edizioni del Quadriregio" in "Bibliofilia", VIII, Florence, 1907). The Florentine Thomas Sardi (d. 1517) wrote a long and valued poem, "L'anima peregrina", the composition of which dates from the end of the fifteenth century (Romagnoli "Frate Tommaso Sardi e il suo poema inedito dell' anima peregrine" in "Il propugnatore", XVIII, 1885, pt. II, 289).

<p>(ix) Liturgy. &#151; Towards the middle of the thirteenth century the Dominicans had definitely established the liturgy which they still retain. The final correction (1256) was the work of <a href="../cathen/07542a.htm">Humbert of Romans</a>. It was divided into fourteen sections or volumes. The prototype of this monumental work is preserved at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the general archives of the order ("Script. Ord. Pr&aelig;d." I, 143; "Zeitschr. f. Kathol. Theol.", VII, 10). A portable copy for the use of the master general, a beautiful specimen of thirteenth-century book-making, is preserved in the British Museum, no. 23,935 (J. W. Legg, "Tracts on the Mass", Bradshaw Society, 1904; Barge, "Le Chant liturgique dans 1'Ordre de Saint-Dominique" in "L'Ann&eacute;e Dominicaine", Paris, 1908, 27; Gagin, "Un manuscrit liturgique des Fr&egrave;res Pr&ecirc;cheurs ant&eacute;rieur aux r&eacute;glements d Humbert de Romans" in "Revue des Biblioth&egrave;ques", 1899, p. 163; Idem, "Dominicains et Teutoniques, conflit d'attribution du 'Liber Choralis'" no. 182 du catalogue 120 de M. Ludwig Rosenthal" in "Revue des Biblioth&egrave;ques", 1908). Jerome of Moravia, about 1250, composed a "Tractatus de Musica" (Paris, Bib. Nat. lat. 16,663), the most important theoretical work of the thirteenth century on <a href="../cathen/09304a.htm">liturgical chant</a>, some fragments of which were placed as preface to the Dominican liturgy of <a href="../cathen/07542a.htm">Humbert of Romans</a>. It was edited by <a href="../cathen/04453b.htm">Coussemaker</a> in his "Scriptores de musica medii &aelig;vi", I (Paris, 1864). (Cf. Kornm&uuml;ller "Die alten Musiktheoretiker XX. Hieronymus von M&auml;ren" in "Kirchenmusikalisehes Jahrbuch", IV, 1889, 14.) The Preachers also left numerous <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> compositions, among the most renowned being the Office of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, one of the masterpieces of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> liturgy (Mandonnet, "Des &eacute;crits authentiques de S. Thomas d'Aquin", 2nd ed. p. 127). Armand du Prat (d. 1306) is the author of the beautiful Office of St. Louis, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. His work, selected by the Court of Philip the Bold, came into universal use in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> ("Script. Ord. Pr&aelig;d." I, 499; "Notices et extraits des manuscrits de la Bib. Nat.", XXVII, 11th pt., 369, n. 6). The "Dies Ir&aelig;" has been attributed to Cardinal Latino Malabranca who was in his time a famous composer of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> chants and offices ("Scritti vari di Filologia", Rome, 1901, p. 488).

<p>(x) Humanistic works. &#151; The order felt more than is commonly thought the influence of <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> and furnished it with noteworthy contributions. This influence was continued during the following period in the sixteenth century and reacted on its Biblical and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> compositions. Leonardo Giustiniani, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10407a.htm">Mytilene</a>, in 1449, composed against the celebrated Poggio a treatise "De vera nobilitate", edited with Poggio's "De nobilitate" (Avellino, 1657). The <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> Thomas Schifaldo wrote commentaries on Perseus about 1461 and on Horace in 1476. He is the author of a "De viris illustribus Ordinis Pr&aelig;dicatorum", written in <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> style, and of the Office of <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a>, usually but incorrectly ascribed to <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> (Cozzuli "Tommaso Schifaldo umanista siciliano del sec. XV", <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, 1897, in "Documenti per servire alla storia di Sicilia", VI). The <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> Francesco Colonna is the author of the celebrated work "The Dream of Poliphilus" ("Poliphili Hypnerotomachia, ubi humane omnia non nisi somnium esse docet", Aldus, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1499; cf. Popelin, "Le songe de Poliphile ou hypnerotomachia de Fr&egrave;re Francesco Colonna", Paris, 1880). Colonna's work aims to condense in the form of a romance all the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of antiquity. It gives evidence of its author's profound classical learning and impassioned <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for Gr&aelig;co-Roman culture. The work, which is accompanied by the most perfect illustrations of the time, has been called "the most beautiful book of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>" (Ilg, "Ueber den kunsthistorisches werth der Hypnerotomachia Poliphili", <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1872; Ephrusi, "Etudes sur le songede Poliphile" in "Bulletin de Bibliophile" 1887, Paris, 1888; Dorez, "Des origines et de la diffusion du songede Poliphile" in "Revue des Biblioth&egrave;ques", VI, 1896, 239; Gnoli "Il sogno di Polifilo, in "Bibliofila", 1900, 190; Fabrini, "Indagini sul Polifilo" in "Giorn. Storico della letteratura Italiana", XXXV, 1900, I; Poppelreuter, "Der anonyme Meister des Polifilo" in "Zur Kunstgesch. des Auslandes", XX, Strassburg, 1904; Molmenti, "Alcuni documenti concernenti l'autore della (Hypnerotomachia Poliphili)" in "Archivio storico italiano", Ser. V, XXXVIII (906, 291). Tommaso Radini Todeschi (Radinus Todischus) composed under the title "Callipsychia" (Milan, 1511) an allegorical romance in the manner of Apuleius and inspired by the Dream of Poliphilus. The Dalmatian, John Polycarpus Severitanus of <a href="../cathen/13668d.htm">Sebenico</a>, commentated the eight parts of the discourse of Donatus and the Ethics of Seneca the Younger (Perugia, 1517; Milan, 1520; Venice, 1522) and composed "Gramatices historic&aelig;, methodic&aelig; et exegetic&aelig;" (Perugia, 1518). The Bolognese Leandro Alberti (d. 1550) was an elegant Latinist and his "De viris illustribus ordinis praedicatorum" (Bologna, 1517), written in the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> manner, is a beautiful specimen of Bolognese publishing ("Script. Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", II, 137; Campori, "Sei lettere inedite di Fra Leandro Alberti" in "Atti e memorie della Deput. di Storia patria per le prov. Modenesi e Parmensi", I, 1864, p. 413). Finally <a href="../cathen/02246c.htm">Matteo Bandello</a> (d. 1555), who was called the "Dominican <a href="../cathen/02607a.htm">Boccacio</a>", is regarded as the first novelist of the Italian Cinquecento and his work shows what an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> influence the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> could exert on <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a> (Masi "Matteo Bandello o vita italiana in un novelliere del cinquecento", Bologna, 1900).

<p><em>(g) The Preachers and Art</em>

<p>The Preachers hold an important place in the history of art. They contributed in many ways to the artistic life of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. Their churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> offered an extraordinary field of activity to contemporary artists, while a large number of the Preachers themselves did important work in the various spheres of art. Finally by their teaching and religious activity they often exercised a profound influence on the direction and inspiration of art. Primarily established under a regime of evangelic poverty, the order took severe measures to avoid in its <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> all that might suggest luxury and wealth. Until the middle of the thirteenth century its constitutions and general chapters energetically legislated against anything tending to suppress the evidence of poverty ("Archiv. f. Litt.-und Kirchgesch.", I, 225, "Acta Cap. Gen.", I, <em>passim</em>). But the order's intense activity, its establishment in large cities and familiar contact with the whole general movement of civilization triumphed over this state of things. As early as 1250, churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> appeared called <em>opus sumptuosum </em>(Finke, "Die Freiburger Dominikaner und der M&uuml;nsterbau", Freiburg, 1901 p. 47; Potthast, op. cit., 22,426). They were, however, encouraged by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority and the order eventually relinquished its early uncompromising attitude. Nevertheless ascetic and morose minds were <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a> by what they called royal edifices (Matthew <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, "Hist. maj.", ad. ann. 1243; d'Ach&eacute;ry, "Spicelegium", Paris, 1723, II, 634; Cocheris "Philobiblion", Paris, 1856, p. 227). The second half of the thirteenth century saw the beginning of a series of monuments, many of which are still famous in history and art." The Dominicans," says Cesare Cant&ugrave;, "soon had in the chief towns of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> magnificent <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and superb <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, veritable wonders of art. Among others may be mentioned: the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Novella, at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>; Santa Maria Sopra Minerva, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; St. John and St. Paul, at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>; St. Nicholas, at <a href="../cathen/15038a.htm">Treviso</a>; St. Dominic, at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, at <a href="../cathen/12117a.htm">Prato</a>, and at Bologna, with the splendid <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the founder, St. Catherine, at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>; St. Eustorgius and Sta Maria delle Grazie, at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and several others remarkable for a rich simplicity and of which the architects were mostly <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>" ("Les H&eacute;r&eacute;tiques de l'Italie", Paris, 1869, I, 165; Berthier, "L'&eacute;glise de Sainte Sabine &agrave; Rome", Rome, 1910; Mullooly, "St. Clement, Pope and Martyr, and his Basilica in Rome", Rome, 1873; Nolan, "The Basilica of St. Clement in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>" <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1910; Brown, "The Dominican Church of Santa Maria Novelli at Florence, An historical, architectural and artistic study", <a href="../cathen/05284a.htm">Edinburgh</a>, 1902; Berthier, "L'&eacute;glise de la Minerve &agrave; <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>: 1910; Marchese, "San Marco convento dei Padri Predicatori in Firenze", <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1853; Malaguzzi, "La chiesa e il convento di S.

Domenico di Perugia", <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, 1798; Biebrach, "Die holzgedeckten Franziskaner und Dominikanerkirchen in Umbrien und Toskana", Berlin, 1908).

<p>France followed in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy's</a> footsteps. Here mention must be made of the Jacobins of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (Carri&egrave;re, "Les Jacobinsde Toulouse", 2nd ed., Toulouse, s. d.); St. Jacques de Paris (Millie, "Antiquit&eacute;s rationales", Paris, 1790, III, 1); St. Maximin in Provence (Rostan, "Notice sur l'&eacute;glise de Saint-Maximin", Brignoles, 1859); Notre-Dame-de-Confort at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> (Cormier, "L'ancien couvent des Dominicainsde Lyon", Lyons, 1898). A comprehensive account of the <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> work of the Dominicans in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> may be found in the magnificent publication of <a href="../cathen/13117b.htm">Rohault de Fleury</a>, "Gallia Dominicana, Les couvents de Saint-Dominique en France au moyen-&acirc;ge" (Paris, 1903, 2 vols. in 4). <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> was also covered with remarkable monuments: St. Catherine of Barcelona and St. Thomas of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> were destroyed by fire; S. Esteban at Salamanca, S. Pablo and S. Gregorio at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, Santo Tomas at <a href="../cathen/02160b.htm">Avila</a>, San Pablo at Seville and at <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a>. S. Cruz at <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a>, <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a> at Valencia and Saragossa (Martinez-Vigil, "La ordende Predicadores", Barcelona, 1886). <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> also had beautiful buildings. The church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Batalha are perhaps the most splendid ever dwelt in by the order (Murphy, "Plans, elevations, sections and views of the Church of Batalha", London, 1795; de Condeixa, "O mosteiro de Batalha em Portugal", Paris, 1892; Vascoucellos, "Batalha. Convento de Santa Maria da Victoria", Porto, 1905). <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> had beautiful churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, usually remarkable for their simplicity and the purity of their lines (Scherer, "Kirchen und Kloster der Franziskaner und Dominikaner in Thuringen", Jena, 1910; Schneider, "Die Kirchen der Dominikaner und Karmeliten" in "Mittelalterliche Ordensbauten in Mainz", Mainz, 1879; "Zur Wiederherstellung der Dominikanerkirche in Augsburg" in "Augsburger Postzeitung", 12 Nov., 1909; "Des Dominikanerkloster in Eisenach", Eisenach, 1857; Ingold, "Notice sur l'&eacute;glise et le couvent des Dominicainsde Colmar", Colmar, 1894; Burckhardt-Riggenbach, "Die Dominikaner Klosterkirche in Basel", Basle, 1855; Stammler, "Die ehemalige Predigerkirche in Bern und ihre Wandmalerein" in "Berner Kunstdenkmaler", III, Bern, 1908).

<p>Whatever may be said to the contrary the Dominicans as well as other <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> created a special <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> art. They made use of art as they found it in the course of their history and adapted it to their needs. They adopted Gothic art and assisted in its diffusion, but they accepted the art of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> when it had supplanted the ancient forms. Their churches varied in dimensions and richness, according to the exigencies of the place. They built a number of churches with double <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> and a larger number with open roofs. The distinct characteristic of their churches resulted from their sumptuary legislation which excluded decorated <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> work, save in the choir. Hence the predominance of single lines in their buildings. This exclusivism, which often went as far as the suppression of capitals on the columns, gives great lightness and elegance to the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> of their churches. While we lack direct information concerning most of the architects of these monuments, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that many of the men who supervised the construction of its <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> were members of the order and they even assisted in works of art outside of the order. Thus we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Brother Diemar built the Dominican church of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> (1273-77) (Sighart, "Gesch. d. bildenden K&uuml;nste im Kgn. Bayern", Munich, 1862). Brother Volmar exercised his activity in Alsace about the same time and especially at Colmar (Ingold, op. cit.). Brother Humbert was the architect of the church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Bonn, as well as of the stone bridge across the Aar, in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the most beautiful in the city (Howard, "Des Dominikaner-Kloster in Bern von 1269-1400", Bern, 1857). In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> architects of the order are known to fame, especially at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, where they erected the church and <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> of S. Maria Novella, which epitomize the whole history of Florentine art (Davidsohn, "Forschungen zur Gesch. von Florenz", <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1898, 466; Marchese, "Memorie dei pi&ugrave; insigni pittori, scultori e architetti domenicani", Bologna, 1878, I). At first the order endeavoured to banish <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> from its <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, but eventually accepted it and set the example by the construction of the beautiful <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Dominic at Bologna, and of <a href="../cathen/11773d.htm">St. Peter of Verona</a> at the Church of St. Eustorgius at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. A Dominican, William of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, worked on the former (Berthier, "Le tombeau de St. Dominique", Paris, 1895; Beltrani, "La cappella di S. Pietro Martire presso la Basilica di Sant Eustorgio in Milano" in "Archivio storico dell' arte", V, 1892). Brother Paschal of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> executed interesting sculptural works, e.g. his sphinx of <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, signed and dated (1286), and the paschal candlestick of Sta. Maria in Cosmedin, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> ("R&ouml;mische Quartalschrift", 1893, 29).

<p>There were many miniaturists and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> among the Preachers. As early as the thirteenth century Hugh Ripelin of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> (d. 1268) was renowned as a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> (Mon. Germ. Hist.: SS., XVII, 233). But the lengthy list is dominated by two masters who overshadow the others, <a href="../cathen/01483b.htm">Fra Angelico</a> and <a href="../cathen/02318a.htm">Fra Bartolommeo</a>. The work of Fra Giovanni Angelico da Fiesole (d. 1455) is regarded as the highest embodiment of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> inspiration in art (Marchese, "Memorie", I, 245; Tumi&agrave;ti, "Frate Angelico", <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1897; Supino "Beato Angelico", <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1898; Langton Douglas, "Fra Angelico", London, 1900; Wurm, "Meister und Sch&uuml;lerarbeit in Fra Angelicos Werk", <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, 1907; Cochin, "Le Bienheureux Fra Giovanni Angelico da Fiesole", Paris, 1906; Schottmuller, "Fra Angelico da Fiesole", Stuttgart and Leipzig, 1911 (Fr. ed., Paris, 1911). <a href="../cathen/02318a.htm">Fra Bartolommeo</a> belongs to the golden age of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. He is one of the great masters of drawing. His art is scholarly, noble and simple and imbued with a tranquil and restrained <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> (Marchese, "Memorie", II, 1; Franz, "Fra Bartolommeo della Porta", Ratisbon, 1879; Gruyer, "Fra Bartolommeo della Porta et Mariotto Albertinelli", Paris-London, s. d.; Knapp, "Fra Bartolommeo della Porta und die Schule von San Marco", Halle, 1903). The order also produced remarkable <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> on glass: James of Ulm (d. 1491), who worked chiefly at Bologna and William of Marcillat (d. 1529), who in the opinion of his first biographer was perhaps the greatest <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> on glass who ever lived (Marchese, "Memorie", II; Mancini, "Guglielmo de Marcillat francese insuperato pittore sul vetro", Florence, 1909). As early as the fourteenth century Dominican churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> began to be covered with mural decorations. Some of these edifices became famous sanctuaries of art, such as S. Maria Novella and S. Marco of Florence. But the phenomenon was general at the end of the fifteenth century, and thus the order received some of the works of the greatest artists, as for instance the "Last Supper" of <a href="../cathen/15440a.htm">Leonardo da Vinci</a> (1497-98) in the refectory of S. Maria delle Grazie at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (Bossi, "Del cenacolo di Leonardo da Vinci", <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 1910; Sant' Ambrogio, "Note epigrafiche ed artistiche intorno alla sale del Cenacolo ed al tempio di Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milano" in "Archivio Storico Lombardo", 1892).

<p>The Preachers exercised a marked influence on <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. The order infused its <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> learning into the objects of art under its control, thus creating what may be called <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. The decoration of the Campo Santo of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, <a href="../cathen/11275b.htm">Orcagna's</a> frescoes in the Strozzi <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at S. Maria Novella, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, have long been famous (Michel, "Hist. de l'art depuis les premiers temps chr&eacute;tiens jusqu'&agrave; nos jours", Paris, II, 1908; Hettner, "Die Dominikaner in der Kunstgesch. des 14. und 15. Jahrhunderts" in "Italienische Studien zur Gesch. der Renaissance", <a href="../cathen/03019a.htm">Brunswick</a>, 1879, 99; "Renaissance und Dominikaner Kunst" in "Hist.-polit. Blatter", LXXXXIII, 1884; Perate, "Un Triomphe de la Mort de Pietro Lorenzetti", Paris, 1902; Bacciochi, "Il chiostro verde e la cappella degli Spagnuoli", Florence; Endres, "Die Verherrlichung des Dominikanerordens in der Spanischen Kapelle an S. Maria Novella zu Florenz" in "Zeitschr. f. Christliche Kunst", 1909, p. 323). To the same causes were due the numerous triumphs of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> (Hettner, op. cit.; Berthier, "Le triomphe de Saint Thomas dans la chapelle des Espagnols &agrave; Florence", Fribourg, 1897; Ucelli, "Dell' iconografia di s. Tommaso d'Aquino", Naples, 1867). The influence of <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a> on the artists and the art of his time was profound (Gruyer, "Les illustrations des &eacute;crits de J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Savonarole et les paroles de Savonarole sur l'art", Paris, 1879; Lafenestre, "Saint Fran&ccedil;ois d' Assise et Savonarole inspirateurs de l'art Italien", Paris, 1911). The Dominicans also frequently furnished libretti, i.e. dogmatic or symbolic themes for works of art. They also opened up an important source of information to art with their <em>sanctoriaux </em>and their popularizing writings. Artistic works such as the dances of death and sybils allied with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are greatly indebted to them (Neale, "L'art religieux du XIIIe si&egrave;cle", Paris, 1910; Idem, "L'art religieux de la fin du moyen-&acirc;ge en France", Paris, 1910). Even the mystical life of the order, in its way, exercised an influence on contemporary art (Peltzer, "Deutsche Mystik und deutsche Kunst", Strassburg, 1899; Hintze, "Der Einfluss des mystiken auf die &auml;ltere K&ouml;lner Malerschule", Breslau, 1901). Its <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and its confraternities, especially that of the <a href="../cathen/13188b.htm">Rosary</a>, inspired many artists (Neuwbarn, "Die Verherrlichung des hl. Dominicus in der Kunst", 1906).

<p><em>(h) The Preachers and the Roman Church</em>

<p>The Order of Preachers is the work of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. She found in St. Dominic an instrument of the first rank. But it was she who inspired the establishment of the order, who loaded it with privileges, directed its general activity, and protected it against its adversaries. From <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> (1216) till the death of <a href="../cathen/07459a.htm">Honorius IV</a> (1287) the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> was most favourable to the Preachers. <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV's</a> change of attitude at the end of his pontificate (10 May, 1254), caused by the recriminations of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and perhaps also by the adhesion of Arnold of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> to <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II's</a> projects of anti-ecclesiastical reform, was speedily repaired by <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> [22 Dec., 1254; ("Chart Univ. Paris", I, 263, 276; <a href="../cathen/15650a.htm">Winckelmann</a>, "Fratris Arnoldi Ord. Pr&aelig;d. De correctione Ecclesiae Epistola", 1863; "Script. Ord. Praed.", II, 821 b)]. But as a general thing during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> remained much attached to the order, displaying great confidence in it, as is made manifest by the "Bullarium" of the Preachers. No other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, it would seem, ever received eulogies from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> like those addressed to it by <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a>, 23 May, 1257 (Potthast, op cit., 16,847). The order co-operated with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in every way, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> finding in its ranks assistants who were both competent and devoted. Beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> through its own activity, its preaching and in instruction, it was already a powerful agent of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>; nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> requested of it a universal co-operation. <a href="../cathen/11499a.htm">Matthew Paris</a> states in 1250: "The Friars Preachers, impelled by obedience, are the fiscal agents, the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a> and even the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. They are the faithful collectors of the pontifical money by their preaching and their <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a> and when they have finished they begin again. They assist the infirm, the dying, and those who make their wills. Diligent negotiators, armed with powers of every kind, they turn all to the profit of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>" (<a href="../cathen/11499a.htm">Matthew Paris</a>, "Hist. Angl.", III, 317, in "Rer. Brit. Med. &AElig;v. Script."). But the commissions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to the Preachers far exceeded those enumerated by <a href="../cathen/11499a.htm">Matthew Paris</a>, and among the weightiest must be mentioned the visitation of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, the administration of a large number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> and the inquisitorial office. The order attempted to withdraw from its multifarious occupations, which distracted it from its chief end. <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> partially yielded to their demands (25 Oct., 1239; cf. Potthast, op; cit., 10,804), but the order never succeeded in wholly winning its cause (Fontana, "Sacrum Theatrum Dominicanum" pt. II, De S. R. Ecclesiae Officialibus, Rome, 1666; "Bull. Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", I-II, <em>passim</em>; Potthast, "Regest. Pont. Rom.", Papal Register of the XIII cent. in "Bib. des Ecoles Fran&ccedil;aises d'Ath&egrave;nes et de <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>").

<p>The Dominicans gave to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> many noted personages: among them during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> were two <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/08018a.htm">Innocent V</a> (1276) and <a href="../cathen/02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a> [1303-4; (Mothon, "Vie du B. Innocent V", Rome, 1896; Fietta, "Nicol&ograve; Boccasino di Trevigi e il suo tempo", <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, 1875; Funk, "Papst Benedikt XI", M&uuml;nster, 1891; Grandjean; "Beno&icirc;t XI avant son pontificat" (1240-1303) in "M&eacute;langes archiv.-Hist. de L'&eacute;cole fran&ccedil;aisede Rome", VIII, 219; Idem, "Recherches sur l'administration financi&egrave;re du pape Beno&icirc;t XI", loc. cit., III, 1883, 47; Idem, "La date de la mort de Beno&icirc;t XI", loc. cit. XIV, 1894, 241; Idem, "Registre de Beno&icirc;t XI", Paris, 1885)].

<p>There were twenty-eight Dominican <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> during the first three centuries of the order's existence. Some of them were noted for exceptional services to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The earliest of them, <a href="../cathen/07521b.htm">Hugh of Saint Cher</a>, had the delicate mission of persuading <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> to accept William of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> after the deposition of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> (Sassen, "Hugh von St. Cher em Seine T&auml;tigkeit als Kardinal, 1244-1263", Bonn, 1908). Cardinal Latino Malabranca is famous for his legations and his pacification of Florence (1280; Davidsohn, "Gesch. von Florenz", II, <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1908, p. 152; Idem, "Forsch. zur Gesch von Florenz", IV, 1908, p. 226). Nicholas Albertini of <a href="../cathen/12117a.htm">Prato</a> (1305-21) also undertook the pacification of Florence (1304; Bandini, "Vita del Cardinale Nicolo da Prato", <a href="../cathen/09131a.htm">Leghorn</a>, 1757; Fineschi, "Supplemento alla vista del Cardinale Nicol&ograve; da Prato", <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, 1758; Perrens, "Hist.de Florence", Paris, III, 1877, 87). Cardinal Giovanni Dominici (1408-19) was the staunchest defender of the legitimate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>, at the end of the Great Schism; and in the name of his master resigned is the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> (Rossler, "Cardinal Johannes Dominici, O.Pr., 1357-1419", Freiburg, 1893; Mandonnet, "Beitr&auml;ge zur. Gesch. des Kardinals Giovanni Dominici" in "Hist. Jahrbuch.", 1900; Hollerbach, "Die Gregorianische le Partei, Sigismund und das Konstanzer Konzil" in. "R&ouml;mische Quartalschrift", XXIII-XXIV, 1909-10). Cardinal John de Torquemada (Turrecremata, 1439-68), an eminent <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, was one of the strongest defenders of the pontifical <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> at the time of the Council of Basle (Lederer, "Johann von Torquemada sein Leben und seine Schriften", Freiburg, 1879; Hefele, "Conciliengesch.", VIII)

<p>Many important officials were furnished to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: Masters of the Sacred Palace (Catalamus, "De magistro sacri palatii apostolici" <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1751); pontifical penitentiaries (Fontana, "Sacr. Theatr Dominic", 470; 631, "Bull. O. P.", VIII, 766, Poenitentiarii; Goller, "Die p&auml;pstliche Ponitentiarii vor ihrem Ursprung bis zu ihrer Umgestaltung unter Pius VII", Rome, 1907-11); and especially pontifical inquisitors. The defense of the Faith and the repression of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is essentially an apostolic and pontifical work. The Preachers also furnished many delegate judges holding their powers either from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but the order as such had no mission properly so called, and the legislation for the repression of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was in particular absolutely foreign to it. The extreme dangers run by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at the beginning of the thirteenth century owing to the progress of the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensians</a> and <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Cathari</a> impelled the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> to labour for their repression. It first urged the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to act, and the establishment of synodal witnesses was destined to make their mission more effective, but the insufficiency of their arrangement induced <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> to advise the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to make use of the Preachers and finally doubtless owing to the lack of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> displayed by many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to create inquisitorial judges by pontifical delegation. The Preachers were not chosen <em>de jure </em>but <em>de facto </em>and successively in the various provinces of the order. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> usually charged the Dominican <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a> with the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of inquisitorial officers whose <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> ordinarily coincided with the territory of the Dominican province. In their office the inquisitors were removed from the authority of their order and dependent only on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The first pontifical inquisitors were invariably chosen from the Order of Preachers, the reason being the scarcity of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. The Preachers, being vowed to study and preaching, were alone prepared for a ministry, which required both learning and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. The order received this like many other pontifical commissions, only with regret. The master general, <a href="../cathen/07542a.htm">Humbert of Romans</a> declared that the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> should flee all odious offices and especially the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> (Opera, ed. Berthier, II, 36)

<p>The same solicitude to remove the order from the odium of the inquisitorial office impelled the provincial chapter of <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a> (1244) to forbid that anything should accrue to the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> from the administration of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, that the order might not be <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a>. The provincial chapter of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> (1257) even forbade the religious to eat with the inquisitors in places where the order had a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> (Douais, "Les Fr&egrave;res Pr&ecirc;cheurs en Gascogne", Paris-Auch, 1885, p. 64). In countries where <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was powerful, for instance in the south of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the north of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the order had much to endure, pillage, temporary expulsion, and assassination of the inquisitors. After the putting to death of the inquisitors at Avignonet (28 May, 1242) and the assassination of <a href="../cathen/11773d.htm">St. Peter of Verona</a> (29 April, 1242) ("Vitae fratrum", ed. Reichart, 231; Perein, "Monumenta Conventus Tolosani", <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, 1693, II, 198, Acta SS., 29 April) the order, whose administration had much to suffer from this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, immediately requested to be relieved of the inquisitorial office. <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> refused (10 April, 1243; Potthast, 11,083), and the following year the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the south of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> petitioned the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> that he would retain the Preachers in the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> ("Hist. g&eacute;n. du Languedoc", III, ed. in folio, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> CCLIX, Vol. CCCCXLVI). Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> understood the desire of the Preachers; several provinces of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> ceased to be administered by them and were confided to the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> viz., the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>, Apulia, <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, the March of Trevisa and Slavonia, and finally Provence (Potthast, 11,993, 15,330, 15,409, 15,410, 18,895, 20,169; Tanon, "Hist. des tribunaux de l'Inquisition en <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>" <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1893; Idem, "Documents pour servir a l'hist. de l'Inquisition dans le Languedoc", Paris, 1900; Vacandard, "L'Inquisition", Paris, 1907; Lea, "Hist. of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>" New York-London, 1888, French tr., Paris, 1900; Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ricq, "Corpus documentorum Inquisitionis h&aelig;retic&aelig; pravitatis Neerlandic&aelig;", <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, 1900; Amabile, "Il santo officio della Inquizione in Napoli" Citt&agrave; di Castello, 1892; Canzons, "Hist. de l'Inquisition en France", Paris, 1909; Jordan, "La responsabilit&eacute; de l'&Eacute;glise dans la r&eacute;pression de l'h&eacute;r&eacute;sie au moyen-&acirc;ge" in "Annales de Philosophie chr&eacute;t.", CLIV, 1907, p. 225). The suppression of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which had been especially active in certain more affected parts of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, diminished notably in the second half of the thirteenth century. The particular conditions prevailing in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> brought about the reestablishment of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> with new <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> for the inquisitor general. These were exercised from 1483 to 1498 by Thomas of Torquemada, who reorganized the whole scheme of suppression, and by Diego de Deza from 1498 to 1507. These were the first and last Dominican inquisitors general in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (Lea, "Hist. of the Inquisition of Spain", New York, 1906, Cotarelo y Valledor, "Fray Diego de Deza", Madrid, 1905).

<p><em>(i) The Friars Preachers and the Secular Clergy</em>

<p>The Preachers, who had been constituted from the beginning as an order of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> vowed to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> with a view to supplementing the insufficiency of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a>, were universally accepted by the episcopate, which was unable to provide for the pastoral care of the faithful and the instruction of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. It was usually the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who summoned the Preachers to their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The conflicts which broke out here and there during the thirteenth century were not generally due to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> but to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who considered themselves injured in their temporal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> because of the devotion and generosity of the faithful towards the order. As a general thing compromises were reached between the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in which they were situated and peaceful results followed. The two great contests between the order and the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> broke out in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> during the thirteenth century. The first took place at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, led by William of Saint-Amour (1252-59), and was complicated by a scholastic question. The episcopate had no share in this, and the church supported with all its strength the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges of the order, which emerged victorious (Mandonnet, "Siger de Brabant", I, 70, 90; Perrod, "Etude sur la vie et les &oelig;uvres de Guillaume de Saint-Amour" in "M&eacute;moires de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'&eacute;mulation de Jura", Lons-le-Saunier, 1902, p. 61; Seppelt, "Der Kampf der Bettelorden an der Universit&auml;t <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in der Mitte des 13. Jahrhunderts" in "Kirchengeschichtliche Abhandlungen", <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, III, 1905; VII, 1909). The strife broke out anew in the north of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> after the privilege of <a href="../cathen/09724a.htm">Martin IV</a>, "Ad fructus uberes" (13 Dec., 1281), and lasted until the Council of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1290. It was to a large extent conducted by Guillaume de Flavacourt, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, but in this instance also the two great <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> triumphed over their adversaries, thanks to the energetic assistance of two <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> (Denifle-Chatelain, "Chart. Univ. <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>" I, <em>passim</em>; Finke, "Des Pariser National Konzil 1290" in "R&ouml;mische Quartalschrift", 1895, p. 171; Paulus, "Welt und Ordensclerus beim Ausgange des XIII. Jahrhunderts in Kampfe um die Pfarr-Rechte", Essen-Ruhr, 1900).

<p>The order gave many of its members to the episcopate, but endeavoured to prevent this. Sts. Dominic and <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">Francis</a> seem to have disapproved of the accession of their religious to <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a> ("Speculum perfectionis", ed. Sabatier, Paris, 1898, p. 75; <a href="../cathen/14694a.htm">Thomas of Celano</a>, "Legenda secunda S. Francisci", III, lxxxvi). Jordanus of Saxony the immediate successor of St. Dominic, forbade all acceptance of election or <a href="../cathen/12319c.htm">postulation</a> to the episcopate, under pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, without special permission of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the general chapter, and the master general ("Acta Cap. Gen.", ed. Reichert, 4). During his administration he resisted with all his strength and declared that he would rather see a friar buried than raised to the episcopate ("Vit&aelig; Fratrum", ed. Reichert, 141, 143, 209). Everyone knows the eloquent letter which <a href="../cathen/07542a.htm">Humbert of Romans</a> wrote to <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a> to dissuade him from accepting the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">See of Ratisbon</a> (1260; Peter of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, "Vita B. Alberti Magni", <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, 1621; p. 253). But all this opposition could not prevent the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of a great many to high <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a>. The worth of many religious made them so prominent that it was impossible that they should not be suggested for the episcopate. Princes and nobles who had sons or kinsmen in the order often laboured for this result with interested motives, but the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> especially saw in the accession of Dominicans to the episcopate the means of infusing it with new blood. From the accession of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> the appointment of Dominicans to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a> became an ordinary thing. Hence until the end of the fifteenth century about fifteen hundred Preachers were either appointed or translated to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> or <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a>, among them men remarkable for their learning, their competent administration, their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of their lives. (Eubel, "Hierarchia catholica", I-II; "Bull Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", I-IV; "Script. Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", I, p. xxi; Cavalieri, "Galleria de' sommi Pontefici, Patriarchi, Areivescovi, e Vescovi dell' ordine de' Predicatori", <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, 1696; Vigna, "I vescovi domenicani Liguri ovvero in Liguria", <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, 1887.)

<p><em>(j) The Preachers and Civil Society</em>

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the Preachers influenced princes and communities. Princes found them to be prudent advisers, expert ambassadors, and enlightened confessors. The French monarchy was much attached to them. As early as 1226 Jordanus of Saxony was able to write, in speaking of Blanche of Castile "The queen tenderly loves the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> and she has spoken with me personally and familiarly about her affairs" (Bayonne, "Lettres du B. Jourdain de Saxe" Paris-Lyons 1865, p. 66). No prince was more devoted to the order than St. Louis, nor did any grant it more favours. The French monarchy sought most of its confessors during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> from the Order of Preachers (Chapotin, "A travers l'histoire dominicaine: "Les princes fran&ccedil;ais du Moyen Age et l'ordre de Saint Dominique", Paris, 1903, p. 207; Idem, "Etudes historiques sur la province dominicainede France", Paris, 1890, p. 128). It was the entrance of Humbert II, Dauphin of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, into the order, which gained Dauphiny for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (Guiffrey, "Hist. de la r&eacute;union du Dauphin&eacute; &agrave; la <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>" <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1878). The Dukes of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> also sought their confessors from the order (Chapotin, op. cit. 190). The kings of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> did likewise and frequently employed its members in their service. (Palmer, "The Kings's Confessors" in "The Antiquary", London, 1890, p. 114; Tarett, "Friars Confessors of the English Kings" in "The Home Counties Magazine", XII, 1910, p. 100). Several German emperors were much attached to the order nevertheless the Preachers did not hesitate to enter into conflict with <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> and Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> when these princes broke with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (Opladen, "Die Stellung der deutschen K&ouml;nige zu den Orden im dreizethnten Jahrhundert" Bonn, 1908; Paulus, "Thomas von Strassburg und Rudolph von Sachsen. Ihre Stellung zum Interdikt" in "Hist. Jahrbuch.", XIII, 1892, 1; "Neues Archiv. der Geschellschaft f&uuml;r altere deutsche Geschictskunde", XXX, 1905, 447). The kings of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> invariably chose their confessors from among the Preachers ("Catalogo de los religiosos Dominicos qui hen servido e a los Se&ntilde;ores de Castilla, de Aragon, y de Andalucia, en el empleo de sus Confessores de Estado", Madrid, 1700). The kings of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> likewise sought their directors from the same source (de Sousa, "Historia de S. Domingos particulor de Reino, e conquistas de <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>" <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, 1767; Gr&eacute;goire, "Hist. des confesseurs les empereurs, des rois et d'autres princes", Paris, 1824).

<p>The first to be established in the centres of cities, the Dominicans exercised a profound influence on municipal life, especially in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. A witness at the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of St. Dominic in 1233 expresses the matter when he says that nearly all the cities of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> and the Marches placed their affairs and their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> in the hands of the Preachers, that they might arrange and alter them to their taste and as seemed to them fitting. The same was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the extirpation of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, the restoration of peace, restitution for <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, hearing of confessions and a multitude of benefits which would be too long to enumerate ("Annales Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", Rome, 1756, append., col. 128). About this time the celebrated John of <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> exercised powerful influence in the north of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and was himself podest&agrave; of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> (Sutter, "Johann von Vicenza und die italienisehe Friedensbewegung im Jahre 1233", Freiburg, 1891; Ital. tr., <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>, 1900; Vitali, "I Domenicani nella vita italiana del secolo XIII", <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 1902; Hefele, "Die Bettelorden und das religi&ouml;se Volksleben Ober-und Mittelitaliensim XIII. Jahrhundert", Leipzig-Berlin, 1910). An <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the penetration of the order into all social classes may be formed from the declaration of Pierre Dubois in 1300 that the Preachers and the Minors <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> better than anyone else the condition of the world and of all social classes ("De recuperatione Terre Sancte", ed. Langlois, Paris, 1891, pp. 51, 74, 84). The part played by <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">Catherine of Siena</a> in the pacification of the towns of Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and the return of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> from <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is well known. "She was the greatest figure of the second half of the fourteenth century, an Italian, not only a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, a mystic, a <a href="../cathen/10350a.htm">miracle-worker</a>, but a statesman, and a great statesman, who solved for the welfare of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and all <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> the most difficult and tragic question of her time" (Gebhart "Une sainte homme d'&eacute;tat, Ste Catherine de Sienne"; in "Revue Hebdomadaire", 16 March, 1907, 257). It was the Dominican <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a> Ad&eacute;mar de la Roche, who granted that town its liberties and franchise in 1387 (Mallet, "Libert&eacute;s, franchises, immunit&eacute;s, et coutumes de la ville de Gen&egrave;ve promulg&eacute;s par &eacute;v&ecirc;que Ad&eacute;mar Fabri le 23 Mai, 1387" in "M&eacute;moires et documents de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'histoire et d'arch&eacute;ologie de Gen&egrave;ve", <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, II, 1843, p. 270). Finally reference must be made to the profound influence exercised by <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Girolamo Savonarola</a> (1498) on the political life of Florence during the last years of the fifteenth century (Vilari, "La Storia di Girolamo Savonarola e d&eacute; suoi tempi", <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1887; Luotto, "Il vero Savonarola", Florence, 1897).

<p><em>(k) The Preachers and the Faithful</em>

<p>During the thirteenth century the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were almost without pastoral care and preaching. The coming of the Preachers was an innovation which won over the people eager for religious instruction. What a chronicler relates of <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a> was the case almost everywhere: "Before the arrival of the Friars Preachers the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was rare and precious and very rarely preached to the people. The Friars Preachers preached alone in every section of <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a> and in the town of Erfurt and no one hindered them" (Koch, "Graf Elger von Holmstein", Gotha, 1865, pp. 70, 72). About 1267 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a>, Guillaume de Flavacourt, in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> already mentioned, declared that the people refused to hear the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from any save the Preachers and Minors (Bibl. de Grenoble, <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> 639, fol. 119). The Preachers exercised a special influence over the piously inclined of both sexes among the masses, so numerous in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and they induced to penance and continence a great many people living in the world, who were commonly called <a href="../cathen/02389c.htm">Beguins</a>, and who lived either alone or in more or less populous communities. Despite the order's attraction for this devout, half-lay, half-religious world, the Preachers refused to take it under their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in order not to hamper their chief activity nor distort their <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ideal by too close contact with lay <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. The General Chapters of 1228 and 1229 forbade the religious to give the habit to any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> or to receive her profession, or to give <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual direction</a> to any community of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> not strictly subject to some authority other than that of the order ("Archiv. f. Litt. a Kirchengesch.", I, 27; <a href="../cathen/02360b.htm">Bayonne</a>, "Lettres du B. Jourdain de Saxe", 110). But the force of circumstances prevailed, and, despite everything, these clients furnished the chief elements of the Penitential Order of St. Dominic, who received their own rule in 1285, and of whom more has been said above (Mosheim, "De Beghardis et Beguiniabus", Leipzig, 1720; Le Grand Les B&eacute;guinesde Paris", 1893; Nimal, "Les Beguinages", Nivelles, 1908). The Order especially encouraged congregations of the Blessed Virgin and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, which developed greatly, especially in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Many of them had their headquarters in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the Preachers, who administered them spiritually. After the Penitential movement of 1260 confraternities were formed commonly called <em>Disciplinati, Battuti</em>, etc. Many of them originated in Dominican churches (there is no general historical work on this subject). In 1274, during the Council of Lyons, <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> confided to the Dominicans the preaching of the Holy Name of Jesus, whence arose confraternities of that name (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Ord. Pr&aelig;d., VIII, 524). Finally the second half of the fifteenth century saw the rapid development of <a href="../cathen/13188b.htm">confraternities of the Holy Rosary</a> under the influence of the Preachers ("Acta Sanctae Sedis nec non magistrorum et capitulorum generalium sacri ordinis Pr&aelig;dicatorum pro Societate SS. Rosarii", Lyons, 1890). With the object of developing the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the faithful the Preachers allowed them to be buried in the habit of the order (Cantimpratanus, "De bono universali apum", lib. II, viii, n. 8). From the time of Jordanus of Saxony they issued letters of participation in the spiritual goods of the order. The same general established at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> the custom of the evening sermon <em>(collatio) </em>for the students of the University, in order to turn them aside from dissipation, which custom passed to all the other <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> ("Vita fratrum", ed. Reichert, 327).

<p><em>(l) The Preachers and the Foreign Missions</em>

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the Order of Preachers exercised considerable activity within the boundaries of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> and far beyond. The evangelization of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> countries was confided to the nearest Dominican provinces. At the beginning of the fourteenth century the missions of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> became a special group, the congregation of Friars Pilgrims for Christ. Some of the remote provinces, especially those of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> and the Holy Land, were recruited from volunteers throughout the order. Besides the work of evangelization the religious frequently assumed the mission of ambassador or agent to <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> princes, and Friars Preachers frequently occupied <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus infidelium</a>.</em> A number of them, faithful to the order's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> vocation, composed works of all kinds to assist their apostolate to defend the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>, to inform the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> or Latin princes concerning the condition of the East, and to indicate measures to be taken against the dangers threatening <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Finally they frequently shed their blood in these inhospitable and unfruitful countries. The province of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> laboured for the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabs</a> of the Peninsula, and in 1256 <a href="../cathen/07542a.htm">Humbert of Romans</a> described the satisfactory results (H. de Romanis, "Opera", ed. Berthier, II, 502). In 1225 the first <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> Dominicans evangelized <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a> and the head of the mission, Brother Dominic, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in that year first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a> (Analecta Ord. Pr&aelig;d., III, 374 sqq.). Some years later they were already established at <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a> ["Mon. Ord. Pr&aelig;d.: Hist.", IV (Barmusidiana) fasc. II, 29]. In 1256 and the ensuing years <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a>, at the instance of St. Raymond of Pennafort, gave a vigorous impulse to this mission (Potthast, 16,438; 17,187; 17,929).

<p>In the north of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the province of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> or that of Dacia carried its establishments as far as Greenland (Teli&eacute;, "L'&eacute;vangelization de l'Am&eacute;rique avant Christophe Colomb" in "Compte rendu du congr&egrave;s scient. intern. des Catholiques", 1891, sect. hist., 1721). As early as 1233 the province of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> promoted the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussians</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/14283c.htm">Stedingers</a>, and brought them to the Faith (Schomberg, "Die Dominikaner im Erzbistum Bremen", <a href="../cathen/03019a.htm">Brunswick</a>, 1910, 14; "Bull. Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", I, 61; H. de Romanis, "Opera", II, 502). The province of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, founded by <a href="../cathen/07591b.htm">St. Hyacinth</a> (1221), extended its apostolate by means of this saint as far as Kieff and Dantizig. In 1246 Brother Alexis resided at the Court of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, and in 1258 the Preachers evangelized the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> (Abraham, "Powstanie organizacyi Kosicio lacinskiego na Rusi", <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>, 1904; Rainaldi, "Annal. eccl.", ad ann. 1246, n. 30; Potthast, 17,186; Baracz, "Rys dziej&oacute; Zakonn Kaznodzie jskiego w Polsce" Lemberg, 1861; Comtesse de Flavigny, "Saint Hyacinthe et ses compagnons", Paris, 1899). The province of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, founded in 1221 by Bl. Paul of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, evangelized the Cumans and the people of the Balkans. As early as 1235-37 Brother Richard and his companions set out in quest of Greater <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> &#151; the Hungarian <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> still dwelling on the Volga ("Vit&aelig; Fratrum", ed. Reichert, 305; "De inventa Hungaria Magna tempore Gregorii IX", ed. Endlicher, in "Rerum Hungaricarum Monumenta", 248; Ferrarius, "De rebus Hungaric&aelig; Provinci&aelig; S. Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", Vienna, 1637).

<p>The province of Greece, founded in 1228, occupied those territories of the empire of the East which had been conquered by the Latins, its chief centre of activity being Constantinople. Here also the Preachers laboured for the return of the schismatics to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> unity ("Script. Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", I, pp. i, xii, 102, 136, 156, 911; Potthast, 3198; "Vit&aelig; fratrum", 1218). The province of the Holy Land established in 1228, occupied all the Latin conquest of the Holy Land besides Nicosia and Tripoli. Its houses on the Continent were destroyed one after the other with the defeat of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and at the beginning of the fourteenth century the province was reduced to the three <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> on the <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Island of Cyprus</a> ("Script. Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", I, pp. i, xii; Balme, "La Province dominicaine de Terre-Sainte de 1277 &agrave; 1280" in "Archives de l'Orient Latin"; Idem, "Les franciscains et les dominicains &agrave; J&eacute;rusalem au treizi&egrave;me et au quatorzi&egrave;me si&egrave;cle", 1890, p. 324). The province of the Holy Land was the starting point for the evangelization of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> during the thirteenth century. As early as 1237 the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a>, Philip, reported to <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> extraordinary results obtained by the religious; the evangelization reached <a href="../cathen/14417a.htm">Jacobites</a> and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronites</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> (Script. Ord. Pr&aelig;d., I, 104). About the same time the Friars established themselves in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> and in Georgia ("Bull. Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", I, 108, "Script. O P.", I, 122; H. de Romanis, "Opera" II, 502 Vinc. Bellovacensis, "Speculum historiale", l. b XXI, 42; Tamarati, "L'&Eacute;glise G&eacute;orgienne des origines jusqu'&agrave; nos jours", Rome, 1910, 430).

<p>The missions of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> continued to develop through out the thirteenth century and part of the fourteenth and missionaries went as far as Bagdad and <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> [Mandonnet, "Fra Ricoldo de Monte Croce" in "Revue bib.", I, 1893; Balme, "Jourdain Cathala de S&eacute;v&eacute;rae, Ev&ecirc;que de Coulain" (Quilon), Lyons, 1886]. In 1312 the master general, B&eacute;ranger de Landore, organized the missions of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> into a special congregation of "Friars Pilgrims", with Franco of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar general</a>. As a base of evangelization they had the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Pera (Constantinople), Capha, <a href="../cathen/15028a.htm">Trebizond</a>, and Negropont. Thence they branched out into <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. In 1318 <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> appointed Franco of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Sultanieh, with six other Dominicans as suffragans. During the first half of the fourteenth century the Preachers occupied many sees in the East. When the missions of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> were destroyed in 1349, the Preachers possessed fifteen <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> there, and the United Brethren (see below) eleven <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. In 1358 the Congregation of Pilgrims still had two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and eight residences. This movement brought about the foundation, in 1330, of the United Brethren of <a href="../cathen/07023a.htm">St. Gregory the Illuminator</a>. It was the work of Bl. Bartolommeo Petit of Bologna, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Maragha, assisted by John of Kerni. It was formed by <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> religious who adopted the Constitution of the Dominicans and were incorporated with the order after 1356. Thirty years after their foundation the United Brethren had in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> alone 50 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> with 700 religious. This province still existed in the eighteenth century [Eubel, "Die w&auml;hrend des 14. Jahrhunderts im Missionsgebiet der Dominikanel und Franziskaner errichteten Bist&uuml;mer" in "Festchrift des deutschen Campo Santo in Rom", Freiburg i. Br., 1897, 170; Heyd, "Die Kolonien der r&ouml;mischen Kirche, welche die Dominikaner und Franziskaner im 13. und 14.

<p><em>(m) The Preachers and Sanctity</em>

<p>It is characteristic of Dominican <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> that its <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> attained <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in the apostolate, in the pursuit or promotion of learning, administration, foreign missions, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, and the episcopate. Until the end of the fifteenth century the order in its three branches gave to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> nine <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and at least seventy-three blessed. Of the first order (the Preachers) are St. Dominic, <a href="../cathen/11773d.htm">St. Peter of Verona</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, St. Raymond of Pennafort, St. Vincent Ferrer, <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a> of Florence. Among the Dominican <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in general there is a predominance of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> over the emotional qualities; their mystical life is more subjective than objective; and asceticism plays a strong part in their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Meditation on the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">sufferings of Christ</a> and His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> was common among them. Mystic states, with the phenomena which accompany them, were ordinary, especially in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in German countries. Many received the <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">stigmata</a> in various forms. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> and <a href="../cathen/05274a.htm">Meister Eckhart</a> were, from different standpoints, the greatest <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> theorists concerning the mystical state (Giffre de Rechac, "Les vies et actions m&eacute;morables des saints canonis&eacute;s de l'ordre des Fr&egrave;res Pr&ecirc;cheurs et de plusieurs bienheureux et illustres personnages du m&ecirc;me ordre", Paris, 1647; Marchese, "Sagro diario domenicano", Naples, 1668, 6 vols. in fol.; Manoel de <a href="../cathen/09255a.htm">Lima</a>, "Agiologio dominico", <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, 1709-54, 4 vols. in fol.; "Ann&eacute;e dominicaine", Lyons, 1883-1909, 12 vols. in 4; Imbert-Gourbeyre, "La Stigmatisation", <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont-Ferrand</a>, 1894; Thomas de Vallgormera, "Mystica theologia D.

<h3 id="B">Modern period</h3>

<p>The modern period consists of the three centuries between the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">religious revolution</a> at the beginning of the sixteenth century (<a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>) and the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> with its consequences. The Order of Preachers, like the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself, felt the shock of these destructive revolutions but its vitality enabled it to withstand them successfully. At the beginning of the sixteenth century the order was on the way to a genuine renaissance when the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Revolutionary upheavals</a> occurred. The progress of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> cost it six or seven provinces and several hundreds of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, but the discovery of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> opened up a fresh field of activity. Its gains in America and those which arose as a consequence of the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> conquests in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> and the Indies far exceeded the losses of the order in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and the seventeenth century saw its highest numerical development. The sixteenth century was a great <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> century, and the movement lasted beyond the middle of the eighteenth. In modern times the order lost much of its influence on the political powers, which had universally fallen into absolutism and had little sympathy for the democratic constitution of the Preachers. The Bourbon Courts of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were particularly unfavourable to them until the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society of Jesus</a>. In the eighteenth century there were numerous attempts at reform which created, especially in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, geographical confusion in the administration. During the eighteenth century the tyrannical spirit of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Powers and, still more, the spirit of the age lessened the number of recruits and the fervour of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> ruined the order in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and the crises which more or less rapidly followed considerably lessened or wholly destroyed numerous provinces.

<p><em>(a) Geographical Distribution and Statistics</em>

<p>The modern period saw a great change in the geographical distribution of provinces and the number of religious in the order. The establishment of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> in Anglo-Saxon countries brought about during the sixteenth century, the total or partial disappearance of certain provinces. The provinces of <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, Dacia, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> completely disappeared, that of Teutonia was mutilated; that of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> sought refuge in various houses on the Continent. The discovery and evangelization of America opened up vast territories, where the first Dominican missionaries established themselves as early as 1510. The first province, with San Domingo and the neighbouring islands for its territory, was erected, under the name of the Holy Cross, in 1530. Others followed quickly &#151; among them St. James of Mexico (1532), St. John Baptist of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a> (1539), St. Vincent of Chiapa (1551), <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a> of <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">New Granada</a> (1551), St. Catherine of <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a> (1580), <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> of <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a> (1592). In <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the order developed constantly from the middle of the sixteenth century till the middle of the eighteenth. New provinces or congregations were formed. Under the government of Serafino Cavalli (1571-78) the order had thirty-one provinces and five congregations. In 1720 it had forty-nine provinces and four congregations. At the former date there were about 900 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>; at the latter, 1200. During Cavalli's time the order had 14,000 religious, and in 1720 more than 20,000. It seems to have reached its greatest numerical development during the seventeenth century. Mention is made of 30,000 and 40,000 Dominicans; perhaps these figures include <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>; it does not seem probable that the number of Preachers alone ever exceeded 25,000. The secularization in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a> under <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> began the work of partial suppression of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, which was continued in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by the Committee of Regulars (1770) until the Convention (1793) finally destroyed all <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> in that country. The <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> conquest overthrew many provinces and houses in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Most of them were eventually restored; but the Revolution destroyed partially or wholly the provinces of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> (1834), <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (1834), and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (1870). The political troubles brought about by the revolt of Latin America from the mother country at the beginning of the nineteenth century partially or wholly destroyed several provinces of the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> ("Script. Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", II, p. I, "Analecta Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", I sqq.; "Dominicanus orbis descriptus"; Mortier, "Hist. des ma&icirc;tres g&eacute;n&eacute;raux", V sqq.; Chapotin, "Le dernier prieur du dernier couvent", Paris, 1893; Rais, "Historia de la provincia de Arag&oacute;n, orden de Predicadores desde le a&ntilde;o 1803 haste el de 1818", <a href="../cathen/13468c.htm">Saragossa</a>, 1819; 1824).

<p><em>(b) Administration of the Order</em>

<p>During the modern period the Preachers remained faithful to the spirit of their organization. Some modifications were necessitated by the general condition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and civil <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Especially noteworthy was the attempt, in 1569, of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a>, the Dominican <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, to restrict the choice of superiors by inferiors and to constitute a sort of administrative aristocracy (Acta Cap. Gener., V, 94). The frequent intervention of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in the government of the order and the pretensions of <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil powers</a>, as well as its great development, diminished the frequency of general chapters; the rapid succession of masters general caused many chapters to be convened during the seventeenth century; in the eighteenth century chapters again became rare. The effective administration passed into the hands of the general assisted by pontifical decrees. During these three centuries the order had many heads who were remarkable for their energy and administrative ability, among them Thomas de Vio (1508-18), Garcia de Loaysa (1518-24), Vincent Giustiniani (1558-70), Nicolo Ridolfi (1629-44), Giovanni Battista de' Marini (1650-69), Antonin Cloche (1686-1720), Antonin Br&eacute;mond (1748-55), John Thomas de Boxadors (Mortier, "Hist. des ma&icirc;tres g&eacute;n&eacute;raux", V sq.; "Acta cap. gen.", IV sq.; "Chronicon magistrorum generalium"; "Regula S. Augustini et Constitutiones Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", Rome, 1695; Paichelli, "Vita del Rmo P. F. Giov. Battista de' Marini", Rome, 1670; Messin, "Vita del Rmo P F. Antonino Cloche", <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, 1721; "Vita Antonini Bremondii" in "Annales Ord. Pr&aelig;d.", Rome, 1756, I, p. LIX).

<p><em>(c) Scholastic Organization</em>

<p>The scholastic organization of the Dominicans during this modern period tended to concentration of studies. The conventual <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> required by the Constitutions disappeared, at least in its essentials, and in each province or congregation the studies were grouped in particular <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. The <em>studia generalia </em>multiplied, as well as <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> incorporated with <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>. The General Chapter of 1551 designates 27 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> towns where, and where only, the religious might take the degree of Master in Theology. Through the generosity of Dominicans in high <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices large colleges for higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> were also established for the benefit of certain provinces. Among the most famous of these were the College of St. Gregory at <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, founded in 1488 by Alonzo of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, adviser and confessor of the kings of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a> (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. O. P., IV, 38); that of St. Thomas at <a href="../cathen/13744a.htm">Seville</a>, established in 1515 by Archbishop Diego de Deza ("Historia del colegio major de Ste Tom&aacute;sde Sevilla", Seville, 1890). The Preachers also established <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> in their chief provinces in America &#151; San Domingo (1538), Santa F&eacute; de Bogot&aacute; (1612), <a href="../cathen/12615b.htm">Quito</a> (1681), Havana (1721) &#151; and even in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a> (1645) is still flourishing and in their hands. During the sixteenth and following centuries the schedule of studies was more than once revised, and the matter extended to meet the needs of the times. Oriental studies especially received a vigorous impulse under the generalship of Antonin Br&eacute;mond (Fabricy, "Des titres primitifs de la R&eacute;v&eacute;lation", Rome, 1772, II, 132; "Acta. Cap. Gen.", IV-VII; "Bull. O. P.", <em>passim</em>; V. de la Fuente, "La ense&ntilde;anza Tomistica en Espa&ntilde;a", <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 1874; Contarini "Notizie storiche circa gli publici professori nello studio di Padova scelti dall' ordine di San Domenieo", Venice, 1769).

<p><em>(d) Doctrinal Activity</em>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> activity of the Preachers continued during the modern period. The order, closely connected with the events of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in German countries, faced the revolutionary movement as best it could, and by preaching and writing deserved what Dr. Paulus has said of it: "It may well be said that in the difficult conflict through which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had to pass in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in the sixteenth century no other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order furnished in the literary sphere so many champions, or so well equipped, as the Order of St. Dominic" ("Die deutschen Dominikaner in Kampfe gegen Luther, 1518-1563", Freiburg i. Br., 1903). The order was conspicuous by the number and influence of the Dominican <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> who took part in the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. To a certain extent <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> predominated in the discussions and decisions of the council, so that <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>, in 1593, could say, when he desired the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to follow <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, that the council approved and accepted his works (Astrain, "Historia de la Compa&ntilde;ia de J&eacute;sus en la asistencia de Espa&ntilde;a", III, <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 1909, 580). The "Catechismus ad Parochos", the composition of which had been ordered by the council, and which was published at the command of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> (1566), is the work of Dominican <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> (Reginaldus, "De catechismi romani auctoritate dissertatio", Naples, 1765). The <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> Dominican School of the sixteenth century, inaugurated by Francisco de Vitoria (d. 1540), produced a series of eminent <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>: Melchior Cano (1560), the celebrated author of "De locis theologicis"; Domingo Soto (1500); Bartolom&eacute; de Medina (1580); <a href="../cathen/02247a.htm">Domingo Ba&ntilde;ez</a>. This line of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> was continued by Tom&aacute;s de Lemos (1629); Diego Alvarez (1635); Juan de S. Tom&aacute;s (1644), ["Script. O.P.", II, s. vv.; P. Getino, "Historia de un convento" (St. Stephen of Salamanca), Vergara, 1904 Ehrle, "Die Vatikanischen Handschriften der Salamanticenser Theologen des sechszehnten Jahrhunderts" in "Der Katholik", 64-65, 1884-85; L. G. Getino, "El maestro Fr. Francisco de Vitoria" in "La Ciencia tomista", <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, I, 1910, 1; <a href="../cathen/03125a.htm">Caballero</a>, "Vida del Illmo. dr. D. Fray Melchor Cano", <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 1871; Alvarez, "Santa Teresa y el P. Ba&ntilde;ez", <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 1882].

<p>Italy furnished a contingent of Dominican <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of note, of whom <a href="../cathen/03145c.htm">Thomas de Vio Cajetan</a> (d. 1534) was incontestably the most famous (Cossio, "II cardinale Gaetano e la riforma", Cividale, 1902). Franceseo Silvestro di <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> (d. 1528) left a valuable commentary on the "Summa contra Gentiles" (Script. O. P., II, 59). Chrysostom Javelli, a dissenter from the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic School</a>, left very remarkable writings on the moral and political <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> (op. cit., 104). Catharinus (1553) is a famous polemicist, but an unreliable <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> (Schweizer, "Ambrosius Catharinus Politus, 1484-1553, ein Theologe des Reformations-zeitalters", M&uuml;nster, 1910). <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> likewise produced excellent <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> &#151; Jean Nicolai (d. 1673); <a href="../cathen/04330a.htm">Vincent de Contenson</a> (d. 1674); Antoine* Reginald (d. 1676); <a href="../cathen/06634a.htm">Jean-Baptiste Gonet</a> (d. 1681); Antoine* Gondin (d. 1695); Antonin Manouli&eacute; (d. 1706); <a href="../cathen/01296c.htm">No&euml;l Alexandre (Natalis Alexander)</a> (d. 1724); Hyacinthe de Graveson (d. 1733); Hyacinthe Serry (d.1738) ("Seript. O. P.", II; <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a> "Nomenelator", IV; H. Serry, "Opera omnia", I, Lyons, 1770, p. 5). From the sixteenth century to the eighteenth the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomistic School</a> upheld by the authority of Dominican general chapters and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, the official adhesion of new <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and various <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculties, but above all by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, enjoyed an increasing and undisputed authority.

<p>The disputes concerning <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> which disturbed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, originated in the theory of probability advanced by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> Dominican Bartolom&eacute; de Medina in 1577. Several <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the order adopted, at the beginning of the seventeenth century the theory of moral probability; but in consideration of the abuses which resulted from these doctrines the General Chapter of 1656 condemned them, and after that time there were no more Probabilists among the Dominicans. The condemnations of <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> (1665, 1667), the famous <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>, and various acts of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> combined to make the Preachers resolute opponents of <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>. The publication of <a href="../cathen/04191a.htm">Concina's</a> "Storia del probabilismo" in 1743 renewed the controversy. He displayed enormous activity, and his friend and disciple, Giovanni Vicenzo Patuzzi (d. 1769) defended him in a series of vigorous writings. <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a> felt the consequences of these disputes, and, in consideration of the position taken by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, greatly modified his theoretical system of probability and expressed his desire to adhere to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> (Mandonnet, "Le d&eacute;cret d'Innocent XI contre le probabilisme", in "Revue Thomiste" 1901-03; Ter Haar, "Des Decret des Papstes Innocenz XI &uuml;ber den Probabilismus", <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, 1904; <a href="../cathen/04191a.htm">Concina</a>, "Della storia del Probabilismo e del Rigorismo", <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, 1743; Mondius, "Studio storico-critico sul sistema morale di S. Alfonso M.de Liguori", Monza, 1911; D&ouml;linger-Reuseh, "Gesch. der Moralstreitigkelten", Nordlingen, 1889).

<p><em>(e) Scientific productions</em>

<p>The literary activity of the Preachers of the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries was not confined to the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> movement noticed above, but shared in the general movement of erudition in the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a>. Among the most noteworthy productions were the works of Pagnini (d. 1541) on the Hebrew text of Scripture; his lexicons and grammars were famous in their day and exercised a lasting influence (Script. O. P., II 114); Sixtus of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> (d. 1569), a converted <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> created the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of introduction to the sacred Books with his "Bibliotheca Sancta" (Venice, 1566; op. cit., 206); <a href="../cathen/06606c.htm">Jacques Goar</a>, liturgist and <a href="../cathen/11302c.htm">Orientalist</a> published the "Euchologium sive rituale Gr&aelig;eorum" (Paris, 1647), a work which, according to <a href="../cathen/12769a.htm">Renaudot</a>, was unsurpassed by anything in its time (<a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a>, "Nomenclat. litt.", III, 1211). Fran&ccedil;ois Combefis (d. 1679) issued editions of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> and writers (op. cit., IV, 161). <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Michel le Quien</a>, <a href="../cathen/11302c.htm">Orientalist</a>, produced a monumental work in his "Oriens Christianus". Vansleb (d. 1679) was twice sent by <a href="../cathen/04096a.htm">Colbert</a> to the Orient, whence he brought a large number of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> for the Biblioth&egrave;que du Roi (Pougeois "Vansleb", Paris, 1869). Thomas Mammachi (d. 1792) left a large unfinished work, "Origines et Antiquitates Christian&aelig;" (Rome, 1753-57).

<p>In the historical field mention must be made of <a href="../cathen/03397a.htm">Bartholomew de Las Casas</a> (d. 1566) who left a valuable "Historia de las Indias" (Madrid, 1875), <a href="../cathen/01296c.htm">No&euml;l Alexandre</a> (d. 1724) left an <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> which was long held in esteem [<a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1676-89; (Dict. de Th&eacute;ol. Cath., I, 769)]. <a href="../cathen/11325a.htm">Joseph Augustin Orsi</a> (d. 1761) wrote an "Historia eelesiastica" which was continued by his confr&egrave;re Filippo Angelo Becchetti (d. 1814). The last edition (Rome, 1838) ; numbers 50 volumes (Kirchenlex., IX, 1087). <a href="../cathen/04091a.htm">Nicolas Coeffeteau</a> was, according to Vaugelas, one of the two greatest masters of the <a href="../cathen/06190a.htm">French language</a> at the beginning of the eighteenth century (Urbain, "Nicolas Coeffeteau, dominicain, &eacute;v&ecirc;que de Marseille, un des fondateurs de la prose fran&ccedil;aise, 1574-1623", Paris, 1840). <a href="../cathen/03221b.htm">Thomas Campanella</a> (d. 1639) won renown by his numerous writings on <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and sociology as well as by the boldness of his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and his eventful life (Dict. de th&eacute;ol. Bath., II, 1443). Jacques Barelier (d. 1673) left one of the foremost botanical works of his time, which was edited by <a href="../cathen/08569a.htm">A. de Jussieu</a>, "Icones plantarum per Galliam, Hispaniam et Italiam observatarum ad vivum exhibitarum" [<a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1714; (Script. O. P., II, 645)].

<p><em>(f) The Preachers and Christian Society</em>

<p>During the modern period the order performed countless services for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Their importance may be gathered from the fact that during this period it gave to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> two <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a> (1566-72) and <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> (1724-30), forty <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and more than a thousand <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. From the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a> in the sixteenth century a special place was reserved for the Preachers; thus the titulars of the Commissariat of the Holy Office and the secretary of the Index were always chosen from this order. The title of Consultor of the Holy Office also belonged by right to the master general and the <a href="../cathen/10039a.htm">Master of the Sacred Palace</a> (<a href="../cathen/06376a.htm">Gams</a>,("Series episcoporum ecclesiae catholicae", Ratisbon, 1873; Falloux, "Histoire de Saint Pie V", Paris, 1858; Borgia, "Benedicti XIII vita", Rome, 1741; Catalano, "De secretario Indicis", <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 1751). The influence of the Preachers on the political powers of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> was unequally exercised during this period: they remained confessors of the kings of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> until 1700; in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> their credit decreased especially under <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, from whom they had much to suffer ("Catalogo de los religiosos dominicanos confessores de Estado, 1700"; Chapotin, "La guerre de succession de Poissy, 1660-1707", Paris, 1892).

<p><em>(g) The Preachers and the Missions</em>

<p>The missions of the Preachers reached their greatest development during the modern period. They were fostered, on the one hand, by the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> conquests in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> and the East Indies and, on the other, by the Spanish conquests in America and Western <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. As early as the end of the fifteenth century Portuguese Dominicans reached the West Coast of Africa and, accompanying the explorers, rounded the Cape of Good Hope to settle on the coast of East Africa. They founded temporary or permanent missions in the Portuguese African settlements and went in succession to the Indies, <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>, <a href="../cathen/13765a.htm">Siam</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09562a.htm">Malacca</a>. They made <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> the centre of these missions which in 1548 were erected into a special mission of the Holy Cross, which had to suffer from the British conquest, but continued to flourish till the beginning of the nineteenth century. The order gave a great many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to these regions [<a href="../cathen/13464a.htm">Jo&atilde;o dos Santos</a>, "Ethiopia oriental", <a href="../cathen/05670a.htm">Evora</a>, 1609; re-edited <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, 1891; Cacegas-de Sousa, "Historia de S. Domingo partidor do reino e conquistas de Portugal", <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, 1767 (Vol. IV by Lucas de Santa Catharina); Andr&eacute; Marie, "Missions dominicaines dans l'extr&ecirc;me Orient", Lyons-Paris, 1865]. The discovery of America soon brought Dominican evangelization in the footsteps of the <em>conquistadores, </em>one of them Diego de Deza, was the constant defender of <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Christopher Columbus</a>, who declared (letter of 21 Dec. 1504) that it was to him the Sovereigns of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> owed the possession of the Indies (Mandonnet, "Les dominicains et la d&eacute;couverte de l'Am&eacute;rique", <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> 1893). The first missionaries reached the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> in 1510, and preaching was quickly extended throughout the conquered countries, where they organized the various provinces already mentioned and found in <a href="../cathen/03397a.htm">Bartolom&eacute; de las Casas</a> who took the habit of the order, their most powerful assistant in the defence of the Indians.

<p>St. Louis Bertrand (d. 1581) was the great apostle of <a href="../cathen/04121b.htm">New Granada</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13192c.htm">St. Rose of Lima</a> (d. 1617) the first flower of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a> (Remesal "Historia de la provincia de S.

Dominican evangelization went from America to the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> (1586) and thence to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> (1590), where Gaspar of the Holy Cross, of the Portuguese Congregation of the Indies, had already begun to work in 1559. The Preachers established themselves in <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> (1601), in Tonking (1676), and in the Island of Formosa. This flourishing mission passed through persecutions, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has raised its numerous <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> to her altars [Ferrando-Fonseca, "Historia de los PP.

Domenico", Rome, 1906]. In 1635 the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> Dominicans began the evangelization of the French Antilles, Guadaloupe, Martinique etc., which lasted until the end of the eighteenth century (Du Tertre, "Hist. g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des Antilles", Paris, 1667-71; Labat "Nouveau voyage aux isles de l'Am&eacute;rique", <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> 1742). In 1750 the Mission of Mesopotamia and Kurdistan was founded by the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> religious; it passed to the Province of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (Paris) in 1856 (Goormachtigh, "Hist. de la mission Dominicaine en M&eacute;sopotamie et Kurdistan", in "Analecta O. P." III, 271).

<p><em>(h) Dominican Saints and Blessed</em>

<p>From the beginning of the sixteenth century members of the Order of St. Dominic eminent for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> were the subjects of twenty-one canonizations or beatifications. Some of the beatifications included a more or less large number at one time: such were the Annamite <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, who formed a group of twenty-six <em>beati</em> <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> 21 May, 1900, by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of Tonking, who numbered eight, the last of whom died in 1861, and who were <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, 28 Nov., 1905. Five <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> during this period; <a href="../cathen/06651c.htm">St. John of Gorkum</a> (d. 1572), <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a> (d. 1572), the last <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>; St. Louis Bertrand (d. 1581), missionary in the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>; <a href="../cathen/03444a.htm">St. Catherine de' Ricci</a> (d. 1589), of the second order, and <a href="../cathen/13192c.htm">St. Rose of Lima</a> (d. 1617), tertiary, the first American saint. (See general bibliography of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in section <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> above.)
<h3 id="C">Contemporaneous period</h3>

<p>The contemporaneous period of the history of the Preachers begins with the different restorations of provinces under taken after the revolutions which had destroyed the order in several countries of the Old World and the New. This period begins more or less early in the nineteenth century, and it cannot be traced down to the present day without naming religious who are still living and whose activity embodies the present life of the order. The revolutions not having totally destroyed certain of the provinces, nor decimated them, simultaneously, the Preachers were able to take up the laborious work of restoration in countries where the civil legislation did not present insurmountable obstacles. During this critical period the number of Preachers seems never to have sunk below 3500. The statistics for 1876 give 3748 religious, but 500 of these had been expelled from their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and were engaged in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> work. The statistics for 1910 give a total of very nearly 4472 religious both nominally and actually engaged in the proper activities of the order. They are distributed in 28 provinces and 5 congregations, and possess nearly 400 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> or secondary establishments.

<p>In the revival movement <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> held a foremost place, owing to the reputation and convincing power of the immortal orator, <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Henri-Dominique Lacordaire</a> (1802-61). He took the habit of a Friar Preacher at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1839), and the province of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was canonically erected in 1850. From this province were detached the province of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, called Occitania (1862), that of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (1869), and that of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> (1909). The French restoration likewise furnished many labourers to other provinces, to assist in their organization and progress. From it came the master general who remained longest at the head of the administration during the nineteenth century, <a href="../cathen/08282b.htm">P&egrave;re Vincent Jandel</a> (1850-72). Here should be mentioned the province of St. Joseph in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Founded in 1805 by Father Dominic Fenwick, afterwards first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a> (1821-32), this province has developed slowly, but now ranks among the most flourishing and active provinces of the order. In 1910 it numbered 17 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> or secondary houses. In 1905 it established a large house of studies at Washington.

<p>The province of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (Paris) has produced a large number of preachers, several of whom became renowned. The conferences of Notre-Dame-de-Paris were inaugurated by <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">P&egrave;re Lacordaire</a>. The Dominicans of the province of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> furnished most of the orators: <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a> (1835-36, 1843-51), <a href="../cathen/10508c.htm">Jacques Monsabr&eacute;</a> (1869-70, 1872-90), Joseph Ollivier (1871, 1897), Thomas Etourneau (1898-1902). Since 1903 the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> of Notre Dame has again been occupied by a Dominican. <a href="../cathen/04782a.htm">P&egrave;re Henri Didon</a> (d. 1900) was one of the most esteemed orators of his time. The province of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> displays greater <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and scientific activity than ever, the chief centre being the house of studies at present situated at Kain, near <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, where are published "L'Ann&eacute;e Dominicaine" (founded 1859), "La Revue des Sciences Philosophiques et Theologiques" (1907), and "La Revue de la Jeunesse" (1909).

<p>The province of the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, the most populous in the order, is recruited from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where it has several preparatory houses. In the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> it has charge of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a>, recognized by the Government of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, two colleges, and six establishments; in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> it administers the missions of North and South Fo-Kien, in the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> Empire, those of Formosa and Shikoku, besides establishments at <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, at <a href="../cathen/03328d.htm">Caracas</a> (Venezuela) and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The province of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> has seventeen establishments in the Peninsula and the Canaries, as well as the missions of Urubamba (Peru). Since 1910 it has published at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> an important review, "La Ciencia Tomista". The province of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> has a score of establishments, and the missions of <a href="../cathen/04569e.htm">Cura&ccedil;ao</a> and Puerto Rico. Other provinces also have their missions. That of <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> has establishments at Constantinople and Smyrna; that of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>; that of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, in <a href="../cathen/04558c.htm">Cuba</a>, that of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a> and Trinidad; that of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/04228a.htm">Belgian Congo</a>, and so on.

<p>Doctrinal development has had an important place in the restoration of the Preachers. Several institutions besides those already mentioned have played important parts. Such is the Biblical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, open to the religious of the order and to <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clerics</a>, and which publishes the "Revue Biblique", so highly esteemed in the learned world. The faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, confided to the care of the Dominicans in 1890, is flourishing and has about 250 students. The Collegium Angelicum, established at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1911) by Hyacinth Cormier (master general since 1902), is open to regulars and seculars for the study of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">sacred sciences</a>. To the reviews mentioned above must be added the "Revue Thomiste", founded by P&egrave;re Thomas Coconnier (d. 1908), and the "Analecta Ordinis Pr&aelig;dicatorum" (1893). Among the numerous writers of the order in this period are: Cardinals Thomas Zigliara (d. 1893) and Zephirin Gonz&aacute;lez* (d. 1894), two esteemed <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>; Father Alberto Guillelmotti (d. 1893), historian of the Pontifical Navy, and <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Father Heinrich Denifle</a>, one of the most famous writers on <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval history</a> (d. 1905).

<p>In 1910 the order had twenty <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, one of whom, Andreas Fr&uuml;hwirth, formerly master general (1892-1902), is <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Apostolic nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> (Sanvito, "Catalogus omnium provinciarum sacri ordinis praedicatorum", Rome, 1910; "Analecta O. P.", Rome, 1893--; "L'Ann&eacute;e Dominicaine", Paris, 1859--). In the last two publications will be found historical and bibliographical information concerning the history of the Preachers during the contemporaneous period.
<h3 id="B">The Second Order; Dominican Sisters</h3>

<p>The circumstances under which St. Dominic established the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at Prouille (1206) and the legislation given the second order have been related above. As early as 1228 the question arose as to whether the Order of Preachers would accept the government of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The order itself was strongly in favour of avoiding this ministry and struggled long to maintain its freedom. But the sisters found, even among the Preachers, such advocates as the master general, Jordanus of Saxony (d. 1236), and especially the Dominican <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, Hugh of St. Cher (d. 1263), who promised them that they would eventually be victorious (1267). The incorporation of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> with the order continued through the latter part of the thirteenth and during the next century. In 1288 the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, Giovanni Boccanazzi, simultaneously placed all the Penitent Sisters of St. Mary Magdalen in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> under the government of the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the Preachers, but this step was not final. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of sisters incorporated with the order were especially numerous in the province of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> The statistics for 1277 show 58 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> already incorporated, 40 of which were in the single province of Teutonia. The statistics for 1303 give 149 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of Dominican <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and these figures increased during the succeeding centuries. Nevertheless, a certain number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> passed under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. In the list of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> drawn up during the generalship of Serafino Cavalli (1571-78) there are only 168 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> are not indicated for most provinces, and the number should really be much higher. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> placed all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but the Preachers frequently provided these houses with <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> or almoners. The statistics for 1770 give 180 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, but they are incomplete. The revolutions, which affected the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> situation in most <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries from the end of the eighteenth century, brought about the suppression of a great many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; several, however, survived these disturbances, and others were re-established. In the list for 1895 there are more than 150 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> including some of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a>, which are <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a> like the Second Order. These <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> are most numerous in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries witnessed the development of an intense mystical life, and several of these houses have preserved accounts of the life of the sisters, usually in the vernacular. The Dominican sisters, instructed and directed by an order of preachers and teachers, were remarkable not only for spiritual but also for <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> culture. In the course of seven centuries various <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> have left literary and artistic works which bear witness to the culture of some of these <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> ("Script. O. P.", I, pp. i-xv; II, pp. i-xix, 830; "Bull. O. P.", <em>passim</em>; Mortier, "Hist. des maitres g&eacute;n&eacute;raux", <em>passim; </em>Danzas, "Etudes sur les temps primitifs de l'ordre de St. Dominique", IV, Poitiers-Paris (1877); "Analecta O. P.", <em>passim</em>; <a href="../cathen/07025b.htm">Greith</a>, "Die deutsche Mystik im Prediger Orden", Freiburg i. Br., 1861; de Villermont, "Un groupe mystique allemand", Brussels, 1907).
<h3 id="C">The Third Order</h3>

<p>Neither St. Dominic nor the early Preachers wished to have under their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> &#151; and consequently under their responsibility &#151; either religious or lay associations. We have seen their efforts to be relieved of the government of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> who, nevertheless, were following the rule of the order. But numerous <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, and especially lay <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who were leading in the world a life of penance or observing continence, felt the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> influence of the order and grouped themselves about its <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. In 1285 the need of more firmly uniting these lay elements and the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of bringing under the direction of the Preachers a portion of the Order of Penance led the seventh master general, Mu&ntilde;on de Zamora, at the instance of <a href="../cathen/07459a.htm">Honorius IV</a> to draw up the rule known as that of the Penance of St. Dominic. Inspired by that of the Brothers of Penance, this rule had a more <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> character and firmly subordinated the conduct of the brothers to the authority of the Preachers. <a href="../cathen/07459a.htm">Honorius IV</a> confirmed the foundation by the collation of a privilege (28 Jan., 1286). The former master general of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>, Jerome d'Ascoli, having become <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1288 under the name of <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a>, regarded the action of his predecessor and of the master general of the Friars-Preachers as a kind of defiance of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> who considered themselves the natural protectors of the Brothers of Penance, and by his letters of 17 August, 1289, he sought to prevent the desertion of the Brothers of Penance. Mu&ntilde;on de Zamora discharged his office of master general as it had been confided to him by <a href="../cathen/09724a.htm">Martin IV</a>. The Order of Preachers protested with all its might against what it regarded as an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. These events retarded the development of the Dominican <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a>, a portion of the Preachers remaining un favourable to the institution. Nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> continued to exist; one of its fraternities, that of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, was especially flourishing, a list of its members from 1311 being extant The sisters numbered 100 in 1352, among them she who was to become <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a>. They numbered 92 in 1378. The reforming movement of Raymund of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, confessor and historian of St. Catherine, aimed at the spread of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a>; in this Thomas Caffarini of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> was especially active. The Dominican <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> received new <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> from <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>, 18 January, 1401, and on 27 April of the following year the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> published its rule in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, whereupon its development received a fresh impetus. It never became very widespread, the Preachers having sought quality rather than number of tertiaries. <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a>, <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1461, is the patroness of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a>, and, following the example of her who has been called the <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, the Dominican tertiaries have always manifested special devotion to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. Also in imitation of their patroness, who wrote splendid mystical works, they endeavoured to acquire a special <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of their religion, as befits <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> incorporated with a great <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> order. The <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> has given several blessed to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, besides <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a> and <a href="../cathen/13192c.htm">St. Rose of Lima</a>. For several centuries there have been regular <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and congregations belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a>. The nineteenth century witnessed the establishment of a large number of regular congregations of tertiaries devoted to <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> or <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. In 1895 there were about 55 congregations with about 800 establishments and 20,000 members. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> there are flourishing <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> at Sinsinawa (Wisconsin), Jersey City, Traverse (Michigan), <a href="../cathen/04149a.htm">Columbus (Ohio)</a>, Albany (New York), and San Francisco (California).

<p>In 1852 <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">P&egrave;re Lacordaire</a> founded in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> a congregation of Priests for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth called the Third Teaching Order of St. Dominic. It is now regarded as a special province of the Order of Preachers, and had flourishing and select colleges in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at Oullins (1853), Sor&egrave;ze (1854), Arceuil (1863), Arcachon (1875), <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (Ecole Lacordaire 1890). These houses have ceased to be directed by Dominicans since the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of 1903. The teaching Dominicans now have the Coll&egrave;ge Lacordaire at <a href="../cathen/03035a.htm">Buenos Aires</a>, Champittet at <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a> (Switzerland), and San Sebastian (Spain). During the Paris Commune four <a href="../cathen/04168a.htm">martyrs</a> of the teaching order died in company with a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the First Order, 25 May, 1871. One of them, P&egrave;re Louis Raphael Captier was an eminent educator (Mandonnet, "Les r&egrave;gles et le gouvernement de l'ordo de Poenitentia au XIIIe si&egrave;cle" in "Opuscules de critique historique", IV, Paris, 1902; Federici, "Istoria de' Cavalieri Gaudenti", Venice, 1787).
