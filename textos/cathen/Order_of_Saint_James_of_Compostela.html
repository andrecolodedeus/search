<h1>Order of Saint James of Compostela</h1>  

<p>(SANTIAGO DE LA ESPADA).

<p>Founded in the twelfth century, owes its name to the national patron of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, St. James the Greater, under whose banner the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Galicia began in the ninth century to combat and drive back the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Compostela, in Galicia, the centre of devotion to this Apostle, is neither the cradle nor the principal seat of the order. Two cities contend for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of having given it birth, Le&oacute;n in the kingdom of that name, and Ucl&eacute;s in Castile. At that time (1157-1230) the royal dynasty was divided into two rival branches, which rivalry tended to obscure the beginnings of the order. The Knights of Santiago had possessions in each of the kingdoms, but Ferdinand II of <a href="../cathen/09177a.htm">Le&oacute;n</a> and Alfonso VIII of Castile, in bestowing them, set the condition that the seat of the order should be in their respective states. Hence arose long disputes which only ended in 1230 when Ferdinand III, the Saint, united both crowns. Thenceforth, Ucl&eacute;s, in the Province of Cuenca, was regarded as the headquarters of the order; there the grand master habitually resided, aspirants passed their year of probation, and the rich archives of the order were preserved until united in 1869 with the "Archivo historico nacional" of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. The order received its first rule in 1171 from Cardinal Jacinto (later <a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Celestine III</a>), then <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>. Unlike the contemporary orders of Calatrava and Alc&aacute;ntara, which followed the severe rule of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a>, Santiago adopted the milder rule of the Canons of St. Augustine. In fact at <a href="../cathen/09177a.htm">Le&oacute;n</a> they offered their services to the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Canons Regular</a> of St. Eloi in that town for the protection of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to the shrine of St. James and the hospices on the roads leading to Compostela. This explains the mixed character of their order, which is hospitaller and military, like that of <a href="../cathen/07477a.htm">St. John of Jerusalem</a>. They were recognized as religious by <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 5 July, 1175, was subsequently confirmed by more than twenty of his successors. These pontifical acts, collected in the "Bullarium" of the order, secured them all the privileges and exemptions of other monastic orders. The order comprised several affiliated classes: canons, charged with the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; canonesses, occupied with the service of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>; religious <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> living in community, and married <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marry</a>, which other <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a> only obtained at the end of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, was accorded them from the beginning under certain conditions, such as the authorization of the king, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of observing continence during <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>, <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, and on certain festivals of the year, which they spent at their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in retreat.

<p>The mildness of this rule furthered the rapid spread of the order, which eclipsed the older orders of Calatrava and Alc&aacute;ntara, and whose power was reputed abroad even before 1200. The first <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of confirmation, that of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, already enumerated a large number of endowments. At its height Santiago alone had more possessions than Calatrava and Alc&aacute;ntara together. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> these possessions included 83 commanderies, of which 3 were reserved to the grand commanders, 2 cities, 178 boroughs and villages, 200 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 5 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 5 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and 1 college at Salamanca. The number of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> was then 400 and they could muster more than 1000 lances. They had possessions in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and even Palestine. Abrantes, their first commandery in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, dates from the reign of Alfonso I in 1172, and soon became a distinct order which <a href="../cathen/11057a.htm">Nicholas IV</a> in 1290 released from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of Ucl&eacute;s. Their military history is linked with that of the Spanish states. They assisted in driving out the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>, doing battle with them sometimes separately, sometimes with the royal armies. They also had a regrettable share in the fatal dissensions which disturbed the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and brought about more than one <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in the order. Finally they took part in the maritime expeditions against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>. Thus arose the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> imposed upon aspirants to serve six months in the galleys, which <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> still existed in the eighteenth century, but from which exemption was easily purchased. Authority was exercised by a grand master assisted by a Council of Thirteen, which elected the grand master and had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to depose him for due cause; they had supreme <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in all disputes between members of the order. The first grand master, Pedro Fern&aacute;ndez de Fuente Encalato, died in 1184. He had had 39 successors, among them several Spanish Infantes, when, in 1499, Ferdinand the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> induced the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to assign to him the administration of the order. Under <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, <a href="../cathen/01159b.htm">Adrian VI</a> annexed to the crown of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the three great <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a> (Alc&aacute;ntara, Calatrava, and Santiago) with hereditary transmission even in the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> line (1522). Thenceforth the three orders were united under one government, though their titles and possessions remained separate. To discharge the detail of this administration, <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> instituted a special ministry, the Council of Orders, composed of a president named by the king, whom he represented, and six <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, two delegates from each order. To this council belonged the presentation of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> to vacant commanderies and <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in all matters, civil or <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, save the purely spiritual cases reserved for ecclesiatical dignitaries. Thus ended the autonomy of the orders (see <a href="../cathen/03149d.htm">MILITARY ORDER OF CALATRAVA</a>). Their symbol was a red cross terminating in a sword, which recalls their title <em>de la Espada</em>, and a shell (<em>la venera</em>), which they doubtless owed to their connection with the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of St. James.
