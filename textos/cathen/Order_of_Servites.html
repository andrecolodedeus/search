<h1>Order of Servites</h1>  

<p>(SERVANTS OF MARY).

<p>The Order of Servites is the fifth mendicant order, the objects of which are the sanctification of its members, preaching the Gospel, and the propagation of <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Mother of God</a>, with special reference to her sorrows. In this article we shall consider: (1) the foundation and history of the order; (2) devotions and manner of life; (3) affiliated associations; (4) Servites of distinction.
<h2 id="section1">Foundation and history</h2>

<p>To the city of Florence belongs the glory of giving to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the seven youths who formed the nucleus of the order: Buonfiglio dei Monaldi (Bonfilius), Giovanni di Buonagiunta (Bonajuncta), Bartolomeo degli Amidei (Amideus), Ricovero dei Lippi-Ugguccioni (Hugh), Benedetto dell' Antella (Manettus), Gherardino di Sostegno (Sosteneus), and Alessio de' Falconieri (Alexius); they belonged to seven patrician <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of that city, and had early formed a confraternity of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, known as the Laudesi, or Praisers of Mary.

<p>While engaged in the exercises of the confraternity on the feast of the Assumption, 1233, the Blessed Virgin appeared to them, advised them to withdraw from the world and devote themselves entirely to eternal things. They obeyed, and established themselves close to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> at La Camarzia, a suburb of Florence. Desiring stricter seclusion than that offered at La Camarzia, they withdrew to Monte Senario, eleven miles north of Florence. Here the Blessed Virgin again appeared to them, conferred on them a black habit, instructed them to follow the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a> and to found the order of her servants (15 April, 1240). The brethren elected a superior, took the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of obedience, chastity, and poverty, and admitted associates.

<p>In 1243, <a href="../cathen/11773d.htm">Peter of Verona</a> (St. Peter Martyr), Inquisitor-General of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, recommended the new foundation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but it was not until 13 March, 1249, that the first official approval of the order was obtained from Cardinal Raniero Capocci, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. About this time St. Bonfilius obtained permission to found the first branch of the order at Cafaggio outside the walls of Florence. Two years later (2 Oct., 1251) <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> appointed Cardinal Guglielmo Fieschi first protector of the order. The next <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a>, favoured a plan for the amalgamation of all institutes following the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>. This was accomplished in March, 1256, and about the same time a Rescript was issued confirming the Order of the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a> as a separate body with power to elect a general. Four years later a general chapter was convened at which the order was divided into two provinces, <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> and Umbria, the former of which St. Manettus directed, while the latter was given into the care of St. Sostene. Within five years two new provinces were added, namely, Romagna and <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. After St. Philip Benizi was elected general (5 June, 1267) the order, which had long been the object of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> attack from jealous enemies, entered into the crisis of its existence. The <a href="../cathen/09476c.htm">Second Council of Lyons</a> in 1274 put into execution the ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a>, forbidding the foundation of new <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, and absolutely suppressed all <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant</a> institutions not yet approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The aggressors renewed their assaults, and in the year 1276 <a href="../cathen/08018a.htm">Innocent V</a> in a letter to St. Philip declared the order suppressed. St. Philip proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but before his arrival there <a href="../cathen/08018a.htm">Innocent V</a> had died. His successor lived but five weeks. Finally <a href="../cathen/08429c.htm">John XXI</a>, on the favourable opinion of three consistorial advocates, decided that the order should continue as before. The former dangers reappeared under <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> (1281), and though other <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> continued to favour the order, it was not definitively approved until <a href="../cathen/02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a> issued the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Dum levamus" (11 Feb., 1304). Of the seven founders, St. Alexis alone lived to see their foundation raised to the dignity of an order. He died in 1310.

<p>We must here make mention of St. Peregrine Laziosi (Latiosi), whose <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of life did much towards increasing the repute of the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a> Order in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Born at <a href="../cathen/06137a.htm">Forli</a> in 1265, the son of a <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> leader, Peregrine, in his youth, bitterly <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He insulted and struck St. Philip Benizi, who, at the request of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, had gone to preach peace to the Forlivese. Peregrine's generous nature was immediately aroused by the mildness with which St. Philip received the attack and he begged the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> forgiveness. In 1283 he was received into the order, and so great was his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> it was only after much persuasion he consented to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. He founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in his native city, where he devoted all his energies to the restoration of peace. His <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and patience were so great that he was called by his people a second Job. He died in 1345. His body remains incorrupt to the present day. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> in 1726, and his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 30 April.

<p>One of the most remarkable features of the new foundation was its wonderful growth. Even in the thirteenth century there were houses of the order in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Early in the fourteenth century the order had more than one hundred <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> including branch houses in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>; there were also missions in Crete and <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. The disturbances during the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> caused the loss of many <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, but in the South of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the order met with much success. The Convent of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> in Via (1563) was the second house of the order established in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; San Marcello had been founded in 1369. Early in the eighteenth century the order sustained losses and confiscations from which it has scarcely yet recovered. The flourishing Province of Narbonne was almost totally destroyed by the plague which swept <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> in 1720. In 1783 the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a> were expelled from Prague and in 1785 <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecrated</a> the shrine of Maria Waldrast. Ten <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were suppressed in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 1835. A new foundation was made at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> in 1891, and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the College of St. Alexis was opened in 1895. At this period the order was introduced into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and America chiefly through the efforts of Fathers Bosio and Morini. The latter, having gone to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (1864) as director of the affiliated Sisters of Compassion, obtained charge of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> from <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Archbishop Manning</a> in 1867. His work prospered: besides St. Mary's Priory at <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> were opened at Bognor (1882) and Begbroke (1886). In 1870 Fathers Morini, Ventura, Giribaldi, and Brother Joseph Camera, at the request of Rt. Rev. Bishop Melcher of <a href="../cathen/06777a.htm">Green Bay</a>, took up a mission in America, at Neenah, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>. Father Morini founded at <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> (1874) the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Our Lady of Sorrows. A <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> was opened at Granville, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, in 1892. The American province, formally established in 1908, embraces <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, <a href="../cathen/14336a.htm">Superior</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04733c.htm">Denver</a>. In 1910 the order numbered 700 members in 62 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, of which 36 were in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 17 in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria-Hungary</a>, 4 in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 4 in North America, 1 in <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Devotions: manner of life</h2>

<p>In common with all <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders strictly so called, the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a> make solemn profession of the three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty, chastity, and obedience. The particular object of the order is to sanctify first its own members, and then all men through <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Mother of God</a>, especially in her desolation during the Passion of her <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Divine Son</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a> give missions, have the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, or teach in higher institutions of learning. The <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a> of the Seven Dolours is one of their devotions, as is also the <em>Via Matris</em>. The <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> of the order are <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>, <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, and the vigils of certain feasts. All offices in the order are elective and continue for three years, except that of general and assistant- generals which are for six years. The <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are: St. Philip Benizi (feast 23 Aug.), St. Peregrine Latiosi (30 April), <a href="../cathen/08556a.htm">St. Juliana Falconieri</a> (19 June), and the Seven Holy Founders (12 Feb.).
<h2 id="section3">Affiliated associations</h2>

<p>Connected with the first order of men are the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the second order, which originated with converts of St. Philip Benizi. These sisters have <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, The Tyrol, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The Mantellate, a third order of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> founded by <a href="../cathen/08555a.htm">St. Juliana</a> (see <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">SERVANTS OF MARY</a>), have houses in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> they are to be found in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/14016a.htm">Sioux City</a> and Belville. There is also a third order for seculars, as well as a confraternity of the Seven Dolours, branches of which may be erected in any church.
