<h1>Order of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military order</a> of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem originated in a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> founded in the twelfth century by the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> of the Latin Kingdom. Without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> there had been before this date <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> in the East, of which the Knights of St. Lazarus claimed to be the continuation, in order to have the appearance of remote antiquity and to pass as the oldest of all orders. But this pretension is <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>. These Eastern <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> followed the <a href="../cathen/02322a.htm">Rule of St. Basil</a>, while that of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> adopted the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a> in use in the West. The Order of St. Lazarus was indeed purely an order of hospitallers from the beginning, as was that of St. John, but without encroaching on the field of the latter. Because of its special aim, it had quite a different organization. The inmates of St. John were merely visitors, and changed constantly; the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> of St. Lazarus on the contrary were condemned to perpetual seclusion. In return they were regarded as brothers or sisters of the house which sheltered them, and they obeyed the common rule which united them with their religious guardians. In some <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> even the master had to be chosen from among the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>. It is not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, though it has been asserted, that this was the case at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> surrounded with a touching pity these the greatest of all unfortunates, these <em>miselli</em>, as they were called. From the time of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusades</a>, with the spread of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> became very numerous throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, so that at the death of St. Louis there were eight hundred in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> alone.

<p>However, these houses did not form a congregation; each house was autonomous, and supported to a great extent by the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> themselves, who were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> when entering to bring with them their implements, and who at their death willed their goods to the institution if they had no children. Many of these houses bore the name of St. Lazarus, from which, however, no dependence whatever on St. Lazarus of Jerusalem is to be inferred. The most famous, St. Lazarus of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, depended solely and directly on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city, and was a mere <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> when it was given by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> to the missionaries of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, who have retained the name of <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a> (1632).

<p>The question remains, how and at what time the Order of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem became a <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military order</a>. This is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> exactly; and, moreover, the historians of the order have done much to obscure the question by entangling it with gratuitous pretensions and suspicious documents.

<p>The house at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> owed to the general interest devoted to the holy places in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> a rapid and substantial growth in goods and privileges of every kind. It was endowed not only by the sovereigns of the Latin realm, but by all the states of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Louis VII, on his return from the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section2">Second Crusade</a>, gave it the Ch&acirc;teau of Broigny, near Orl&eacute;ans (1154). This example was followed by Henry II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a>. This was the origin of the military commanderies whose contributions, called responsions, flowed into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, swollen by the collections which the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> was authorized to make in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> for their part were not sparing of their favours. <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> recognized its existence under the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a> (1255). <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> assured it the same <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a> as were granted to the monastic orders (1262). <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> to confine all <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> whatsoever, men or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, religious or secular, in the houses of this order (1265).

<p>At the time these favours were granted, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> had fallen again into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulmans</a>. St. Lazarus, although still called "of Jerusalem", had been transferred to Acre, where it had been ceded territory by the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> (1240), and where it received the confirmation of its privileges by <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> (1264).

<p>It was at this time also that the Order of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem, following the example of the Order of St. John, armed combatants for the defence of the remaining possessions of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. Their presence is mentioned without further detail at the Battle of <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a> against the Khwarizmians in 1244, and at the final siege of Acre in 1291.

<p>As a result of this catastrophe the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem disappeared; however, its commanderies in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, together with their revenues, continued to exist, but hospitality was no longer practised. The order ceased to be an order of hospitallers and became purely military. The <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> who resided in these commanderies had no tasks, and were veritable parasites on the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charitable foundations.

<p>Things remained in this condition until the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>, who suppressed this useless order and transferred its possessions to the Knights of St. John (1490), which transfer was renewed by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Pope Julius II</a> (1505). But the Order of St. John never came into possession of this <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> except in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, to whom the Concordat of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> (1519) had resigned the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to the greater number of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>, evaded the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of suppression by conferring the commanderies of St. Lazarus on Knights of the Order of St. John. The last named vainly claimed the possession of these goods. Their claim was rejected by the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1547).

<p><a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> himself disregarded the value of this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> by re-establishing in favour of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, to which were attached the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> hospitallers of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> (1517).

<p><a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> went further; he annulled the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> of his predecessors and restored its possessions to the order that he might give the mastership to a favourite, Giovanni de Castiglione (1565). But the latter did not succeed in securing the devolution of the commanderies in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> codified the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> and privileges of the order, but reserved to himself the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to confirm the appointment of the grand master as well as of the beneficiaries (1567). He made an attempt to restore to the order its hospitaller character, by incorporating with it all the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and other houses founded under the patronage of St Lazarus of the Lepers. But this tardy reform was rendered useless by the subsequent gradual disappearance of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>.

<p>Finally, the grand mastership of the order having been rendered vacant in 1572 by the death of Castiglione, <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a> united it in perpetuity with the Crown of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. The reigning duke, Philibert III, hastened to fuse it with the recently founded Savoyan Order of <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a>, and thenceforth the title of Grand Master of the Order of Sts. Maurice and Lazarus was hereditary in that house. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> gave him authority over the vacant commanderies everywhere, except in the states of the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, which included the greater part of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> these commanderies had been suppressed by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> remained, but it was refractory to the claims of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. Some years later King Henry IV, having founded with the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> (1609) the Order of Notre-Dame du Mont-Carmel, hastened in turn to unite to it the vacant possessions of St. Lazarus in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and such is the origin of the title of "Knight of the Royal, Military, and Hospitaller Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and St. Lazarus of Jerusalem", which carried with it the enjoyment of a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, and which was conferred by the king for services rendered.

<p>To return to the dukes of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>: <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> granted them the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to exact from <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> pensions to the sum of four hundred crowns for the benefit of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> of the order, dispensing them from <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> on condition that they should observe the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the order and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> their arms to the defence of the Faith. Besides their commanderies the order had two houses where the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> might live in common, one of which, at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, was to contribute to combats on land, while the other, at <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Nice</a>, had to provide galleys to fight the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> at sea. But when thus reduced to the states of the Duke of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, the order merely vegetated until the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, which suppressed it. In 1816 the King of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, Victor Emmanuel I, re-established the titles of Knight and Commander of Sts. Maurice and Lazarus, as simple decorations, accessible without conditions of birth to both civilians and military men.
