<h1>Order of the Knights of Christ</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military order</a> which sprang out of the famous Order of the Temple (see <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Knights Templars</a>). As <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> was the first country in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> where the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> settled (in 1128), so it has been the last to preserve any remnant of that order. The Portuguese <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> had contributed to the conquest of Algarve from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a>; they were still defending that conquest when their order was suppressed (1312) by <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Pope Clement V</a>. King Diniz, who then ruled <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, regretted the loss of these useful auxiliaries all the more because, in the trial to which the order had been submitted everywhere throughout <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> had been declared innocent by the <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical court</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>. To fill their place, the king instituted a new order, under the name of <em>Christi Militia</em> (1317). He then obtained for this order the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a>, who, by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> (1319), gave these <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> the rule of the Knights of Calatrava (see Calatrava, Military Order of) and put them under the control of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Alcobaca. Further, by another <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> (1323), the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> authorized King Diniz to turn over to the new Order of Christ the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> estates of the suppressed <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a>, and, as many of the latter hastened to become Knights of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it may fairly be said that the foundation of Dom Diniz was both in its personnel and in its territorial position a continuation in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> of the Order of the Temple. Seated first at Castro Marino, it was later (1357) definitively established in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Thomar, near <a href="../cathen/13459c.htm">Santarem</a>.

<p>By this time, however, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> had rid its soil of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a>, and it seemed that the Order of Christ must waste its strength in idleness, when Prince Henry, the Navigator, son of King Jo&atilde;o I, opened a new field for its usefulness by carrying the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> into <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. The conquest of Ceuta (1415) was the first step towards the formation of a great Portuguese empire beyond the seas. It may at present be taken as demonstrated, that the motive of this great enterprise was not mercenary, but religious, its aim being the conquest of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> for Christ and His Faith. Nothing could have been more in accord with the spirit of the order, which, under Prince Henry himself as its grand master (1417-65), took up the plan with enthusiasm. This explains the extraordinary favours granted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> to the order &#151; favours intended to encourage a work of evangelization. <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> the text of which is lost, granted to Prince Henry, as Grand Master of the Order of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12399a.htm">right of presentation</a> to all <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> to be founded beyond the seas, together with complete <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and the disposal of church revenues in those regions. Naturally, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of these early foreign missions were recruited by preference from those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who were members of the order, and in 1514, a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> confirmed to it the <a href="../cathen/12399a.htm">right of presentation</a> to all <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> beyond the seas, from which a privilege afterwards arose the custom by which incumbents of such sees wear pectoral crosses of the form peculiar to the Order of Christ. After this campaign King Manoel of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, in order to overcome the repugnance of the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> to remaining in African garrisons, established thirty new commanderies in the conquered territory. <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, in order to further increase the number of the order's establishments, granted an annual income of 20,000 cruzadas to be derived from <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, and, as a result of all this material assistance, the total of seventy commanderies of the order at the beginning of Manoel's reign had become four hundred and fifty-four at its end, in 1521.

<p>While these foreign expeditions kept alive the military spirit of the order, its religious discipline was declining. <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Pope Alexander VI</a>, in 1492, commuted the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> to that of conjugal chastity, alleging the prevalence among the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a> to which regular marriage would be far preferable. The order was becoming less monastic and more secular, and was taking on more and more the character of a royal institution. After Prince Henry the Navigator, the grand mastership was always held by a royal prince; under Manoel it became definitively, with those of Aviz and Santiago, a prerogative of the crown; Jo&atilde;o III, Manoel's successor, instituted a special council (<em>Mesa das Ordens</em>) for the government of these orders in the king's name. Brother Antonius of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, in attempting a reform, succeeded in bringing about the complete annihilation of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> among the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> of the order. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Order of Christ were compelled to resume conventual life at Thomar, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> itself becoming a regular <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> with which the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> thenceforward maintained only a remote connection. This unwholesome change the young king, Dom Sebastian, tried to reverse (1574), but the glorious, though useless, death, in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, of the last of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> (1578) prevented the accomplishment of his design. During the period of Spanish domination (1580-1640), another attempt to revive the monastic character of the whole order resulted in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> enacted by a general chapter, at Thomar in 1619, and <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by Philip IV of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in 1627. The three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> were re-established, even for <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> not living in houses of the order, though with certain mitigations, marriage, for instance, being permitted to those who could obtain a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. The conditions of admission were noble birth and either two years' service in Africa or three years with the fleet, but commanderies could be held only by those who had served three years in Africa or five years with the fleet.

<p>The last attempt at a reform of the order was that of the Queen Donna Maria, made with the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> (1789). This, the most important of all the schemes of reformation designed for the order's benefit, made the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Thomar once more the headquarters of the whole order, and instead of the conventual prior, who, since 1551, had been elected by his bretheren for a term of three years, there was a grand <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the order, acknowledged by all classes and invested with all the privileges and the whole <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> formerly granted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. The sovereign, however, remained grand master, and the last Grand Priors of the Order of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as official subordinates of the Crown, did not fail to enter into the political entanglements of the nineteenth century. The last of all, Furtado de Mendoca, was identified with the Miguelist party in the troubles of 1829-32, and it was in the general confiscation of monastic <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> following the defeat of Dom Miguel that the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Thomar and four hundred and fifty commanderies were lost. The King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> is still officially "Grand Master of the Order of Our Lord Jesus Christ", and as such confers titular membership in the order, with the decoration of the crimson cross charged with another, smaller, cross of white.

<p>The Order of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decoration, or order of merit, is also a historical survival of the right, anciently reserved to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, of admitting new members into the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> order. (See Decorations, Papal.)
