<h1>Orders of St. Anthony</h1>  

<p>Religious communities or orders under the patronage of <a href="../cathen/01553d.htm">Anthony the Hermit</a>, father of <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monasticism</a>, or professing to follow his rule.
<h2 id="section1">Disciples of St. Anthony (Antonians)</h2>

<p>Men drawn to his hermitage in the <a href="../cathen/14561a.htm">Thebaid</a> by the fame of his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and forming the first monastic communities. Having changed his abode for the sake of solitude, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was again surrounded by followers (according to Rufinus, 6,000), living apart or in common. These he guided solely by his word and example. The rule bearing his name was compiled from his letters and <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>. There are still in the Orient a number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> claiming St. Anthony's rule, but in reality their rules date no further back than <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> Antonians were divided into two congregations called respectively St. Isaiah and St. Eliseus, or St. Anthony. Their constitutions were approved by <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a>, the former in 1740, the latter in 1732. The former has 19 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and 10 hospices; the latter, which has been subdivided, 10 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and 8 hospices under the Aleppo branch, and 31 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and 27 hospices under the Baladite branch.
<h2 id="section2">Antonines (Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony)</h2>

<p>A congregation founded by a certain Gaston of Dauphin&eacute; (c. 1095) and his son, in thanksgiving for <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> relief from "St. Anthony's fire," a disease then epidemic. Near the Church of St. Anthony at Saint-Didier de la Mothe they built a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, which became the central house of the order. The members devoted themselves to the care of the sick, particularly those afflicted with the disease above mentioned, they wore a black habit with the Greek letter <em>Tau</em> (St. Anthony's cross) in blue. At first <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, they received <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> from <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> (1218), and were constituted canons regular with the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a> by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> (1297). The congregation spread through <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and gave the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a number of distinguished scholars and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. Among their privileges was that of caring for the sick of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> household. With wealth came relaxation of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> and a reform was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> (1616) and partially carried out. In 1777 the congregation was canonically united with the Knights of Malta but was suppressed during the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>.
<h2 id="section3">Antonians</h2>

<p>A congregation of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> founded during the seventeenth century at the time of the persecutions of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>. Abram Atar Poresigh retired to the Libanus with three companions, and founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Most Holy Saviour under the protection of St. Anthony, to supply members for mission work. A second foundation was made on Mount Lebanon, and a third in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1753), which was approved by <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a>. Some members of this congregation took an unfortunately prominent part in the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Schism (1870-80).
<h2 id="section4">Congregation of St. Anthony</h2>

<p>Founded in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> in 1615, and placed under the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">rule of St. Augustine</a> by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, and under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Augustinians. The one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was called Castelletum.
<h2>Chaldean Antonians</h2>

<p>Of the Congregation of Saint-Homisdas, founded by Gabriel Dambo (1809) in Mesopotamia. They have 4 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> and several <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and stations.
