<h1>Orders of St. George</h1>  

<p>Knights of <a href="../cathen/06453a.htm">St. George</a> appear at different historical periods and in different countries as mutually independent bodies having nothing in common but the veneration of St. George, the patron of knighthood. St. George of <a href="../cathen/09468b.htm">Lydda</a>, a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> in the fourth century, is one of those military <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> whom Byzantine iconography represented as a horseman armed cap-&agrave;-pie, like the flower of the Roman armies after the military reform of Justinian in the sixth century. The pilgrim <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, encountering in the East these representations of St. George, recognized their own accoutrements and at once adopted him as the patron of their noble calling. This popularity of St. George in the West gave rise to numerous associations both secular and religious. Among secular orders of this name which still exist must be mentioned the English Order of the Garter, which has always had St. George for its patron. Though <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> suppressed his cult, the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. George at <a href="../cathen/15654a.htm">Windsor</a> has remained the official seat of the order, where its chapters assemble and where each <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> is entitled to a stall over which his banner is hung. A second royal order under the double patronage of <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael</a> and St. George was founded in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1818 to reward services rendered in foreign or colonial relations. In <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> a secular Order of St. George has existed since 1729, and owes its foundation to the prince elector, better known by the title of Charles VII which he bore as emperor for a brief period. The present Russian Order of St. George dates from 1769, having been founded in the reign of Catherine II, as a military distinction.

<p>There formerly existed regular orders of St. George. The <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Kingdom of Aragon</a> was placed under his patronage, and in gratitude for his assistance to its armies King Pedro II founded (1201) the Order of St. George of Alfama in the district of that name. Nevertheless this order received the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> only in 1363 and had but a brief existence. With the approval of <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> it was amalgamated with the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragonese</a> <a href="../cathen/10534a.htm">Order of Montesa</a>, and thereafter known as the <a href="../cathen/10534a.htm">Order of Montesa</a> and St. George of Alfama. Equally short-lived was the Order of St. George founded in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> by the Emperor Frederick III and approved by <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> in 1464. This needy prince was unable to assure a sufficient endowment for the support of his <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> gave him permission to transfer to the new order the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of a commandery of St. John and a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in the town of Milestadt, to which the emperor added some <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in his patronage. Nevertheless the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> had to rely for support on their personal possession, therefore they did not make a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty, but simply of obedience and chastity, and, owing to this lack of resources, the order did not survive its founder. It was succeeded by a secular Confraternity of St. George founded under the Emperor Maximilian I with the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> in 1494, which likewise disappeared, in the disturbances of the sixteenth century.
