<h1>Ordinary</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>ordinarius</em>, i. e., <em>judex</em>)

<p>An Ordinary in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> language, denotes any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> possessing or exercising ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, i.e., <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> connected permanently or at least in a stable way with an office, whether this connexion arises from <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or from positive church law, as in the case mentioned below.
Ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is contrasted with delegated <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, a temporary communication of power made by a superior to an inferior; thus we speak of a delegated judge and an ordinary judge. A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may be an ordinary within his own sphere, and at the same time have delegated powers for certain acts or the exercise of special authority. The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> which constitutes an ordinary is real and full <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the external forum, comprising the power of legislating, adjudicating, and governing. Jurisdiction in the internal forum, being partial and exercised only in private matters, does not constitute an ordinary. Parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, therefore, are not ordinaries, though they have <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the internal forum, for they have not <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the external forum, being incapable of legislating and acting as judges; their administration is the exercise of paternal authority rather than of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> properly so called.

<p>There are various classes of ordinaries. First, they are divided into those having territorial <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and those who have not. As a rule ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is territorial as well as personal, as in the case of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; but ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> may be restricted to certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, exempt from the local authority. Such for instance is the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of regular <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, generals, and <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders making solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>; they can legislate, adjudicate and govern; consequently they are ordinaries; but their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> concerns <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> not localities; they are not, like the others, called local ordinaries, <em>ordinarii locorum</em>. Superiors of congregations and institutes bound by simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are not ordinaries though they may enjoy a greater or less degree of administrative exemption. The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of local ordinaries arises from <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a> or ecclesiastical law. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is the ordinary of the entire church and all the faithful; he has ordinary and immediate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over all (Conc. Vatic., Const. "Pastor &aelig;ternus", c. iii). Bishops are the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and ordinary judges in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, appointed to govern their churches by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> (<a href="../bible/act020.htm#vrs28">Acts 20:28</a>). Certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have, by ecclesiastical law, a mediate ordinary power over other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>; these are the metropolitana, <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>. In a lower rank, there is another class of ordinaries, viz., <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who exercise <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the external forum over a given territory, which is not a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, either in their own name, as in the case of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> or <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> <em>nullius</em> or in the name of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, like years and prefects Apostolic until the erection of their territories into complete <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>.

<p>Local ordinaries being unable personally to perform all acts of their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> may and even ought to communicate it permanently to certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, without however, divesting themselves of their authority; if the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are specified and determined by law, they also are ordinaries, but in a restricted and inferior sense. This is vicarial <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, delegated as to its source, but ordinary as to its exercise, and which would be more accurately termed quasi-ordinary. In this sense vicars-general and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> officials are ordinaries; so also, in regard to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the heads of the various organs of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> are ordinaries for the whole Church; the cardinal vicar for the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and his district; the <em>legate a latere</em>, for the country to which he is sent. Finally, there are ordinaries with an interimary and transitory title during the vacancy of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. Thus when the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is vacant, the ordinaries are the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/03217a.htm">camerlengo</a>; when a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> the chapter and also the <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a>, and in general the interimary administrator; so, too, the vicar, for <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. These <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> possess and exercise exterior <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, although with certain restrictions, and this in virtue of their office; they are therefore ordinaries.

<p>In practice, the determination of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> included under the term ordinary is of importance in the case of <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a> and the execution of <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescripts</a> issued from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Since the decrees of the Holy Office <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 20 February, 1888, and 20 April, 1898, <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a> and most of the <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescripts</a>, instead of being addressed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, are addressed to the ordinary; and it has been declared that the term ordinary comprises <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Apostolic administrators, vicars, <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> or prefects with separate territorial <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and their officials or vicars-general; and also, during the vacancy of a see, the <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a> or lawful administrator. Thus the powers are handed on, without intermission or renewal, from one ordinary to his successor. (See JURISDICTION.)
