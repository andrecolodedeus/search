<h1>Orientation of Churches</h1>  

<p>According to <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of his time were, by some who concerned themselves with their form of worship, believed to votaries of the sun. This supposition, he adds, doubtless arose from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> practice of turning to the east when <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> (Apol., c. xvi). Speaking of churches the same writer tells us that the homes "of our dove", as he terms them, are always in "high and open places, facing the light" (Adv. Val., c. iii), and the Apostolic Constitutions (third to fifth century) prescribe that church edifices should be erected with their "heads" towards the East (Const. Apost., II, 7).

<p>The practice of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> while turned towards the rising sun is older than <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in adopting it were influenced by reasons peculiar to themselves. The principal of these reasons, according to <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a>, was that the Orient contained man's original home, the earthly <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a>. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, speaking for the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, adds to this reason several others, as for example, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> lived His earthly life in the East, and that from the East He shall come to judge <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> (II-II, Q. lxxxiv, a. 3). Thus from the earliest period the custom of locating the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> and altar in the eastern extremity of the church was the rule. Yet the great Roman Basilicas of the Lateran, St. Peter's, <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul's</a> (originally), St. Lorenzo's, as well as the Basilica of the Resurrection in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and Antioch, reversed this rule by placing the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> in the western extremity. The reasons for this mode of orientation can only be conjectured. Some writers explain it by the fact that in the fourth century the celebrant at Mass faced the people, and, therefore in a church with a western <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>, looked towards the East when officiating at the altar. Others conjecture that the peculiar orientation of the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> mentioned, erected by <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> or under his influence, may have been a reminiscence of the former predilection of this emperor for sun-worship. In the Orient the eastern <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> was the rule, and thence it made its way to the West through the reconstructed <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">Basilica of St. Paul's</a>, the Basilica of S. Pietro in Vincoli, and the celebrated basilica of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. From the eighth century the propriety of the eastern <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> was universally admitted, though, of course strict adherence to this <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> canon, owing to the direction of city streets, was not always possible.
