<h1>Oriflamme</h1>  

<p>In verses 3093-5 of the "Chanson de Roland" (eleventh century) the oriflamme is mentioned as a royal banner, called at first "Romaine" afterwards "Montjoie". According to the legend it was given to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but no historical text affords us any information with regard to this oriflamme, which is perhaps fabulous. As Eudes, who became king in 888, was <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Martin, the banner of the church of <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a> was the earliest military standard of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> monarchy. It was a plain blue, a colour then assigned in the liturgy to <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who were, like St. Martin, confessors and pontiffs. The azure ground strewn with gold fleur-de-lis remained the symbol of royalty until the fourteenth century, when the white standard of <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Jeanne d'Arc</a> wrought marvels, and by degrees the custom was introduced of depicting the fleur-de-lis on white ground. But from the time of Louis VI (1108-37) the banner of St. Martin was replaced as ensign of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> by the oriflamme of the <a href="../cathen/13343b.htm">Abbey of St. Denis</a>, which floated about the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of St. Denis and was said to have been given to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> by Dagobert. It is supposed without any <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that this was a piece of fiery red silk of <em>sendal</em> the field of which was covered with flames and stars of gold. The standard-bearer carried it either at the end of a staff or suspended from his neck. Until the twelfth century the standard-bearer was the Comte de Vexin, who, as "vowed" to St. Denis, was the temporal defender of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Louis VI the Fat, having acquired Vexin, became standard-bearer; as soon as <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> began, Louis VI received Communion at St. Denis and took the standard from the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> to carry it to the combat. "Montjoie Saint Denis", cried the men-at-arms, even as in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> they cried "Montjoie Notre Dame", or "Montjoie Saint George". The word <em>Montjoie</em> (<em>from Mons gaudii</em> or <em>Mons Jovis</em>) designates the heaps of stones along the roadside which served as mile-stones or as sign-posts, and which sometimes became the meeting-places for warriors; it was applied to the oriflamme the sight of which was to guide the soldiers into the m&#234;l&eacute;e. The descriptions of the oriflamme which have reached us in Guillaume le Breton (thirteenth century), in the "Chronicle of Flanders" (fourteenth century), in the "Registra Delphinalia" (1456), and in the inventory of the treasury of St. Denis (1536), show that to the primitive oriflamme there succeeded in the course of centuries newer oriflammes which little resembled one another. At the battle of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a> (1356) and Agincourt (1415) the oriflamme fell into the hands of the English; it would seem that after the Hundred Years' War it was no longer borne on the battlefield.
