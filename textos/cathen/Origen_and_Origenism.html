<h1>Origen and Origenism</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Life and work of Origen</h2>
<h3 id="A">Biography</h3>

<p>Origen, most modest of writers, hardly ever alludes to himself in his own works; but <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> has devoted to him almost the entire sixth book of "Ecclesiastical History". <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> was thoroughly acquainted with the life of his hero; he had collected a hundred of his letters; in collaboration with the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> <a href="../cathen/11436b.htm">Pamphilus</a> he had composed the "Apology for Origen"; he dwelt at Caesarea where Origen's <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was preserved, and where his memory still lingered; if at times he may be thought somewhat partial, he is undoubtedly well informed. We find some details also in the "Farewell Address" of <a href="../cathen/07015a.htm">St. Gregory Thaumaturgus</a> to his master, in the controversies of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and Rufinus, in <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> (Haeres., LXIV), and in Photius (Biblioth. Cod. 118).
<h3 id="A">Origen at Alexandria (185-232)</h3>

<p>Born in 185, Origen was barely seventeen when a bloody <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Alexandrian broke out. His father Leonides, who admired his precocious genius was charmed with his virtuous life, had given him an excellent literary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. When Leonides was cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, Origen would fain have shared his lot, but being unable to carry out his resolution, as his mother had hidden his clothes, he wrote an ardent, enthusiastic letter to his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> exhorting him to persevere <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a>. When Leonides had won the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> crown and his fortune had been confiscated by the imperial authorities, the heroic child laboured to support himself, his mother, and his six younger brothers. This he successfully accomplished by becoming a teacher, selling his <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, and by the generous aid of a certain rich lady, who admired his talents. He assumed, of his own accord, the direction of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, on the withdrawal of Clement, and in the following year was confirmed in his office by the patriarch Demetrius (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.2</a>; <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, "De viris illust.", liv). Origen's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which was frequented by <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, soon became a nursery of <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a>, confessors, and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Among the latter were Plutarch, Serenus, Heraclides, Heron, another Serenus, and a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumen</a>, Herais (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.4</a>). He accompanied them to the scene of their victories encouraging them by his exhortations. There is nothing more touching than this picture <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> has drawn of Origen's youth, so studious, disinterested, austere and pure, ardent and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> even to indiscretion (VI, iii and vi). Thrust thus at so early an age into the teacher's chair, he recognized the necessity of completing his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Frequenting the philosophic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, especially that of Ammonius Saccas, he devoted himself to a study of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, particularly <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>. In this he was but following the example of his predecessors Pantenus and Clement, and of Heracles, who was to succeed him. Afterwards, when the latter shared his labours in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, he learned Hebrew, and communicated frequently with certain <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who helped him to solve his difficulties.

<p>The course of his work at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> was interrupted by five journeys. About 213, under <a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Pope Zephyrinus</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03328c.htm">emperor Caracalla</a>, he desired "to see the very ancient Church of Rome", but he did not remain there long (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.14</a>). Shortly afterwards he was invited to Arabia by the governor who was desirous of meeting him (VI, xix). It was probably in 215 or 216 when the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/03328c.htm">Caracalla</a> was raging in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> that he visited Palestine, where Theoctistus of Caesarea and <a href="../cathen/01295b.htm">Alexander of Jerusalem</a>, invited him to preach though he was still a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. Towards 218, it would appear, the empress Mammaea, mother of <a href="../cathen/13743a.htm">Alexander Severus</a>, brought him to Antioch (VI, xxi). Finally, at a much later period, under  Pontian of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Zebinus of Antioch (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, VI, xxiii), he journeyed into <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, passing through Caesarea where Theoctistus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of that city, assisted by Alexander, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, raised him to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Demetrius, although he had given letters of recommendation to Origen, was very much offended by this <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, which had taken place without his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and, as he thought, in derogation of his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. If <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (VI, viii) is to be believed, he was <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of the increasing influence of his catechist. So, on his return to <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, Origen soon perceived that his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was rather unfriendly towards him. He yielded to the storm and quitted <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (231). The details of this affair were recorded by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> in the lost second book of the "Apology for Origen"; according to Photius, who had read the work, two councils were held at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, one of which pronounced a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of banishment against Origen while the other deposed him from the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> (Biblioth. cod. 118). <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> declares expressly that he was not condemned on a point of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>.
<h3 id="B">Origen at Caesarea (232)</h3>

<p>Expelled from <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, Origen fixed his abode at Caesarea in Palestine (232), with his protector and friend Theoctistus, founded a new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> there, and resumed his "Commentary on St. John" at the point where it had been interrupted. He was soon surrounded by pupils. The most distinguished of these, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, was <a href="../cathen/07015a.htm">St. Gregory Thaumaturgus</a> who, with his brother Apollodorus, attended Origen's lectures for five years and delivered on leaving him a celebrated "Farewell Address". During the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Maximinus (235-37) Origen visited his friend, St. Firmilian, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">Caesarea</a> in Cappadocia, who made him remain for a long period. On this occasion he was hospitably entertained by a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> lady of Caesarea, named Juliana, who had inherited the writing of Symmachus, the translator of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> (Palladius, "Hist. Laus.", 147). The years following were devoted almost uninterruptedly to the composition of the "Commentaries". Mention is made only of a few excursions to Holy Places, a journey to Athens (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, VI, xxxii), and two voyages to <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabia</a>, one of which was undertaken for the conversion of Beryllus, a <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Patripassian</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, VI, xxxiii; <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, <a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 60</a>), the other to refute certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who denied the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.37</a>). Age did not diminish his activities. He was over sixty when he wrote his <a href="../fathers/0416.htm">"Contra Celsum"</a> and his "Commentary on St. Matthew". The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a> (250) prevented him from continuing these works. Origen was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and barbarously tortured, but his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> was unshaken and from his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> he wrote letters breathing the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.39</a>). He was still alive on the death of <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a> (251), but only lingering on, and he died, probably, from the results of the sufferings endured during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> (253 or 254), at the age of sixty-nine (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.1</a>). His last days were spent at Tyr, though his reason for retiring thither is unknown. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> as a confessor of the Faith. For a long time his sepulchre, behind the high-altar of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Tyr, was visited by <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. Today, as nothing remains of this <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> except a mass of ruins, the exact location of his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> is unknown.


<h3 id="B">Works</h3>

<p>Very few authors were as fertile as Origen. <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> estimates at six thousand the number of his writings, counting separately, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, the different books of a single work, his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, letters, and his smallest treatises (Haeres., LXIV, lxiii). This figure, repeated by many <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers, seems greatly exaggerated. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> assures us that the list of Origen's writings drawn up by St. Pamphilus did not contain even two thousand titles (Contra Rufin., II, xxii; III, xxiii); but this list was evidently incomplete. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.32</a>) had inserted it in his biography of St. Pamphilus and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> inserted it in a letter to Paula.
<h3 id="A">Exegetical writings</h3>

<p>Origen had devoted three kinds of works to the explanation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>: commentaries, <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, and scholia (St. Jerome, "Prologus interpret. homiliar. Orig. in Ezechiel"). The commentaries (<em>tomoi libri, volumina</em>) were a continuous and well-developed interpretation of the inspired text. An <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of their magnitude may be formed from the fact that the words of St. John: "In the beginning was the Word", furnished material for a whole roll. There remain in Greek only eight books of the "Commentary on St. Matthew", and nine books of the "Commentary on St. John"; in Latin an anonymous translation of the "Commentary on St. Matthew" beginning with chapter xvi, three books and a half of the "Commentary on the Canticle of Canticles" translated by Rufinus, and an abridgment of the "Commentary on the Epistles to the Romans" by the same translator. The <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> (<em>homiliai, homiliae, tractatus</em>) were familiar discourses on texts of Scripture, often extemporary and recorded as well as possible by stenographers. The list is long and undoubtedly must have been longer if it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that Origen, as St. Pamphilus declares in his "Apology" preached almost every day. There remain in Greek twenty-one (twenty on Jeremias and the celebrated <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> on the <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witch</a> of Endor); in Latin, one hundred and eighteen translated by Rufinus, seventy-eight translated by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and some others of more of less <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> authenticity, preserved in a collection of <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>. The twenty "Tractatus Origenis" recently discovered are not the work of Origen, though use has been made of his writings. Origen has been called the father of the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a>; it was he who contributed most to popularize this species of literature in which are to be found so many instructive details on the customs of the primitive Church, its institutions, discipline, liturgy, and <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. The scholia (<em>scholia, excerpta, commaticum interpretandi genus</em>) were <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a>, philological, or historical notes, on words or passages of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, like the annotations of the Alexandria grammarians on the profane writers. Except some few short fragments all of these have perished.
<h3>Other writings</h3>

<p>We now possess only two of Origen's letters: one addressed to <a href="../cathen/07015a.htm">St. Gregory Thaumaturgus</a> on the reading of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, the other to <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Julius Africanus</a> on the Greek additions to the Book of Daniel. Two <em>opuscula</em> have been preserved entire in the original form; an excellent treatise "On Prayer" and an "Exhortation to Martyrdom", sent by Origen to his friend <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, then a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> for the Faith. Finally two large works have escaped the ravages of time: the <a href="../fathers/0416.htm">"Contra Celsum"</a> in the original text, and the <a href="../fathers/0412.htm">"De principiis"</a> in a Latin translation by Rufinus and in the citations of the "Philocalia" which might equal in contents one-sixth of the whole work. In the eight books of the <a href="../fathers/0416.htm">"Contra Celsum"</a> Origen follows his adversary point by point, refuting in detail each of his <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> imputations. It is a model of reasoning, erudition, and honest polemic. The <a href="../fathers/0412.htm">"De principiis"</a>, composed at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, and which, it seems, got into the hands of the public before its completion, treated successively in its four books, allowing for numerous digressions, of: (a) <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Trinity, (b) the world and its relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, (c) man and his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, (d) Scripture, its inspiration and interpretation. Many other works of Origen have been entirely lost: for instance, the treatise in two books "On the Resurrection", a treatise "On Free Will", and ten books of "Miscellaneous Writings" (<em>Stromateis</em>). For Origen's critical work see <a href="../cathen/07316a.htm">HEXAPLA</a>.
<h3 id="C">Posthumous influence of Origen</h3>

<p>During his lifetime Origen by his writings, teaching, and intercourse exercised very great influence. St. Firmilian of Caesarea in Cappadocia, who regarded himself as his disciple, made him remain with him for a long period to profit by his learning (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.26</a>; <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a>, "Hist. Laus.", 147). <a href="../cathen/01295b.htm">St. Alexander of Jerusalem</a> his fellow pupil at the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was his intimate faithful friend (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, VI, xiv), as was Theoctistus of Caesarea in Palestine, who <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> him (<a href="../cathen/12043b.htm">Photius</a>, cod. 118). Beryllus of <a href="../cathen/02707a.htm">Bostra</a>, whom he had won back from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, was deeply attached to him (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, VI, xxxiii; <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, <a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 60</a>). St. Anatolus of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> sang his praises in his "Carmen Paschale" (P.G., X, 210). The learned <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Julius Africanus</a> consulted him, Origen's reply being extant (P.G., XI, 41-85). <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus</a> highly appreciated his talents (St. Jerome, <a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 61</a>). St. Dionysius, his pupil and successor in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, when <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, dedicated to him his treatise "On the Persecution" (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, VI, xlvi), and on learning of his death wrote a letter filled with his praises (<a href="../cathen/12043b.htm">Photius</a>, cod. 232). <a href="../cathen/07015a.htm">St. Gregory Thaumaturgus</a>, who had been his pupil for five years at <a href="../cathen/03133b.htm">Caesarea</a>, before leaving addressed to him his celebrated "Farewell Address" (P.G., X, 1049-1104), an enthusiastic panegyric. There is no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that Heracles, his disciple, colleague, and successor in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, before being raised to the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, wavered in his sworn friendship. Origen's name was so highly esteemed that when there was a question of putting an end to a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> or rooting out a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, appeal was made to it.

<p>After his death his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> continued to spread. St. Pamphilus, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in 307, composes with <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> an "Apology for Origen" in six books the first alone of which has been preserved in a Latin translation by Rufinus (P.G., XVII, 541-616). Origen had at that time many other apologists whose names are unknown to us (<a href="../cathen/12043b.htm">Photius</a>, cod. 117 and 118). The directors of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> continued to walk in his footsteps. Theognostus, in his "Hypotyposes", followed him even too closely, according to Photius (cod. 106), though his action was approved by <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>. Pierius was called by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> "Origenes junior" (<a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 76</a>). Didymus the Blind composed a work to explain and justify the teaching of the <a href="../fathers/0412.htm">"De principiis"</a> (St. Jerome, "Adv. Rufin.", I, vi). St. Athanasius does not hesitate to cite him with praise (Epist. IV ad Serapion., 9 and 10) and points out that he must be interpreted generously (De decretis Nic., 27).

<p>Nor was the admiration for the great Alexandrian less outside of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a> gave significant expression to his opinion (Suidas, "Lexicon", ed. Bernhardy, II, 1274: <em>Origenes he panton hemon achone</em>). In collaboration with <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, he had published, under the title "Philocalia", a volume of selections from the master. In his "Panegyric on St. Gregory Thaumaturgus", <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a> called Origen the prince of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> learning in the third century (P.G., XLVI, 905). At Caesarea in Palestine the admiration of the learned for Origen became a passion. St. Pamphilus wrote his "Apology", Euzoius had his writings transcribed on parchment (St. Jerome, <a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 93</a>). <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> catalogued them carefully and drew upon them largely. Nor were the Latins less enthusiastic than the Greeks. According to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, the principal Latin imitators of Origen are <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">St. Eusebius of Verceil</a>, <a href="../cathen/07349b.htm">St. Hilary of Poitiers</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose of Milan</a>; <a href="../cathen/15414a.htm">St. Victorinus</a> of Pettau had set them the example (St. Jerome, "Adv. Rufin.", I, ii; "Ad Augustin. Epist.", cxii, 20). Origen's writings were so much drawn upon that the solitary of Bethlehem called it plagiarism, <em>furta Latinarum</em>. However, excepting Rufinus, who is practically only a translator, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> is perhaps the Latin writer who is most indebted to Origen. Before the Origenist controversies he willingly admitted this, and even afterwards, he did not entirely repudiate it; cf. the prologues to his translations of Origen (Homilies on St. Luke, Jeremias, and Ezechiel, the Canticle of Canticles), and also the prefaces to his own "Commentaries" (on Micheas, the Epistles to the Galatians, and to the Ephesians etc.).

<p>Amidst these expressions of admiration and praise, a few discordant voices were heard. St. Methodius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (311), had written several works against Origen, amongst others a treatise "On the Resurrection", of which <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> cites a long extract (Haeres., LXVI, xii-lxii). <a href="../cathen/05627b.htm">St. Eustathius</a> of Antioch, who died in exile about 337, criticized his allegorism (P.G., XVIII, 613-673). St. Alexander of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> in 311, also attacked him, if we are to credit <a href="../cathen/09179b.htm">Leontius of Byzantium</a> and the emperor Justinian. But his chief adversaries were the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, Sabellians, <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a>, <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarists</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Origenism</h2>

<p>By this term is understood not so much Origen's <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and the body of his teachings, as a certain number of doctrines, rightly or wrongly attributed to him, and which by their novelty or their danger called forth at an early period a refutation from <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> writers. They are chiefly: <ul><li>Allegorism in the interpretation of Scripture <li>Subordination of the Divine Persons <li>The theory of successive trials and a final restoration. </ul> Before examining how far Origen is responsible for these theories, a word must be said of the directive principle of his <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>.
<h3>The Church and the Rule of Faith</h3>

<p>In the preface to the <a href="../fathers/0412.htm">"De principiis"</a> Origen laid down a rule thus formulated in the translation of Rufinus: "Illa sola credenda est veritas quae in nullo ab ecclesiastica et apostolica discordat traditione". The same norm is expressed almost in equivalent terms n many other passages, e.g., "non debemus credere nisi quemadmodum per successionem Ecclesiae Dei tradiderunt nobis (In Matt., ser. 46, <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, XIII, 1667). In accordance with those principles Origen constantly appeals to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> preaching, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> teaching, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a> (<em>kanon</em>). He accepts only four Canonical Gospels because tradition does not receive more; he admits the necessity of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of infants because it is in accordance with the practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> founded on <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Apostolic tradition</a>; he warns the interpreter of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, not to rely on his own judgment, but "on the rule of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> instituted by Christ". For, he adds, we have only two lights to guide us here below, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> reflects faithfully the light received from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as the moon reflects the rays of the sun. The distinctive mark of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> is to belong to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to depend on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> outside of which there is no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; on the contrary, he who leaves the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> walks in darkness, he is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. It is through the principle of authority that Origen is wont to unmask and combat <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. It is the principle of authority, too, that he invokes when he enumerates the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. A man animated with such sentiments may have made mistakes, because he is human, but his disposition of mind is essentially <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and he does not deserve to be ranked among the promoters of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.
<h3 id="A">Scriptural allegorism</h3>

<p>The principal passages on the inspiration, meaning, and interpretation of the Scriptures are preserved in Greek in the first fifteen chapters of the "Philocalia". According to Origen, Scripture is inspired because it is the word and work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But, far from being an inert instrument, the inspired author has full possession of his faculties, he is conscious of what he is writing; he is physically free to deliver his message or not; he is not seized by a passing delirium like the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> oracles, for bodily disorder, disturbance of the senses, momentary loss of reason are but so many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the action of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirit</a>. Since Scripture is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it ought to have the distinctive characteristics of the Divine works: <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, unity, and fullness. The word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> cannot possibly be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>; hence no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> or contradictions can be admitted in Scripture (<a href="../fathers/101510.htm"><em>Commentary on John</em> X.3</a>). The author of the Scriptures being one, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> is less a collection of books than one and the same book (Philoc., V, iv-vii), a perfect harmonious instrument (Philoc., VI, i-ii). But the most Divine note of Scripture is its fullness: "There is not in the Holy Books the smallest passage (<em>cheraia</em>) but reflects the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (Philoc., I, xxviii, cf. X, i). True there are imperfections in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>: antilogies, repetitions, want of continuity; but these imperfections become perfections by leading us to the allegory and the spiritual meaning (Philoc., X, i-ii).

<p>At one time Origen, starting from the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> trichotomy, distinguishes the <em>body</em>, the <em><a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></em>, and the <em>spirit</em> of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>; at another, following a more rational terminology, he distinguishes only between the letter and the spirit. In reality, the <em><a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></em>, or the psychic signification, or <em>moral</em> meaning (that is the <em>moral</em> parts of Scripture, and the <em>moral applications</em> of the other parts) plays only a very secondary r&ocirc;le, and we can confine ourselves to the antithesis: <em>letter</em> (or <em>body</em>) and <em>spirit</em>. Unfortunately this antithesis is not free from equivocation. Origen does not understand by letter (or body) what we mean today by the literal sense, but the grammatical sense, the proper as opposed to the figurative meaning. Just so he does not attach to the words spiritual meaning the same signification as we do: for him they mean the spiritual sense properly so called (the meaning added to the literal sense by the express wish of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> attaching a special signification to the fact related or the manner of relating them), or the figurative as contrasted with the proper sense, or the accommodative sense, often an arbitrary invention of the interpreter, or even the literal sense when it is treating of things spiritual. If this terminology is kept in mind there is nothing absurd in the principle he repeats so often: "Such a passage of the Scripture as no corporal meaning." As examples Origen cites the <a href="../cathen/01558c.htm">anthropomorphisms</a>, metaphors, and symbols which ought indeed to be understood figuratively.

<p>Though he warns us that these passages are the exceptions, it must be confessed that he allows too many cases in which the Scripture is not to be understood according to the letter; but, remembering his terminology, his principle is unimpeachable. The two great rules of interpretation laid sown by the Alexandria catechist, taken by themselves and independently of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> applications, are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> against criticism. They may be formulated thus: <ul><li>Scripture must be interpreted in a manner worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the author of Scripture. <li>The corporal sense or the letter of Scripture must not be adopted, when it would entail anything impossible, absurd, or unworthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </ul>The abuse arises from the application of these rules. Origen has recourse too easily to allegorism to explain purely apparent antilogies or antinomies. He considers that certain narratives or ordinances of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> would be unworthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> if they had to be taken according to the letter, or if they were to be taken <em>solely</em> according to the letter. He justifies the allegorism by the fact that otherwise certain accounts or certain <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> now abrogated would be useless and profitless for the reader: a fact which appears to him contrary to the providence of the Divine inspirer and the dignity of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>. It will thus be seen that though the criticisms directed against his allegorical method by <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> and St. Methodius were not groundless, yet many of the complaints arise from a misunderstanding.
<h3 id="B">Subordination of the divine persons</h3>

<p>The three Persons of the Trinity are distinguished from all creatures by the three following characteristics: absolute immateriality, omniscience, and substantial <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. As is well known many ancient <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers attributed to created spirits an aerial or ethereal envelope without which they could not act. Though he does not venture to decide categorically, Origen inclines to this view, but, as soon as there is a question of the Divine Persons, he is perfectly sure that they have no body and are not in a body; and this characteristic belongs to the Trinity alone (<a href="../fathers/04124.htm"><em>De Principiis</em> IV.27</a>, <a href="../fathers/04121.htm">I.6</a>, <a href="../fathers/04122.htm">II.2.2</a>, <a href="../fathers/04122.htm">II.4.3</a>, etc.). Again the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of every creature, being essentially limited, is always imperfect and capable of being increased. But it would be repugnant for the Divine Persons to pass from the state of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. How could the Son, who is the Wisdom of the Father, be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of anything (<a href="../fathers/101501.htm"><em>Commentary on John</em> I.27</a>; <a href="../fathers/04166.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> VI.17</a>). Nor can we admit <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in the Spirit who "searcheth the deep things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../fathers/04121.htm"><em>De Principiis</em> I.5.4</a>, <a href="../fathers/04121.htm">I.6.2</a>, <a href="../fathers/04121.htm">I.7.3</a>; "In Num. him.", XI, 8 etc.). As substantial <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> is the exclusive privilege of the Trinity so also is it the only source of all created <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Sin is forgiven only by the simultaneous concurrence of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; no one is sanctified at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> save through their common action; the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in which the Holy Ghost indwells possesses likewise the Son and the Father. In a word the three Persons of the Trinity are indivisible in their being, their presence, and their operation.

<p>Along with these perfectly <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> texts there are some which must be interpreted with diligence, remembering as we ought that the language of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> was not yet fixed and that Origen was often the first to face these difficult problems. It will then appear that the subordination of the Divine Persons, so much urged against Origen, generally consists in differences of appropriation (the Father creator, the Son redeemer, the Spirit sanctifier) which seem to attribute to the Persons an unequal sphere of action, or in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> practice of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> the Father <em>through</em> the Son in the Holy Ghost, or in the theory so widespread in the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> of the first five centuries, that the Father has a pre-eminence of rank (<em>taxis</em>) over the two other Persons, inasmuch as in mentioning them He ordinarily has the first place, and of dignity (<em>axioma</em>) because He represents the whole Divinity, of which He is the principle (<em>arche</em>), the origin (<em>aitios</em>), and the source (<em>pege</em>). That is why St. Athanasius defends Origen's <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> concerning the Trinity and why St. Basil and <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a> replied to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who claimed the support of his authority that they misunderstood him.
<h3 id="C">The origin and destiny of rational beings</h3>

<p>Here we encounter an unfortunate amalgam of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The system that results is not coherent, for Origen, frankly recognizing the contradiction of the incompatible elements that he is trying to unify, recoils from the consequences, protests against the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> conclusions, and oftentimes corrects by <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> professions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heterodoxy</a> of his speculations. It must be said that almost all the texts about to be treated of, are contained in the <a href="../fathers/0412.htm">"De principiis"</a>, where the author treads on most dangerous ground. The system may be reduced to a few hypotheses, the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and danger of which were not recognized by Origen.

<p><em>(1) Eternity of Creation</em>

<p>Whatever exists outside of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was created by Him: the Alexandrian catechist always defended this thesis most energetically against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who admitted an uncreated matter (<a href="../fathers/04122.htm"><em>De Principiis</em> II.1.5</a>; "In Genes.", I, 12, in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, XII, 48-9). But he believes that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> created from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, for "it is absurd", he says, "to imagine the <a href="../cathen/06612a.htm">nature of God</a> inactive, or His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> inefficacious, or His dominion without subjects" (<a href="../fathers/04123.htm"><em>De Principiis</em> III.5.3</a>). Consequently he is forced to admit a double <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> series of worlds before and after the present world.

<p><em>(2) Original Equality of the Created Spirits</em>.

<p>"In the beginning all <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> natures were created equal and alike, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had no motive for creating them otherwise" (<a href="../fathers/04122.htm"><em>De Principiis</em> II.9.6</a>). Their present differences arise solely from their different use of the gift of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. The spirits created good and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> grew tired of their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> (op. cit., I, iii, 8), and, though carelessness, fell, some more some less (I, vi, 2). Hence the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; hence also the four categories of created intellects: <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, stars (supposing, as is probable, that they are animated, <a href="../fathers/04121.htm"><em>De Principiis</em> I.7.3</a>), men, and demons. But their r&ocirc;les may be one day changed; for what <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> has done, <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> can undo, and the Trinity alone is essentially immutable in good.

<p><em>(3) Essence and Raison d'&#202;tre of Matter</em>

<p>Matter exists only for the spiritual; if the spiritual did not need it, matter would not exist, for its finality is not in itself. But it seems to Origen - though he does not venture to declare so expressly - that created spirits even the most perfect cannot do without an extremely diluted and subtle matter which serves them as a vehicle and means of action (<a href="../fathers/04122.htm"><em>De Principiis</em> II.2.1</a>, <a href="../fathers/04121.htm">I.6.4</a>, etc.). Matter was, therefore, created simultaneously with the spiritual, although the spiritual is <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> prior; and matter will never cease to be because the spiritual, however perfect, will always need it. But matter which is susceptible of indefinite transformations is adapted to the varying condition of the spirits. "When intended for the more imperfect spirits, it becomes solidified, thickens, and forms the bodies of this visible world. If it is serving higher intelligences, it shines with the brightness of the celestial bodies and serves as a garb for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels of God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">children of the Resurrection</a>" (<a href="../fathers/04122.htm"><em>De Principiis</em> II.2.2</a>).

<p><em>(4) Universality of the Redemption and the Final Restoration</em>

<p>Certain Scriptural texts, e.g., <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs25">1 Corinthians 15:25-28</a>, seem to extend to all rational beings the benefit of the Redemption, and Origen allows himself to be led also by the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> principle which he enunciates several times, without ever proving it, that the end is always like the beginning: "We think that the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through the mediation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, will bring all creatures to one and the same end" (<a href="../fathers/04121.htm"><em>De Principiis</em> I.6.1-3</a>). The universal restoration (<em>apokatastasis</em>) follows necessarily from these principles.

<p>On the least reflection, it will be seen that these hypotheses, starting from contrary points of view, are irreconcilable: for the theory of a final restoration is diametrically opposed to the theory of successive indefinite trials. It would be easy to find in the writings of Origen a mass of texts contradicting these principles and destroying the resulting conclusions. He affirms, for instance, that the charity of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> does not fail; in their case "the freedom of the will will be bound so that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> will be impossible" (In Roman., V, 10). So, too, the reprobate will always be fixed in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, less from the inability to free themselves from it, than because they wish to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (<a href="../fathers/04121.htm"><em>De Principiis</em> I.8.4</a>), for malice has become natural to them, it is as a second nature in them (In Joann., xx, 19). Origen grew angry when accused of teaching the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the devil. But the hypotheses which he lays down here and there are none the less worthy of censure. What can be said in his defence, if it be not with St. Athanasius (De decretis Nic., 27), that we must not seek to find his real opinion in the works in which he discusses the arguments for and against <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> as an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> exercise or amusement; or, with <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Ad Pammach. Epist., XLVIII, 12), that it is one thing to dogmatize and another to enunciate hypothetical opinions which will be cleared up by discussion?
<h2 id="section3">Origenist controversies</h2>

<p>The discussions concerning Origen and his teaching are of a very singular and very complex character. They break out unexpectedly, at long intervals, and assume an immense importance quite unforeseen in their <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> beginnings. They are complicated by so many personal disputes and so many questions foreign to the fundamental subject in controversy that a brief and rapid <em>expos&eacute;</em> of the polemics is difficult and well-nigh impossible. Finally they abate so suddenly that one is forced to conclude that the controversy was superficial and that Origen's <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> was not the sole point in dispute.
<h3 id="A">First Origenist Crisis</h3>

<p>It broke out in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">deserts</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, raged in Palestine, and ended at Constantinople with the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> (392-404). During the second half of the fourth century the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Nitria professed an exaggerated enthusiasm for Origen, whilst the neighbouring brethren of Sceta, as a result of an unwarranted reaction and an excessive fear of allegorism, fell into <a href="../cathen/01558c.htm">Anthropomorphism</a>. These <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> discussions gradually invaded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Palestine, which were under the care of <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13393a.htm">Salamis</a>, who, convinced of the dangers of Origenism, had combatted it in his works and was determined to prevent its spread and to extirpate it completely. Having gone to Jerusalem in 394, he preached vehemently against Origen's <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, in presence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city, John, who was deemed an Origenist. John in turn spoke against <a href="../cathen/01558c.htm">Anthropomorphism</a>, directing his discourse so clearly against Epiphanius that no on could be mistaken. Another incident soon helped to embitter the dispute. Epiphanius had raised Paulinian, brother of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in a place subject to the See of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. John complained bitterly of this violation of his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, and the reply of Epiphanius was not of a nature to appease him.

<p>Two new combatants were now ready to enter the lists. From the time when Jerome and Rufinus settled, one at Bethlehem and the other at Mt. Olivet, they had lived in brotherly friendship. Both admired, imitated, and translated Origen, and were on most amicable terms with their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, when in 392 Aterbius, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Sceta, came to Jerusalem and accused them of both of Origenism. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, very sensitive to the question of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, was much hurt by the insinuation of Aterbius and two years later sided with <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, whose reply to John of Jerusalem he translated into Latin. Rufinus learnt, it is not known how, of this translation, which was not intended for the public, and Jerome suspected him of having obtained it by <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraud</a>. A reconciliation was effected sometime later, but it was not lasting. In 397 Rufinus, then at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, had translated Origen's <a href="../fathers/0412.htm">"De principiis"</a> into Latin, and in his preface followed the example of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, whose dithyrambic eulogy addressed to the Alexandrian catechist he remembered. The solitary of Bethlehem, grievously hurt at this action, wrote to his friends to refute the perfidious implication of Rufinus, denounced Origen's <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> to Pope Anastasius, tried to win the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> over to the anti-Origenist cause, and began a discussion with Rufinus, marked with great bitterness on both sides.

<p>Until 400 Theophilus of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> was an acknowledged Origenist. His confident was Isidore, a former <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Nitria, and his friends, "the Tall Brothers", the accredited leaders of the Origenist party. He had supported John of Jerusalem against <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/01558c.htm">Anthropomorphism</a> he denounced to <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">Pope Siricius</a>. Suddenly he changed his views, exactly why was never known. It is said that the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Sceta, displeased with his paschal letter of 399, forcibly invaded his episcopal residence and threatened him with death if he did not chant the palinody. What is certain is that he had quarreled with St. Isidore over money matters and with "the Tall Brothers", who blamed his <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and his worldliness. As Isidore and "the Tall Brothers" had retired to Constantinople, where Chrysostom extended his hospitality to them and interceded for them, without, however, admitting them to communion till the censures pronounced against them had been raised, the irascible <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> determined on this plan: to suppress Origenism everywhere, and under this pretext ruin Chrysostom, whom he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envied</a>. For four years he was mercilessly active: he condemned Origen's books at the <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Council of Alexandria</a> (400), with an armed band he expelled the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from Nitria, he wrote to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and Palestine to win them over to his anti-Origenist crusade, issued paschal letters in 401, 402, and 404 against Origen's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, and sent a missive to Pope Anastasius asking for the condemnation of Origenism. He was successful beyond his hopes; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> accepted his invitation. Those of Palestine, assembled at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, condemned the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> pointed out to them, adding that they were not taught amongst them. Anastasius, while declaring that Origen was entirely unknown to him, condemned the propositions extracted from his books. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> undertook to translate into Latin the various elucubrations of the patriarch, even his virulent diatribe against Chrysostom. <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, preceding Theophilus to Constantinople, treated St. Chrysostom as temerarious, and almost <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, until the day the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> began to dawn on him, and suspecting that he might have been deceived, he suddenly left Constantinople and died at sea before arriving at <a href="../cathen/13393a.htm">Salamis</a>.

<p>It is well known how Theophilus, having been called by the emperor to explain his conduct towards Isidore and "the Tall Brothers", cleverly succeeded by his machinations in changing the r&ocirc;les. Instead of being the accused, he became the accuser, and summoned Chrysostom to appear before the conciliabule of the Oak (ad Quercum), at which Chrysostom was condemned. As soon as the vengeance of Theophilus was satiated nothing more was heard of Origenism. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> began to read Origen, pretending that he could cull the roses from among the thorns. He became reconciled with "the Tall Brothers" without asking them to retract. Hardly had the personal quarrels abated when the spectre of Origenism vanished.
<h3 id="B">Second Origenistic Crisis</h3>

<p>In 514 certain heterodox doctrines of a very singular character had already spread among the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and its environs. Possibly the seeds of the dispute may have been sown by Stephen Bar-Sudaili, a troublesome <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> expelled from <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, who joined to an Origenism of his own brand certain clearly <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> views. Plotting and intriguing continued for about thirty years, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> suspected of Origenism being in turn expelled from their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, then readmitted, only to be driven out anew. Their leaders and protectors were Nonnus, who till his death in 547 kept the party together, Theodore Askidas and Domitian who had won the favour of the emperor and were named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, one to the See of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> in Galatia, the other to that of Caesarea in Cappadocia, though they continued to reside at court (537). In these circumstances a report against Origenism was addressed to Justinian, by whom and on what occasion it is not known, for the two accounts that have come down to us are at variance (Cyrillus of <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Scythopolis</a>, "Vita Sabae"; and Liberatus, "Breviarium", xxiii). At all events, the emperor then wrote his "Liber adversus Origenem", containing in addition to an <em>expos&eacute;</em> of the reasons for condemning it twenty-four censurable texts taken from the <a href="../fathers/0412.htm">"De principiis"</a>, and lastly ten propositions to be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>. Justinian ordered the patriarch <a href="../cathen/10190a.htm">Mennas</a> to call together all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present in Constantinople and make them subscribe to these <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a>. This was the local synod (<em>synodos endemousa</em>) of 543. A copy of the imperial edict had been addressed to the other <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, including <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a>, and all gave their adhesion to it. In the case of Vigilius especially we have the testimony of Liberatus (Breviar., xxiii) and <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> (Institutiones, 1).

<p>It had been expected that Domitian and Theodore Askidas, by their refusal to condemn Origenism, would fall into disfavour at Court; but they signed whatever they were asked to sign and remained more powerful than ever. Askidas even took revenge by persuading the emperor to have <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, who was deemed the sworn enemy of Origen, condemned (Liberatus, "Breviar.", xxiv; Facundas of Hermianus, "Defensio trium capitul.", I, ii; <a href="../cathen/05639b.htm">Evagrius</a>, "Hist.", IV, xxxviii). Justinian's new edict, which is not extant, resulted in the assembling of the fifth <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, Ibas, and Theodoretus were condemned (553).

<p>Were Origen and Origenism <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>? Many learned writers believe so; an equal number deny that they were condemned; most modern authorities are either undecided or reply with reservations. Relying on the most recent studies on the question it may be held that: <OL> <LI>It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the fifth general council was convoked exclusively to deal with the affair of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, and that neither Origen nor Origenism were the cause of it. <LI>It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the council opened on 5 May, 553, in spite of the protestations of <a href="../cathen/15427b.htm">Pope Vigilius</a>, who though at Constantinople refused to attend it, and that in the eight conciliary sessions (from 5 May to 2 June), the Acts of which we possess, only the question of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> is treated. <LI>Finally it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that only the Acts concerning the affair of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> were submitted to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for his approval, which was given on 8 December, 553, and 23 February, 554. <LI>It is a fact that Popes Vigilius, <a href="../cathen/11602a.htm">Pelagius I</a> (556-61), <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pelagius II</a> (579-90), <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> (590-604), in treating of the fifth council deal only with the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>, make no mention of Origenism, and speak as if they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of its condemnation. <LI>It must be admitted that before the opening of the council, which had been delayed by the resistance of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> already assembled at Constantinople had to consider, by order of the emperor, a form of Origenism that had practically nothing in common with Origen, but which was held, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, by one of the Origenist parties in Palestine. The arguments in corroboration of this hypothesis may be found in Dickamp (op. cit., 66-141). <LI>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> certainly subscribed to the fifteen <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a> proposed by the emperor (ibid., 90-96); and admitted Origenist, Theodore of <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Scythopolis</a>, was forced to retract (ibid., 125-129); but there is no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who was at that time protesting against the convocation of the council, was asked. <LI>It is easy to understand how this extra-conciliary sentence was mistaken at a later period for a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the actual <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">ecumenical council</a>. </OL>
