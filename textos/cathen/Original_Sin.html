<h2 id="i">Meaning</h2>

<p>Original sin may be taken to mean: (1) the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> committed; (2) a consequence of this first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the hereditary stain with which we are born on account of our origin or descent from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>.

<p>From the earliest times the latter sense of the word was more common, as may be seen by St. Augustine's statement: "the deliberate <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first man</a> is the cause of original sin" (De nupt. et concup., II, xxvi, 43). It is the hereditary stain that is dealt with here. As to the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> we have not to examine the circumstances in which it was committed nor make the <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> of the <a href="../bible/gen003.htm">third chapter of Genesis</a>.

<h2 id="ii">Principal adversaries</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodorus of Mopsuestia</a> opened this controversy by denying that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was the origin of death. (See the "Excerpta Theodori", by <a href="../cathen/09672b.htm">Marius Mercator</a>; cf. Smith, "A Dictionary of Christian Biography", IV, 942.) Celestius, a friend of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>, was the first in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a> to hold these propositions, borrowed from <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodorus</a>: "Adam was to die in every hypothesis, whether he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> or did not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. His <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> injured himself only and not the <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">human race</a>" (<a href="../cathen/09672b.htm">Mercator</a>, "Liber Subnotationem", preface). This, the first position held by the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, was also the first point condemned at Carthage (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchiridion", no 101-old no. 65). Against this fundamental <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> cited especially <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs12">Romans 5:12</a>, where <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> is shown as transmitting death with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.

<p>After some <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> admitted the transmission of death &#151; this being more easily understood as we see that <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> transmit to their children <a href="../cathen/07254a.htm">hereditary</a> diseases &#151; but they still <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> attacked the transmission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (St. Augustine, "Contra duas epist. Pelag.", IV, iv, 6). And when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> speaks of the transmission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> they understood by this the transmission of death. This was their second position, condemned by the <a href="../cathen/11266b.htm">Council of Orange</a> [Denz., n. 175 (145)], and again later on with the first by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> [Sess. V, can. ii; Denz., n. 789 (671)]. To take the word <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to mean death was an evident falsification of the text, so the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> soon abandoned the interpretation and admitted that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in us. They did not, however, understand by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the hereditary stain contracted at our birth, but the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that adults commit in imitation of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. This was their third position, to which is opposed the <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">definition</a> of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is transmitted to all by generation (<em>propagatione</em>), not by imitation [Denz., n. 790 (672)]. Moreover, in the following canon are cited the words of the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a>, in which there is question of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> contracted by generation and effaced by generation [Denz., n. 102 (66)].

<p>The leaders of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> admitted the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of original sin, but at present there are many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> imbued with <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinian</a> doctrines whose theory is a revival of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>.

<h2 id="iii">Original sin in Scripture</h2>

<p>The classical text is <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs12">Romans 5:12</a> sqq. In the preceding part the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">apostle</a> treats of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and to put in evidence the fact of His being the one Saviour, he contrasts with this <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Divine Head</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">human head</a> who <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> its ruin. The question of original sin, therefore, comes in only incidentally. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> supposes the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that the faithful have of it from his oral instructions, and he speaks of it to make them understand the work of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a>. This explains the brevity of the development and the obscurity of some verses.

<p>We shall now show what, in the text, is opposed to the three <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> positions:

<p>(1) The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> has injured the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> at least in the sense that it has introduced death &#151; "Wherefore as by one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into this world and by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> death; and so death passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>". Here there is question of physical death. First, the literal meaning of the word ought to be presumed unless there be some reason to the contrary. Second, there is an allusion in this verse to a passage in the <a href="../cathen/15666a.htm">Book of Wisdom</a> in which, as may be seen from the context, there is question of physical death. <a href="../bible/wis002.htm#vrs24">Wisdom 2:24</a>: "But by the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> death came into the world". Cf. <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#vrs17">Genesis 2:17</a>; <a href="../bible/gen003.htm#vrs3">3:3, 19</a>; and another parallel passage in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> himself, <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs21">1 Corinthians 15:21</a>: "For by a man came death and by a man the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>". Here there can be question only of physical death, since it is opposed to <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">corporal resurrection</a>, which is the subject of the <a href="../bible/1co015.htm">whole chapter</a>.

<p>(2) <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> by his fault transmitted to us not only death but also <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, "for as by the disobedience of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> many [i.e., all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>] were made <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinners</a>" (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs19">Romans 5:19</a>). How then could the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, and at a later period <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a>, say that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> speaks only of the transmission of physical death? If according to them we must read <em>death</em> where the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> wrote <em><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em>, we should also read that the disobedience of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> has made us <em>mortal</em> where the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> writes that it has made us <em>sinners</em>. But the word <em>sinner</em> has never meant <em>mortal</em>, nor has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> ever meant <em>death</em>. Also in <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs12">verse 12</a>, which corresponds to <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs19">verse 19</a>, we see that by one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> two things have been brought on all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death, the one being the consequence of the other and therefore not identical with it.

<p>(3) Since <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> transmits death to his children by way of generation when he begets them mortal, it is by generation also that he transmits to them <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> presents these two effects as produced at the same <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> and by the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>. The explanation of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> differs from that of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. According to them the child who receives mortality at his birth receives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> only at a later period when he knows the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first man</a> and is inclined to imitate it. The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> as regards mortality would, therefore, be completely different from his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> as regards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Moreover, this supposed influence of the bad example of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> is almost chimerical; even the faithful when they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on account of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> bad example, <em>a fortiori</em> <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidels</a> who are completely <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the history of the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first man</a>. And yet all men are, by the influence of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinners</a> and condemned (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs18">Romans 5:18, 19</a>). The influence of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> cannot, therefore, be the influence of his bad example which we imitate (Augustine, "Contra julian.", VI, xxiv, 75).



<p>On this account, several recent <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> have thus modified the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> explanation: "Even without being aware of it all men imitate <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> inasmuch as they merit death as the punishment of their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> just as <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> merited it as the punishment for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>." This is going farther and farther from the text of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> would be no more than the term of a comparison, he would no longer have any influence or <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a> as regards original sin or death. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> did not affirm that all men, in imitation of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, are mortal on account of their actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; since children who die before coming to the use of reason have never committed such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but he expressly affirms the contrary in the fourteenth verse: "But death reigned", not only over those who imitated <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, but "even over them also who have not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> after the similitude of the transgression of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>." <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, therefore, is the sole cause of death for the entire <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">human race</a>. Moreover, we can discern no natural connexion between any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death. In order that a determined <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entail death there is need of a <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">positive law</a>, but before the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law of Moses</a> there was no <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">positive law</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> appointing death as a punishment except the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> given to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#vrs17">Genesis 2:17</a>). It is, therefore, his disobedience only that could have merited and brought it into the world (<a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs13">Romans 5:13, 14</a>).

<p>These <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> writers lay much stress on the last words of the <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs12">twelfth verse</a>. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that several of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> understood the words "in whom all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>", to mean, all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. This interpretation would be an extra <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the thesis of original sin, but it is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Modern <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>, as well as the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, prefer to translate "and so death passed upon all men <em>because</em> all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>". We accept this second translation which shows us death as an effect of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But of what <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? "The personal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of each one", answer our adversaries, "this is the natural sense of the words 'all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.'" It would be the natural sense if the context was not absolutely opposed to it. The words "all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>" of the <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs12">twelfth verse</a>, which are obscure on account of their brevity, are thus developed in the <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs19">nineteenth verse</a>: "for as by the disobedience of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> many were made <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinners</a>." There is no question here of personal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, differing in <a href="../cathen/14210a.htm">species</a> and number, committed by each one during his life, but of one first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which was enough to transmit equally to all men a state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the title of sinners. Similarly in the twelfth verse the words "all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>" must mean, "all have participated in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>", "all have contracted its stain". This interpretation too removes the seeming contradiction between the <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs12">twelfth verse</a>, "all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>", and the fourteenth, "who have not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>", for in the former there is question of original sin, in the latter of personal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Those who say that in both cases there is question of personal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are unable to reconcile these two verses.

<h2 id="iv">Original sin in tradition</h2>

<p>On account of a superficial resemblance between the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of original sin and the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaean</a> theory of our <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> accused the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and St. Augustine of <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaeism</a>. For the accusation and its answer see "Contra duas epist. Pelag.", I, II, 4; V, 10; III, IX, 25; IV, III. In our own times this charge has been reiterated by several critics and historians of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> who have been influenced by the fact that before his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> St. Augustine was a <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaean</a>. They do not identify <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaeism</a> with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of original sin, but they say that St. Augustine, with the remains of his former <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manichaean</a> prejudices, created the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of original sin unknown before his time.

<p>It is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of original sin does not appear in the works of the pre-Augustinian Fathers. On the contrary, their testimony is found in special works on the subject. Nor can it be said, as Harnack maintains, that St. Augustine himself acknowledges the absence of this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in the writings of the Fathers. St. Augustine invokes the testimony of eleven Fathers, Greek as well as <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> (Contra Jul., II, x, 33). Baseless also is the assertion that before St. Augustine this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was unknown to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; as we have already shown, it was taught by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. It is found in the fourth Book of <a href="../cathen/05535a.htm">Esdras</a>, a work written by a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> in the first century after <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and widely read by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. This book represents <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> as the author of the fall of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> (vii, 48), as having transmitted to all his posterity the permanent infirmity, the malignity, the bad seed of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (iii, 21, 22; iv, 30). <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> themselves admit the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of original sin in this book and others of the same period (see Sanday, "The International Critical Commentary: Romans", 134, 137; Hastings, "A Dictionary of the Bible", I, 841). It is therefore impossible to make St. Augustine, who is of a much later <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, the inventor of original sin.

<p>That this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> existed in <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Christian tradition</a> before St. Augustine's <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> is shown by the practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of children. The <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> held that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was given to children, not to remit their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but to make them better, to give them <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, to make them <a href="../cathen/01148a.htm">adoptive sons of God</a>, and heirs to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of Heaven</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, <a href="../fathers/15011.htm"><em>Of Sin and Merit</em> I.18</a>). The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> answered by citing the <a href="../cathen/11049a.htm">Nicene Creed</a>, "Confiteor unum baptisma in remissionem peccatorum". They reproached the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> with introducing two <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, one for adults to remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the other for children with no such purpose. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> argued, too, from the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which suppose the child to be under the power of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, i.e., <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcisms</a>, <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a> of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> made by the sponsor in the name of the child [Augustine, loc. cit., xxxiv, 63; Denz., n. 140 (96)].

<h2 id="v">Original sin in face of the objections from reason</h2>

<p>We do not pretend to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of original sin by arguments from <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> only. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> makes use of a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> which <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> rather of some kind of decadence than of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and he considers his <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> as probable only, <em>satis probabiliter probari potest</em> (Contra Gent., IV, lii). Many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> and some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> hold the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of original sin to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and the only means of solving the problem of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. This is exaggerated and impossible to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a>. It suffices to show that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> has no serious objection against this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which is founded on Revelation. The objections of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalists</a> usually spring from a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> concept of our <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. They attack either the transmission of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of an injury inflicted on his race by the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first man</a>, of a decadence of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Here we shall answer only the second category of objections, the others will be considered under a later head (VII).

<p>(1) The law of progress is opposed to the hypothesis of a decadence. Yes, if the progress was necessarily continuous, but history <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a> the contrary. The line representing progress has its ups and downs, there are periods of decadence and of retrogression, and such was the period, Revelation tells us, that followed the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">human race</a>, however, began to rise again little by little, for neither intelligence nor <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> had been destroyed by original sin and, consequently, there still remained the possibility of material progress, whilst in the spiritual order <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did not abandon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to whom He had promised <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>. This theory of decadence has no connexion with our Revelation. The <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, on the contrary, shows us even spiritual progress in the people it treats of: the vocation of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, the mission of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a>, the coming of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a> which becomes clearer and clearer, ending in the Gospel, its diffusion amongst all nations, its fruits of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and the progress of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>(2) It is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, says another objection, that from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> should result the decadence of the whole <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">human race</a>. This would have weight if we took this decadence in the same sense that <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> took it, i.e. <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> incapable of understanding even <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> destroyed, the very <a href="../cathen/14322c.htm">substance</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> changed into <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.

<p>But according to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has not lost his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natural</a> <a href="../cathen/05749a.htm">faculties</a>: by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> he has been deprived only of the Divine gifts to which his <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> had no strict <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a>, the complete mastery of his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, exemption from death, <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a> in the next life. The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Creator</a>, whose gifts were not due to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to bestow them on such <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> as He wished and to make their conservation depend on the fidelity of the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">head of the family</a>. A prince can confer a hereditary dignity on condition that the recipient remains loyal, and that, in case of his rebelling, this dignity shall be taken from him and, in consequence, from his descendants. It is not, however, intelligible that the prince, on account of a fault committed by a father, should order the hands and feet of all the descendants of the guilty man to be cut off immediately after their birth. This comparison represents the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> which we in no way defend. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> supposes no sensible or afflictive punishment in the next world for children who die with nothing but original sin on their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, but only the privation of the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">sight of God</a> [Denz., n. 1526 (1389)].

<h2 id="vi">Nature of original sin</h2>

<p>This is a difficult point and many systems have been invented to explain it: it will suffice to give the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> explanation now commonly received. Original sin is the privation of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. This solution, which is that of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, goes back to <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a> and even to the traditions of the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as we see by the declaration of the <a href="../cathen/11266b.htm">Second Council of Orange</a> (A.D. 529): <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">one man</a> has transmitted to the whole <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">human race</a> not only the death of the body, which is the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but even <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself, <em>which is the death of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></em> [Denz., n. 175 (145)]. As death is the privation of the principle of <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>, the death of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the privation of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> which according to all <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> is the principle of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. Therefore, if original sin is "the death of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>", it is the privation of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, although it did not make this solution <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> by a <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">definition</a>, regarded it with favour and authorized its use (cf. Pallavicini, "Istoria del Concilio di Trento", vii-ix). Original sin is described not only as the death of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (Sess. V, can. ii), but as a "privation of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that each child contracts at its conception" (Sess. VI, cap. iii). But the Council calls "justice" what we call <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> (Sess. VI), and as each child should have had personally his own <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> so now after the fall he suffers his own privation of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.

<p>We may add an argument based on the principle of St. Augustine already cited, "the deliberate <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first man</a> is the cause of original sin". This principle is developed by <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm</a>: "the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was one thing but the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of children at their birth is quite another, the former was the cause, the latter is the effect" (De conceptu virginali, xxvi). In a child original sin is distinct from the fault of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, it is one of its effects. But which of these effects is it? We shall examine the several effects of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam's</a> fault and reject those which cannot be original sin:

<p>(1) Death and Suffering.- These are purely physical <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> and cannot be called <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Moreover <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, and after him the councils, regarded death and original sin as two distinct things transmitted by <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>.

<p>(2) Concupiscence.- This rebellion of the lower <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetite</a> transmitted to us by <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> is an <a href="../cathen/11196a.htm">occasion of sin</a> and in that sense comes nearer to <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. However, the occasion of a fault is not necessarily a fault, and whilst original sin is effaced by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> still remains in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; therefore original sin and <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> cannot be one and the same thing, as was held by the early <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> (see Council of Trent, Sess. V, can. v).

<p>(3) The absence of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> in the new-born child is also an effect of the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, having received <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">justice</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lost it not only for himself but also for us (loc. cit., can. ii). If he has lost it for us we were to have received it from him at our birth with the other prerogatives of our race. Therefore the absence of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> in a child is a real privation, it is the want of something that should have been in him according to the Divine plan. If this favour is not merely something physical but is something in the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> order, if it is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, its privation may be called a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and is so called by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, because <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> consists in union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and grace unites us intimately with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">Moral</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> consists in this, that our action is according to the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, but grace is a deification, as the Fathers say, a perfect conformity with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who is the first rule of all morality. (See <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">GRACE</a>.) <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">Sanctifying grace</a> therefore enters into the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> order, not as an act that passes but as a permanent tendency which exists even when the subject who possesses it does not act; it is a turning towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>conversio ad Deum</em>. Consequently the privation of this grace, even without any other act, would be a stain, a <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> deformity, a turning away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em>aversio a Deo</em>, and this <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> is not found in any other effect of the fault of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>. This privation, therefore, is the hereditary stain.

<h2 id="vii">How voluntary</h2>

<p>"There can be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is not <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, the learned and the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> admit this evident <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>", writes St. Augustine (De vera relig., xiv, 27). The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has condemned the opposite solution given by <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a> [prop. xlvi, xlvii, in Denz., n. 1046 (926)]. Original sin is not an act but, as already explained, a state, a permanent privation, and this can be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> indirectly &#151; just as a <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunken</a> man is deprived of his <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and incapable of using his liberty, yet it is by his free fault that he is in this state and hence his <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, his privation of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> and can be imputed to him.

<p>But how can original sin be even indirectly <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> for a child that has never used its personal <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>? Certain <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> hold that a child on coming to the use of reason will <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> to its original sin; but in reality no one ever thought of giving this <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a>. Besides, even before the use of reason, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is already in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, according to the data of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of children and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> contracted by generation. Some <a href="../cathen/14626a.htm">theosophists</a> and <a href="../cathen/14221a.htm">spiritists</a> admit the pre-existence of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in a former <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> which they now forget; but apart from the absurdity of this <a href="../cathen/10234d.htm">metempsychosis</a>, it contradicts the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of original sin, it substitutes a number of particular <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> for the one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of a <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">common father</a> transmitting <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death to all (cf. <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs12">Romans 5:12 sqq.</a>). The whole <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, says <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, may be summed up in the intervention of two men, the one to ruin us, the other to save us (<a href="../fathers/15011.htm"><em>Of Sin and Merit</em> I.24</a>). The right solution is to be sought in the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and this <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> was ours: "we were all in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>", says <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, cited by St. Augustine (Opus imperf., IV, civ). <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> attributes to us the act of the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first man</a>: "Because <em>we</em> did not fast (when <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> ate the forbidden fruit) we have been turned out of the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">garden of Paradise</a>" (Hom. i de jejun., iv). Earlier still is the testimony of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a>; "In the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first Adam</a> we offend <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, disobeying His precept" (Haeres., V, xvi, 3).

<p><a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> thus explains this moral unity of our will with the will of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>.

<blockquote><p>"An <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> can be considered either as an <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> or as part of a whole, a member of a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> . . . . Considered in the second way an act can be his although he has not done it himself, nor has it been done by his <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> but by the rest of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> or by its head, the nation being considered as doing what the prince does. For a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is considered as a single man of whom the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> are the different members (St. Paul, <a href="../bible/1co012.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>). Thus the multitude of men who receive their <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> is to be considered as a single community or rather as a single body . . . . If the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whose privation of original <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is due to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, is considered as a private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, this privation is not his 'fault', for a fault is essentially <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>. If, however, we consider him as a member of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, as if all men were only one man, then his privation partakes of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on account of its <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> origin, which is the actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>" (De Malo, iv, 1).</p></blockquote>

<p>It is this law of solidarity, admitted by common sentiment, which attributes to children a part of the shame resulting from the father's crime. It is not a personal crime, objected the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>. "No", answered St. Augustine, " but it is paternal crime" (Op. imperf., I, cxlviii). Being a distinct <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> I am not strictly responsible for the crime of another; the act is not mine. Yet, as a member of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, I am supposed to have acted with its <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">head</a> who represented it with regard to the conservation or the loss of grace. I am, therefore, responsible for my privation of grace, taking responsibility in the largest sense of the word. This, however, is enough to make the state of privation of grace in a certain degree <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, and, therefore, "without absurdity it may be said to be <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>" (St. Augustine, "Retract.", I, xiii).

<p>Thus the principal difficulties of non-believers against the transmission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are answered.

<p>"Free will is essentially incommunicable." Physically, yes; morally, no; the will of the father being considered as that of his children.

<p>"It is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> to make us responsible for an act committed before our birth." Strictly responsible, yes; responsible in a wide sense of the word, no; the crime of a father brands his yet unborn children with shame, and entails upon them a share of his own responsibility.

<p>"Your <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> makes us strictly responsible for the fault of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>." That is a misconception of our <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Our <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> does not attribute to the children of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> any properly so-called responsibility for the act of their father, nor do we say that original sin is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in the strict sense of the word. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that, considered as "a <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> deformity", "a separation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>", as "the death of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>", original sin is a real <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which deprives the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>. It has the same claim to be a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as has habitual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which is the state in which an adult is placed by a grave and personal fault, the "stain" which <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> defines as "the privation of grace" (<a href="../summa/2109.htm#article7">I-II:109:7</a>; <a href="../summa/4087.htm#article2">III:87:2, ad 3</a>), and it is from this point of view that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, putting an end to the privation of grace, "takes away all that is really and properly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>", for <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> which remains "is not really and properly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>", although its transmission was equally <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> (Council of Trent, Sess. V, can. v.). Considered precisely as <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, original sin is only the shadow of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> properly so-called. According to <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (In II Sent., dist. xxv, Q. i, a. 2, ad 2um), it is not called <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the same sense, but only in an analogous sense.

<p>Several <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, neglecting the importance of the privation of grace in the explanation of original sin, and explaining it only by the participation we are supposed to have in the act of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a>, exaggerate this participation. They exaggerate the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> in original sin, thinking that it is the only way to explain how it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> properly so-called. Their opinion, differing from that of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, gave rise to uncalled-for and insoluble difficulties. At present it is altogether abandoned.
