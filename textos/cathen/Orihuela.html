<h1>Orihuela</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF ORIHUELA (ORIOLENSIS, ORIOLANA).

<p>The Diocese of Orihuela comprises all the civil Province of Alicante except the two townships (pueblos) of Caudete (Albacete) and Ayora (Valencia). The city of Orihuela, with its suburbs, has a population of 24,364. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> was in ancient times at Bigastro or the place known as Ceheg&iacute;n. Jaime the Conqueror recovered Orihuela from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> in 1265, giving it to his son-in-law Alfonso X, the Wise, of Castile, and restoring the church, which came under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03384b.htm">See of Cartagena</a>. When Orihuela was lost to the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> crown, in 1304, Martin of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> petitioned the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to give it a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of its own. The first concession was made, by the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII (Luna)</a>, who made the church of Salvador a collegiate church. On the petition of Alfonso V, <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> instituted a vicariate-general, independent of Murcia and Cartagena, for the portion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> lying within the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Kingdom of Aragon</a>. No <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was appointed until 1437, when it was given as its first, a scion of the House of Corella, who never took possession. <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a> suppressed the new diocese; <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> accorded to the church of Orihuela the rank of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (1510), but subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03384b.htm">Cartagena</a>. Peace was secured only when Philip II, in the Cortes of Monz&oacute;n (1563), decided to separate the church of Orihuela from <a href="../cathen/03384b.htm">Cartagena</a>, and obtained from <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a>, in 1564, the creation of a new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was a native of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, Gregorio Gallo y Andrada, confessor to Queen Isabel of Valois. Among his successors, Jos&eacute; Esteban added to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> the chapter of St. Stephen, where he is buried. Juan Elias G&oacute;mez de Ter&aacute;n built at his own expense (1743) the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of La Pur&iacute;sima Concepci&oacute;n, the Seminary of St. Miguel, and the House of Mercy. He also caused to be erected the Chapel of the <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter house</a>, and the <em>archivium</em>. This <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> lies buried in the church of La Misericordia at Alicante. Jos&eacute; de Rada y Aguirre was confessor to Ferdinand VI. Jos&eacute; Tormo enlarged the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, rebuilt much of the episcopal palace, erected episcopal residences at Cox and Elche, and the Chapel of the <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> in the great church of the latter city. Several works of public utility are due to him, such as the aqueduct of Elche, the ridge of Rojales, and a wall protecting the cultivated lands of Orihuela against inundation. Another occupant of this see was Cardinal Despuig (1791). Francisco Antonio Cebri&aacute;n y Valda (1797) ruled the diocese eighteen years, afterwards becoming <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the Indies. The episcopate of Felix Herrero Valverde was long and fruitful; he improved the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and other churches, laboured to repair the damage done by the earthquake of 1829, and suffered a long exile in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> after the death of Ferdinand VII.

<p>Conspicuous among the buildings of Orihuela is the Seminary of St. Miguel, situated upon a rocky eminence. Founded in 1743, it possesses a good <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, a hall of exercises (<em>sal&oacute;n de actos</em>) built by Bishop Pedro Mar&iacute;a Cubero (1859), and the general <em>archivium</em> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. It is divided into two colleges: that of the Apostolic Missionaries, founded by Bishop Ter&aacute;n, and the episcopal college. The most notable of the churches is the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of the Transfiguration (El Salvador): its style is a simple ogival of the fourteenth century. The principal door &#151; the "Door of the Chains" &#151; is Gothic; that of the Annunciation is Plateresque. The great <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, of beautiful ogival work, was demolished in 1827 to enlarge the enclosure. The grille of the choir and the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> have been considered the finest in the kingdom (Viciana): they are <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> of the sixteenth century. The vast episcopal palace, separated from the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> by a street, was built in 1733 by Bishop Jos&eacute; Flores Osirio, on the left bank of the River Segura. It contains a magnificent staircase. The principal churches are Sta Justa y Rufina and the Apost&oacute;l Santiago (St. James the Apostle), both restored Gothic. The former is said to have been a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church in the time of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, but it was reconstructed between 1319 and 1348. That of Santiago is a fine Gothic structure, and bears the device of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Sovereigns: TANTO MONTA; and the arms of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>. The great <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was built between 1554 and 1609, and the tabernacle, of rare marbles, is eighteenth-century work.

<p>Orihuela had many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> &#151; Augustinian, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Mercedarian</a>, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Trinitarian, Alcantarine, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/02802b.htm">Hospitallers of St. John of God</a>. Those of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> are still extant, as also of the Salesian and Augustinian Sisters and the Clarissas. But the principal edifice of Orihuela is that of its <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>; otherwise called the Patriarchal College of Preachers, founded by the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> Fernando de Loaces, a native of Orihuela, who spent 80,000 ducats ($800,000) on it and gave it to the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. At first this institution was occupied only with <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies, for members of the order, but it afterwards obtained faculties for the conferring of scientific degrees, with privileges equal to those of the most celebrated <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, and the titles of Illustrious, Royal, and Pontifical (1640). It was suppressed in 1824. The building, having been declared an historical monument, was given to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who now carry on in it a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> and boarding-school. In the same building the public archives and <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> are housed, the latter consisting largely of books taken from the suppressed <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. The sarcophagus of the founder is in the <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a> of the magnificent church. A <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> stands above the principal door, and above it a colossal Minerva.

<p>By the Concordat of 1851, the See of Orihuela is to be transferred to Alicante, a city with two excellent churches: that of S. Nicol&aacute;s and the older church of Sta. Mar&iacute;a, formerly a mosque. It was destroyed by fire and entirely rebuilt in the ogival style. The collegiate church founded by Alfonso X, the Wise, was made a collegiate church by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> (1600), and, by the terms of the Concordat, is destined to be the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Alicante. Also celebrated is the sanctuary of the Holy Face at Alicante, originally occupied by <a href="../cathen/07345a.htm">Hieronymites</a>, but now by the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>. The linen cloth bearing the imprint of the Holy Face was brought from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Moss&eacute;n Mena of Alicante and is an object of great veneration in that part of the country. Elcha, famous for its palm-trees, has a noteworthy church dedicated to the Assumption, on which feast it still holds a dramatic representation of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> character. Orihuela has a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, a Casa de Misericordia for the poor and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> (1734), and a <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">foundling asylum</a> founded by Charles III in 1764.
