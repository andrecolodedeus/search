<h1>Orvieto</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF ORVIETO (URBEVETANA)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The city stands on a rugged mass of tufa, near the rivers Paglia and Chiana, the swamps of which were drained by <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>. Some believe this town to be the ancient Hebanum or Oropitum; others, e.g., M&uuml;ller and Gamurrini, hold that it was the primitive port (therefore <em>Urbs vetus</em>, or old city) of the Etruscan city of Volsinii, destroyed by the Romans at an uncertain date, and rebuilt on the site of the present Bolsena which gives its name to the largest lake of the Italian peninsula. In the country around Orvieto there are many Etruscan <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a>. The name of Urbs Vetus appears for the first time in Procopius, corrupted into Urbebentum; it is also found in the writings of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>.

<p>During the Gothic War, Orvieto was defended by the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> for a long time. Later, it fell into the hands of the Lombards (606). From the latter end of the tenth century the city was governed by consuls, who, however, took the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of fealty to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; but from 1201 it governed itself through a <em>podest&agrave;</em> (in that year, the Bishop Richard) and a captain of the people. On account of its position, Orvieto was often chosen by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> as a place of refuge and <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a> fortified it. A "Studium Generale" was granted to the city by <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> in 1337. In the middle of the thirteenth century, bitter feuds arose between the Filipeschi and the Monaldeschi <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, and were not quelled until the city came under the rule of Ermanno Monaldeschi, whom Cardinal Albornoz reduced to obedience to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. One of the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> was built at Orvieto (1220); and in 1288 there was founded in the town a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. In 1199 the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Pietro Parenzo took place at Orvieto; he was a Roman whom <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> had sent to govern that city with a view to suppressing the Patarian movement that Ermanno of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> and Gottardo of <a href="../cathen/09718c.htm">Marsi</a> had roused in the town.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Orvieto is one of the most beautiful churches in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; it was begun in 1285, and is of the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> style, with three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>; its tripartite <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> was a conception of Lorenzo Maitani, and is embellished in its lower portion with scenes from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a> and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testaments</a>, and in its upper part with <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, the Prophets, and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. The walls in the interior of the edifice are built of layers of Travertine marble and of basalt; the choir is adorned with frescoes, illustrating the life of the Blessed Virgin; they are by Ugolino di Prete Ilario, Peter di Puccio, and Anthony of <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>; the stalls of the choir are of inlaid work. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> on the right, called Our Lady of San Brizio, was <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01483b.htm">Blessed Angelico of Fiesole</a> ("Christ Glorified", "Last Judgment", and "The Prophets", done in 1447) and by <a href="../cathen/13787a.htm">Luca Signorelli</a> ("Fall of Antichrist", "Resurrection of the Dead", "Damned and Blessed", etc.); <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a> took inspiration from these <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> for his "Last Judgment" of the Sistine Chapel; there is, also by <a href="../cathen/13787a.htm">Signorelli</a>, the "Burial of Jesus", and there are several <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> by Scalza (1572), among them the group of the Piet&agrave;, chiselled from a single block of marble. The <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> on the opposite side, called "of the Corporal", contains the large <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> in which is preserved the corporal of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of Bolsena (see below). This receptacle was made by order of Bishop Bertrand dei Monaldeschi, by the <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienese</a> Ugolino di M&aelig;stro Vieri (1337); it is of silver, adorned with enamellings that represent the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Jesus</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>; the frescoes of the walls, by Ugolino (1357-64), also represent the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. In the palace of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, built by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, is the civic museum, which contains Etruscan antiquities and works of art that are, for the greater part, from the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Among the other notable churches of Orvieto are San Giovenale, which contains remnants of ancient frescoes, and San Andrea, which has a dodecagon tower; in 1220 Pierre d'Artois was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> King of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> by <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> in this church.

<p>The first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Orvieto was John (about 590), and in 591 appears a Bishop Candidus; among its other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> were Constantino Medici, O.P., sent by <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> in 1255 to <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, where he died; Francesco Monaldeschi (1280), who did much for the construction of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In 1528 <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> sought refuge at Orvieto, and while there ordered the construction of the "Pozzo di San Patrizio" (the well of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>), by <a href="../cathen/13443a.htm">Sangallo</a>. Bishop Sebastiano Vanzi (1562) distinguished himself at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> and built the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which was enlarged afterwards by Cardinal Fausto Polo (1645) and by Giacomo Silvestri, the latter of whom gave to it the college and other <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> (1773); Cardinal Paolo Antamori (1780) caused the history of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Orvieto to be written by Guglielmo della Valle; and lastly G.B. Lambruschini (1807).

<p>With the See of Orvieto has been united from time immemorial that of Bolsena (the ancient Volsinii), of the ruins of which there are still the remnants of the temple of Nortia, of the "Therm&aelig;", or hot baths, of Sejanus, of the mausoleum of L. Canuelius, etc. According to Pliny, 2000 <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> were taken to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> from Volsinii, when the latter was destroyed in 254 B.C. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, Bolsena had much to suffer from the neighbouring lords (Vico, Bisenzo, Cerbara, etc.), and from the Orvietans, who claimed dominion over it; while, in 1377, the town was sacked by the adventurer Hawkwood (Acuto). On the Island of Martana, in the lake near by, Amalasunta, daughter of Theodoricus and wife of Theodatus, was strangled. To this island, in the sixth century, was transferred the body of St. Christina, a virgin and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of Bolsena (297?), but it was later returned to the city; the church of this saint contains a reclining <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of her by <a href="../cathen/13095b.htm">Luca della Robbia</a>; annexed to the church is an <a href="../cathen/03510a.htm">ancient Christian cemetery</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">ancient Christian inscriptions</a> are numerous at Bolsena. Three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Volsinii are known: Gaudentius (499), Candidus (601), who, it appears, is not the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Orvieto of that name, and Agnellus (680).
<h2>The miracle of Bolsena</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">Miracle</a> of Bolsena is not supported by strong historical evidence, and its tradition is not altogether consistent; for in the first place <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> makes no mention of it in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> by which he established the feast of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>, although the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> is said to have taken place in his day and to have determined him in his purpose of establishing the feast; likewise, the two biographers of <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Pope Urban</a> impugn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this tradition by their silence, i.e., Muratori, "Rerum Italicarum scriptores", III, pt. l, 400 sq.; and especially Thierricus Vallicoloris, who, in his life of the <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">pope</a> in Latin verse, describes in detail all the acts of the <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">pontiff</a> during the latter's stay at Orvieto, referring elsewhere also to the devotion of <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban</a> in celebrating the Mass, and to the institution of the Feast of Corpus Christi, without at any time making allusion to the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> at Bolsena. The latter is related in the inscription on a slab of red marble in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Christina, and is of later date than the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> (1328). The oldest historical record of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> is contained in the enamel "histories" that adorn the front of the <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> (1337-39). It is to be noted that in the narratives of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> cited by Fumi (Il Santuario, 73) the <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> only is called "tabernaculum D.N.J.C.", or "tab . . . pro D.N.J.C." or, again, "tabernacolo del Corpo di Xpo."

<p>In 1344 <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>, referring to this matter in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, uses only the words "propter miraculum aliquod" (Pennazzi, 367); <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a>, in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 25 June, 1337, gives a short account of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>; and abundant reference to it is found later on (1435), in the sermons of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> preacher Leonardo Mattei of <a href="../cathen/15118a.htm">Udine</a> ("In festo Corp. Christi", xiv, ed. <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1652, 59) and by <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a> of Florence ("Chronica", III, 19, xiii, 1), the latter, however, does not say (as the local legend recites) that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence of Christ in the Holy Eucharist</a>, but, merely that a few drops from the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> fell upon the corporal. For the rest, a similar legend of the "blood-stained corporal" is quite frequent in the legendaries of even earlier date than the fourteenth century, and coincides with the great Eucharistic polemics of the ninth to the twelfth centuries. The reddish spots on the corporal of Bolsena, upon close observation, show the profile of a face of the type by which the Saviour is traditionally represented.
