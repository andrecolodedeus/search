<h1>Osaka</h1>  

<p>(Osachensis).

<p>Osaka (<em>Oye</em>, great river; <em>saka</em>, cliff), one of the three municipal prefectures (<em>ken</em>) of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, is situated on both banks of the Yodo River and along the eastern shore of Osaka Bay. The second city in <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> in population, it far outstrips all other cities of the empire in wealth, commerce, and industries. The name Osaka apparently dates only from about 1492; previously the town was called <em>Naniwa</em> ("dashing waves", still used in poetry). According to our earliest information concerning the town, not undoubtedly genuine, it received its original name from Jinmu, first Emperor of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, who landed there about 660 B.C. In A.D. 313 Emperor Nintoku made it his capital. Various subsequent emperors (e.g. Kotoku in 645 and Shomu in 724) also resided there, but it was only after it had become in the sixteenth century a great <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> religious centre that the wealth and importance of the city began rapidly to increase. Fortified in 1534, it was the chief stronghold of the <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhists</a> during the bloody <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> to which they were subjected under Nobunaga. All efforts to dislodge them failed until, in obedience to the order of the emperor, they yielded up possession of the town in 1580. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> founder of the modern prosperity and importance of Osaka was undoubtedly Hideyoshi (see <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>). Recognizing that the strategic position of the town would enable him to dominate the <em>daimyos</em> of the south and west, he determined to make Osaka his capital, and built on the site of the great <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> the Castle of Osaka &mdash; an admirable example of old <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> architecture. The palace which he built within this castle has been placed by some authorities among the most glorious the world has ever seen; it was deliberately burned by the Tokugawa party in 1868, before they retreated to Yedo (now Tokio). Hideyoshi devoted himself sedulously to the improvement of the town, laying out new streets and causing the wealthy merchants of Fushumi and Sakai to immigrate thither. Situated in the middle of the richest agricultural district of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, the growth of Osaka has been unceasing during the last three centuries, although its commercial supremacy was for a time imperilled when the seat of government was transferred from Kioto to Yedo (1868). In 1871 a mint was established in Osaka, its management being entrusted to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> officials. The port was opened to foreign trade in 1868, but, as the harbour was poor and unsuitable for large vessels, Kobe (20 miles west) attracted most of the foreign commerce especially after the establishment of railway connection between the cities in 1873. At present, however, an extensive scheme of improvement to render the harbour capable of accomodating the largest vessels is being executed, and, on its completion, Osaka will take first place in foreign, as in internal commerce. Judging from the rapid growth of its population (821,235 in 1898; 1,226,590 in 1908), Osaka should be in the near future the real <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>. Intersected by a myriad of canals, the city is often called the "Venice of the East", while its numerous industries, among which cotton-spinning occupies a leading position, has won it the title of the "Manchester of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>".

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> embraces the territory stretching from Lake Biwa and the confines of the imperial provinces of Jetchidzen, Mino, and Owari to the western shores of the island of Nippon, together with the adjacent islands (except Shikoku) belonging to this territory. While it was <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier's</a> intention to proceed directly to Miyako (the modern Kioto), then the religious and political capital of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, it was not until 1559 that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was first preached in the territory by Father Gaspar Vilela, S.J., founder of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Miako. After converting about one hundred natives and fifteen bonzes, a plot against his life necessitated his temporary withdrawal, and the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, which for some years devastated the capital, afforded little opportunity for cultivating further the seeds of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Peace being restored, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> began again to make headway, and in September, 1564, we find five churches erected in the neighbourhood of the capital. By 1574 the number of faithful included many in the shogun's palace and even one of his brothers-in-law. Between 1577 and 1579 the converts in the Miako region were estimated at between 9000 and 10,000. In 1582 the central provinces contained 25,000 <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, ministered to by five fathers and nine brothers of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Order</a>. When Hideyoshi determined to transfer the seat of government from Kioto to Osaka, Father Organtino, S.J., in accordance with the advice of Justus Ukondono, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> noble, petitioned the Taiko for a site for a church. His request was granted and the first church in Osaka was opened at <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, 1583. By 1585 the number of nobles <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at Osaka was sixty-five. On the issue of the Taiko's edict banishing the missionaries and closing the churches (see <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>), there were in the eighteen leagues between Miako and Sakai twenty churches and 35,000 faithful. Though no <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> met with <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> during the first <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, the sufferings of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> terrible; fifty churches and eight residences of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in the central provinces were burned, although the churches in Osaka, Miako, and Sakai were spared. Henceforth until the Taiko's death the ministry had to be carried on secretly. In 1593 the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> embassy from the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> arrived, and erected the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Our Lady of Portiuncula and a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> in Miako. In the next year <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> established the Convent of Bethlehem in Osaka. (Concerning the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> following the San Felipe incident see <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>; Nagasaki, Diocese of.) From Hideyoshi's death (1598) to 1613, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> enjoyed comparative peace. At the court of Hideyori, the successor of Hideyoshi, were numerous <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, several whom commanded his troops during the bombardment of Osaka(1615). A list of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in Miako, Fushumi, Osaka, and Sakai having been drawn up in 1613, a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was published at Miako on 11 Feb., 1614, ordering all to depart within five days. For details of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, for which this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was the signal and which within twenty-five years annihilated the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, consult Deplace, "Le Catholicism au Japon", II (Mechlin, 1909). The first church in Osaka after the reopening of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> to foreigners was erected by Father Cousin (now <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10667c.htm">Nagasaki</a>) in 1869. The <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">agnosticism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japanese</a> and the general laxity of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> constitute formidable obstacles to the growth of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The mission is entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> <a href="../cathen/14079a.htm">Society of Foreign Missions</a>. It was erected into a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> on 16 March, 1888, the present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> being Mgr Jules Chatron (elected 23 July, 1896). According to the latest statistics the diocese counts: 27 missionaries (3 native), 4 Marianite Brothers, 37 catechists, 16 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, 34 stations, 32 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 24 <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, 4 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 419 pupils, 1 high-school with 100 pupils, 5 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> with 228 inmates, 32 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, 3711 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.
