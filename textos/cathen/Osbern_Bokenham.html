<h1>Osbern Bokenham</h1>  

<p>(Bokenam)</p>

<p>English Augustinian friar and poet, b. 1393 (the year in which the most famous of English Augustinians, John Capgrave, was also born); d. probably, in 1447. The assertion of Horstmann, his German editor, that Bokenham was born at Bookham, Surrey, appears to be contradicted by the friar's own statement that his birthplace was in the vicinity of a "pryory of blake [black] canons" which Mr. Sydney Lee (Dict. Nat. Biogr., V, 314) identifies with a famous house of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian canons</a> at Bokenham, now Old Buckenham, Norfolk. Bokenham may or may not have got some early schooling from these "blake canons", but he certainly spent five year as a young man in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, chiefly at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, making frequent <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to the great Italian centres of devotional life, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, of course, among them. His long residence in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, in a generation to which the memory of <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> (d. 1374) was still recent, must have been in itself something of a liberal <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Bokenham is known to have read both Cicero and Ovid &mdash; classical accomplishments not by any means a matter-of-course with young Englishmen destined to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a> in those days. Lydgate (d. 1451?) was among his contemporaries; Gover (d. 1402) and <a href="../cathen/03642b.htm">Chaucer</a> (d. 1400) had been living in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in his boyhood, and had demonstrated the splendid possibilities of a language which for more than three centuries had been a mere rustic vernacular. His admission to the Order of Hermit-Friars of St. Augustine, whatever the exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, certainly fell within the period of the order's greatest <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> activity in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, when Dr. John Lowe (d., <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Rochester, 1436) was making such valuable additions to the great Austin-Friars <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. Bockenham finally became a professed religious in the Augustinian <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Stoke Clare, Suffolk.

<p>His writings were chiefly religious in theme and feeling. A "Dialogue" (printed in vol. VI of Dugdale's "Monasticon"), on the genealogy of a great Suffolk <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, is attributed to Bokenham on internal evidence. The "Lyvys of Seyntys" he compiled chiefly from the "Legenda aurea" of Jacobus &acirc; Voragine. Those are the lives of twelve <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, with an account of the legendary "11,000 virgins". Though valuable in a devotional sense, the "Lyvys of Seyntys" cannot be very seriously considered by modern hagiologists; but as illustrating the evolution of <a href="../cathen/05458a.htm">English literature</a>, their historical value is inestimable. The language, described by its author as "of Suthfolke speche", is forced into the exotic form of <em>ottava rima</em>. This work, preserved among the Arundel <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, in the British Museum, was printed for the Roxburghe Club in 1835; but Horstmann's edition (vol. I of K&ouml;lbing's "Altenglische Bibliothek') had appeared at Heilbronn two years earlier. Bokenham's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of religious <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> are curiously illustrated by his using the names of several contemporary ladies of high rank as <em>noms de plume</em> to cover his own authorship.
