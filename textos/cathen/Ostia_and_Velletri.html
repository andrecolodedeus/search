<h1>Ostia and Velletri</h1>  

<p>SUBURBICARIAN DIOCESE OF OSTIA AND VELLETRI (OSTIENSIS ET VELITERNENSIS).

<p>Near <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Ostia, now a small borough, was the ancient port of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the first Roman colony founded by Ancus Marcius, chiefly to exploit the salt deposits. Prior to Imperial times, it had no harbour, the mouth of the Tiber affording the only shelter for shipping; the Emperor Claudius, therefore, built an artificial harbour at Ostia, and <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> afterwards built a basin there, and enlarged the canal by which the harbour communicated with the Tiber. Here a new city sprang up, called Portus Romanus, which was embellished by <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a> and other emperors, and connected with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by a new way, the Via Portuensis, along the right bank of the Tiber. With the decay of the Empire, Ostia and Portus decayed, and in the tenth century the basin of Portus had become a marsh. Between 827 and 844 <a href="../cathen/06789b.htm">Gregory IV</a> restored the city, fortified it against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, and gave it the name of Gregoriopolis.

<p><a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> defeated the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> fleet at Ostia in 847, and stretched a chain across the Tiber. Ostia was afterwards fortified by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Cardinal Ugolino</a> (<a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>), by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere (Julius II)</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, while <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>, in 1612, reopened the basin north of the Tiber. Excavations at Ostia were begun under <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>; they disclosed the forum, a theatre, three <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, the sanctuaries of <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithra</a> and of the Magna Mater, the emporium, and a great many inscriptions.

<p>Not counting St. Cyriacus, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and Maximus the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who, according to the Acts of St. Laurence, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Pope Dionysius in 269, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ostia was Maximus, A.D. 313. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from St. Augustine that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ostia sometimes <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. St. Monica died at Ostia, and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Aurea, though her body was transferred, later, to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The great <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> which St. Gallicanus built at Ostia was a noted establishment. As early as 707, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ostia resided at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, holding the office of <em>bibliothecarius sanct&aelig; ecclesi&aelig;</em>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> later on employed them in the administration of the Universal Church, especially in legations. They were among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who took turns in exercising the pontifical functions during vacancies of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and who became known as <em>episcopi cardinales</em>, or <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">"cardinal bishops"</a>. Among the Bishops of Ostia were Georgius, who in 755 accompanied <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Stephen III</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; Donatus, who was sent by <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> to Constantinople in 866 to deal with the case of Photius, but was stopped at the Byzantine frontier. In 869 this Donatus was head of the legation to the Council of Constantinople and to <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>. Others were: Blessed Gregory (1037); <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a> (1058); Gerard of Ch&acirc;tillon (1072) and Otho of Ch&acirc;tillon (<a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a>) (1077), who served as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> on various occasions, and were both <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by Henry IV; Leo Marsicanus, also called Ostiensis (1101), the chronicler; Lambert Faganini (1117) (Honorius II); Alberic (1135), <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in the Holy Land, where he presided over the Council of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and also in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Hugo (1150) was the first to bear the double title of Ostia and Velletri.

<p>Velletri (Velitr&aelig;) is an ancient city of the Volscians, which, in 494 B. C., became a Latin colony, but revolted in 393, and was among the first of Rome's enemies in the Latin War, for which reason, in 338, the walls of the town were destroyed, while its inhabitants were taken to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to people the Trastevere, their lands being distributed among colonists. Velletri was the home of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a>. In its later history, the battle of Velletri (1744) is famous. The cemetery near the Villa Borgia shows the great antiquity of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in this region. The first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Velletri was Adeodatus (about 464); Joannes, in 592, was entrusted by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> with the care of the Diocese of Tres Tabern&aelig; (Three Taverns), now Cisterna (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">A<font size=-2>LBANO</font></a>). From the eighth century, Velletri again had <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of its own; of whom the last recorded was Joannes (868). Another see, united with Velletri, is that of Norma (Norba); its territory is a deserted, malarial country; only one of its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who lived in the tenth century, is known. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Velletri, before the union of the sees, were Gaudiosus (Gaudericus), one of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to the Council of Constantinople (869), and Joannes, who, in 1058, usurped the pontifical Throne, under the name of <a href="../cathen/02429b.htm">Benedict X</a>.

<p>Among the successors of Hugo in the united <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> were Ubaldo Allucingoli (Lucius III); Ugolino de'Conti, 1206 (<a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>); Rinaldo de'Conti (<a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a>); Petrus a Tarantasia, O.P., 1272 (<a href="../cathen/08018a.htm">Innocent V</a>); Latino Malabranca Orsini (1278), a great statesman and diplomat; Nicol&ograve; Boccasino, O.P. (<a href="../cathen/02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a>); Nicol&ograve; da Prato, the pacifier of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> (1304). During the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> period, all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Ostia were <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a>, residing at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> or serving as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>; the most famous of them was Pierre d'Etain (1373), who persuaded <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a> to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, each of the rival <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> appointed a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ostia. Among the legitimate <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> may be mentioned William of Estouteville (1461), who built the episcopal palace; <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Giuliano della Rovere (Julius II)</a>; Alessandro Farnese, 1524 (<a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>); Gian Pietro Carafa, 1534 (<a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>); Alessandro Farnese (1580), who restored the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; Antonio M. Sauli (1623), founder of a <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; Domenico Ginnasio (1683), who restored the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and founded a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> at Ostia; <a href="../cathen/11380b.htm">Bartholommeo Pacca</a>; Louis Micara (1844).

<p>The united <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> have 16 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, with 34,000 inhabitants, 5 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men and 5 of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishment</a> for male students, and 3 for girls.
