<h1>Otranto</h1>  

<p>ARCHDIOCESE OF OTRANTO (HYDRUNTINA).

<p>Otranto is a city of the Province of <a href="../cathen/09107d.htm">Lecce</a>, Apulia, Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, situated in a fertile region, and once famous for its breed of horses. It was an ancient Greek colony, which, in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of Pyrrhus and of Hannibal, was against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. As it is the nearest port to the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea, it was more important than <a href="../cathen/02787e.htm">Brindisi</a>, under the Roman emperors. In the eighth century, it was for some time in the possession of Arichis, Duke of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> (758-87). Having come again under Byzantine rule, it was among the last cities of Apulia to surrender to <a href="../cathen/07072b.htm">Robert Guiscard</a> (1068), and then became part of the Principality of <a href="../cathen/14450d.htm">Taranto</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> there. In 1480 there occurred the sack of Otranto by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, in which 12,000 men are said to have perished &mdash; among them, Bishop Stephen Pendinelli, who was sawn to death; the "valley of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>" still recalls that dreadful event. On other occasions, as in 1537, the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> landed at Otranto, but they were repulsed. In 1804, the city was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to harbour a French garrison that was established there to watch the movements of the English fleet; and in 1810, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> gave Otranto in fief to Fouch&eacute;.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Otranto is a work of Count Roger I (1088), and was adorned later (about 1163), by Bishop Jonathas, with a <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> floor; the same Count Roger also founded a <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Basilian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> here, which, under Abbot Nicetas, became a place of study; its <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was nearly all bought by <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion</a>. The first known <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of this see was Petrus, to whom <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> refers in 596; and there is record of his two successors; they were Sabinus (599) and Petrus (601); Bishop Marcus (about 807) is believed to be the author of the office for <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>; Petrus (958) was raised to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> by Polyeuctus, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople (956-70), with the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to establish the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> throughout the province. The <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> was introduced again after the Norman conquest, but the <a href="../cathen/06774a.htm">Greek Rite</a> remained in use in several towns of the archdiocese and of its suffragans, until the sixteenth century. Bishop Jacob IV (1378), also <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, had a part in the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of the West, for which reason he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by Charles of Anjou, and compelled to <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjure</a> publicly; after that, however, he betook himself to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>; Peter Anthony of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a> (1536) distinguished himself at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>; Francis M. dall'Aste (1596) was author of "Memorabilia Hydruntin&aelig; Ecclesi&aelig;".

<p>In 1818 Castro, formerly a suffragan of Otranto, was united to it. Castro's <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are known from 1137; among them was John Parisi, killed in 1296 by Canon Hector, of Otranto.

<p>The suffragans of Otranto are <a href="../cathen/06366c.htm">Gallipoli</a>, <a href="../cathen/09107d.htm">Lecce</a>, and Ugento; the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdiocese</a> has 56 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 100,200 inhabitants, 4 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> of men, 11 of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys, and 9 for girls.
