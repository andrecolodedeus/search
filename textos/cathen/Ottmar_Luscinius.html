<h1>Ottmar Luscinius</h1>  

<p>(NACHTGALL)

<p>An Alsatian Humanist, b. at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, 1487; d. at <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, 1537. After receiving instruction at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> from Jacob Wimppheling, he went in 1508 to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he studied Latin under Faustus Andrelini and Greek under Hieronymus Aleander. He then studied canon law at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and in the last city music also under Wolfgang Grefinger. Subsequently he travelled in <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> and <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, returning to Strasburg in 1514. Here he became associated with Wimppheling and Sebastian Brant and mingled in literary circles. In 1515 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Thomas, and also received a vicariate, as he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In addition he taught both in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the Knights <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. He spread in Strasburg his own enthusiasm for the Greek language and literature, and published Greek manuals, collections of examples, and an edition of Lucian with a translation. In 1515 he also published a book on the elements of music (Institutiones musicae), and in 1516 issued a revised edition of the "Rosella" of Baptista Trovamala's compendium of cases of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. The most important of his later works are: (1) an edition (1518) of the Commentary on the Pauline Epistles, then ascribed to Bishop Haimo of Halberstadt. In the introduction Luscinius condemns <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> and champions the study of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>; (2) an exposition and translation of the Psalms (1524); (3) a harmony of the Gospels in Latin and German (1523-25); (4) the dialogue "Grunnius sophista" (1522), a defence of Humanistic studies; (5) a collection of anecdotes called "Loci ac sales mire festivi" (1524), written chiefly for scholarly circles and intended rather to entertain than to be satirical. It contains extracts from Greek and Roman authors, quotations from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>, and moral applications which consort but ill with the many coarse jests.

<p>Luscinius went to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and there received the degree of Doctor of Law. In 1520 he lost his position at St. Thomas's, and failed to obtain a <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebend</a> which he had expected, but he was soon made a canon of St. Stephen's at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>. In 1523 he went to <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, and there became a teacher of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and of Greek at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Ulrich. Although a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> Humanist and an opponent of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a>, Luscinius did not become a supporter of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. For a time, however, he certainly seems to have been friendly to it, and to have approved of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone. But disputes, which he held to be specious quibbling over words, were distasteful to him, and thus at the beginning he avoided taking sides. After 1525, however, he was regarded as a reliable adherent of the ancient Church. The Fugger made him preacher at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Moriz, and he became the most important champion of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> arousing the ill-will of the Evangelical party. In 1528, after he had repeatedly called the Evangelical preachers <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, he was arrested and confined to his own house. In 1529 he was made <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> preacher at <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> im Breisgau. Towards the end of his life he wished to enter the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> near <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, but he was prevented by death. Luscinius was a very talented and versatile man &mdash; <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, jurist, musician, and a widely known scholar in "the three languages".
