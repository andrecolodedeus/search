<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Otto II</h1>  

<p>King of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> and Emperor of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, son of <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> and Adelaide, b. 955; d. in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 7 Dec., 983. In 961 he was elected king at Worms, and was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> at <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, 26 May. Frail in body, he possessed an intrepid and arbitrary spirit. With him began that extravagant policy of imperialism, which aimed at restoring the world boundaries of the ancients, and to encompass the Ancient Sea (the Mediterranean). <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> were to wield the balance of power. Reacting against this imperialistic policy was the revived strength of particularism. The conflict with the ducal House of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> gave a dangerous aspect to affairs. In <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (with Otto's approval) the duchess dowager Judith acted as regent for her son Henry. Upon coming of age he was given the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> in fee by Otto II, who, at the same time, invested Ludolph's son Otto with Swabia on the death of Duke Burchard, ignoring the latter's <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, Hedwig, a daughter of Judith. Henry, named the "Quarrelsome", supported by Abraham of Friesing, Boleslaw of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, and Mesislav of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, opposed this. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> finally ended by Judith being immured in a <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> and Henry declared to have forfeited his duchy. Ludolph's son Otto received the vacant ducal throne. The Eastmark was separated from <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and given in fee to Luitpold of Babenberg, who laid the foundation of the future renown of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. In 978 Lothair, who aspired to the acquisition of Western <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, invaded Lorraine, and pillaged Aix where Otto narrowly escaped capture. But Lothair did not advance further. In Dortmund a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of reprisal was at once decided upon; with 60,000 men, Otto marched upon <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, which he failed to take. Lothair, however, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to come to terms, and in 980 the two kings met near Sedan, where Otto obtained an agreement securing the former boundaries.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Crescentius, a son of Theodora, headed a disorderly factional government and sought to settle the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> by coercion. Otto crossed the Alps and freed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. While in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> his mind became imbued with dreams of ancient imperialism; he would give his imperialistic policy a firm foundation by bringing all <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> under subjection. In Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> united against the German pretensions, and in 982 the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with these ancient powers commenced. <a href="../cathen/14450d.htm">Tarentum</a> fell into the hands of the German king, but 15 July, 982, he was defeated near Capo Colonne, not far from <a href="../cathen/04422c.htm">Cotrone</a>. This battle resulted in the surrender of Apulia and Calabria and destroyed the prestige of the imperial authority throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The effect spread to the people of the North and the turbulent <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> on the East, and shortly after the Danes and Wends rose up in arms. But Otto was victorious. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mission, under the leadership of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a>, had made great progress in the territory of the Magyars. Then came the defeat in Calabria, whereupon all of Slavonia, particularly the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> part, revolted against German sovereignty. The promising beginnings of German and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> culture east of the Elbe, inaugurated by Otto, were destroyed. In <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization was thoroughly established, but the emperor was unable to support the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whom he had placed there. On the Havel and the Spree <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was almost annihilated. Affairs were in equally bad condition among the Wends. The reign of Otto II has been justly called the period of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> for the German Church. The missions which had been organized by <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> were, with few exceptions, destroyed. Otto II now renewed the despotic policy towards the Saxonian border nobles and incited open discontent. In 983 he held an Imperial Diet where his son was elected king as <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> and where the assembled nobles pledged their support. He departed with high hopes for Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Fortune seemed to favour the imperial leaders, who expected to wipe out the disgrace suffered in the south. He chose a new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Peter of Pavia (<a href="../cathen/08427b.htm">John XIV</a>). While in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he was stricken with malaria and was buried in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. At the time of his death the relations of the empire towards the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> were still undefined. He had been unable to maintain his political ascendency in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His imperialistic policy had placed the restraints of progressive and pacific <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and Germanization on the borders; and he, pursuing fanciful dreams, believed that he might dare to transfer the goal of his policy to the south.
