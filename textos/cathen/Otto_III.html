<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Otto III</h1>  

<p>German king and Roman emperor, b. 980; d. at Paterno, 24 Jan., 1002. At the age of three he was elected king at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, in very restless times. Henry the Quarrelsome, the deposed Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, claimed his guardianship. This nobleman wished for the imperial crown. To further his object he made an alliance with Lothair of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Williger, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, the leader of Otto's party, improved the situation. He induced Henry to release the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> king, for which his Duchy of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> was restored. Otto's mother, Theophano, now assumed the regency. She abandoned her husband's imperialistic policy and devoted herself entirely to furthering an alliance between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. Her policy bore a broad national stamp. On her husband's death, this princess styled herself simply "Emperor" in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, though she was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> for political reasons to acknowledge Crescentius as Patrician by her personal presence in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 989. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> Louis V had died without heirs, and <a href="../cathen/07515c.htm">Hugh Capet</a> was elected. This was the work of the French episcopate. Theophano was not able to prevent <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> from speedily freeing herself from German influence. The regent endeavoured to watch over the national questions of the Empire in the East. One of the greatest achievements of this empress was her success in maintaining <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> supremacy over <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>.

<p>After her death, the less capable Adelaide assumed the regency. Unlike her predecessor, hers was not a nature fitted to rule; the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> rose on the eastern border, and the Normans were with difficulty held in check. She died in 999. The influence of these two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the young king (who assumed the government in 994) was not slight. But two men exercised even greater influence on him: Johannes Nonentula, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Theophano, and Bernward of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>. The austere Bernward awakened in him inclinations to fanciful enthusiasm which coloured his dreams of empire.

<p>Supported by the spiritual princes of the Empire, he marched into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Here he behaved as though the Roman see were a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> under the Empire. He it was who presided at <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> and dared to revoke <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decisions, and who selected the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. Like <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, he was convinced of the spiritual character of his imperial dignity, and <a href="../cathen/04674a.htm">deduced</a> from this the necessity of setting the empire over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. He raised a German, Bruno, to the Chair of Peter under the name of <a href="../cathen/06790a.htm">Gregory V</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Otto emperor 21 May, 996, but he did not act counter to the ancient claims of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>, and he emphasized the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>.

<p>Otto returned to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 996. It was of the greatest consequence that in Bruno the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne contained a man who encouraged the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the reform party for purification and spiritualization within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and a consequent exaltation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. Harmonizing with this reform party was the ascetic movement within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whose principal exponent was a native of Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> called Nilus. Among his pupils was the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a>, Adalbert, second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, who was at that time in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> devoting himself entirely to mystical and ascetic enthusiasm. In 996 Otto met this remarkable man whom he succeeded in sending back to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. As he scrupled returning to <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, he went as missionary to the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> country, where he was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> in 999. The emperor was affected by the grotesque <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of this man, and it had aroused ascetic inclinations in him also. Still another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> obtained great influence over him: the learned <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchman</a>, Gerbert, who came to the Imperial court in 997.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, meanwhile, Crescentius had set up an <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> named <a href="../cathen/08428a.htm">John XVI</a> and forced <a href="../cathen/06790a.htm">Gregory V</a> to flee. In 998 Otto went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he pronounced severe judgment upon those who had rebelled against his decisions. <a href="../cathen/06790a.htm">Gregory</a> died in 999, and the emperor raised his friend Gerbert to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> as Sylvester II. He too, followed the ancient path of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>, and advocated <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy over all <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. How was this consistent and energetic policy of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> to affect the youthful emperor's dreams of a fusion of the ideal state with the ideal church in an Augustan Theocracy? The interference with Italian affairs was now to react bitterly upon <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In 1000 Otto made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of his friend Adelbert at <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>, where he erected an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> destined to promote the emancipation of the Eastern Slavonians. He practised <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortifications</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of an ascetic, and thrilled with the highest <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of his imperial dignity, he afterwards caused the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> at <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a> to be opened. Before long his dreams of empire faded away. Everywhere there was fermentation throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Otto, lingering in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, found himself, with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to abandon the city. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the princes united in a national opposition to the new imperialism of this capricious sovereign. He had few supporters in his plan to reconquer the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>. Only by recourse to arms could his body be brought to <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, where recently his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> has been discovered in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.
