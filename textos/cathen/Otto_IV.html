<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Otto IV</h1>  

<p>German king and Roman emperor, b. at Argentau (Dept. of Orne), c. 1182; d. 19 May, 1218; son of Henry the Lion and of his wife Mathilda, daughter of King Henry II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and sister of <a href="../cathen/13041b.htm">Richard Coeur de Lion</a>. In the latter, by whom he was made Earl of March, Otto found a constant support. This connexion of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a> with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> encouraged Adolf of Cologne, upon the death of Henry VI and the election of Philip of Swabia by the Hohenstaufens, to proclaim Otto king, which took place in <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, on 9 June, 1198. The next aim of Otto was to obtain the confirmation of his position as head of the kingdom. The power of the Hohenstaufens was, however, too great. Otto and his followers hoped that <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a>, who was hostile to the Hohenstaufens, would espouse Otto's cause in the contest for the German throne. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent</a> awaited developments. To him the individual was of little importance, his chief solicitude being for the recognition of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to decide contested elections to the German throne, and, in consequence, his suzerainty over kingdom and empire. The year 1200 was favourable to Philip. He, however, made the mistake of taking possession of the episcopal See of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in defiance of canonical regulations, whereupon <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent</a> declared for Otto. The year 1201 marked the beginning of energetic action on the part of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> in Otto's behalf. While the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, Guido of <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina</a>, constantly gained new friends to Otto's cause, the "sweet youth" (<em>s&uuml;sse junge Mann</em>), as Walther von der Vogelweide calls Philip, remained inactive, protesting the while at the attitude of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. When, in 1203, <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a> and <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> also deserted him, Philip's affairs were nearly hopeless. Otto had made the broadest concessions to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, wishing "to become King of the Romans through the favour of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>". He confirmed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> in its secular possessions, relinquished the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of Mathilda of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, and even guaranteed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the revenues of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. He resigned all claims to dominion in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, promising to treat with the Romans and with the cities of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> only in concurrence with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The purpose of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent</a> to become the overlord of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was thus all but accomplished. The moral results of this great contest for the throne were unfortunate. Princes and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> shamelessly changed their party allegiance.

<p>In 1204 the scale turned in Philip's favour. This was due to the fact that the whole north-western part of the kingdom became involved in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> for the succession in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and could therefore manifest but little interest in the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a>. The year 1205 saw a general desertion from Otto's cause, his dominion being finally limited to the city of Cologne and his possessions in <a href="../cathen/03019a.htm">Brunswick</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, Adolf, had also gone over to Philip's standard, upon which sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> had been pronounced against him. The Diocese of Cologne was then subjected to all the confusion of a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. In addition the city of Cologne finally fell into the hands of the Hohenstaufens. Without further delay, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> withdrew his support from the apparently lost cause of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a>, and began negotiations with the Hohenstaufens, in which he was joined by the other cities of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. After mutual concessions, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> promised to acknowledge Philip and to crown him emperor. When about to deal the last crushing blow to the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a>, Philip was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> by the Count Palatine Otto von Wittelsbach at <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, on 21 June, 1208. The princes now rallied round Otto, who had shown his recognition of their right of election by coming forward once more as a candidate for the crown. Otto's next step was to take as his wife the daughter of his <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> enemy, which was an added incentive to the Hohenstaufens to yield themselves to his sway. On 11 November, 1208, he was once more elected, this time at <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a>, which event was followed by a period of mutual understanding and a short term of peace for the kingdom. To ensure the support of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Otto drew up a charter at <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a> on 22 March, 1209, in which he renewed the concessions previously made, and added others. He now promised not to prevent appeals regarding <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs being made to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Of the greatest significance was his act acknowledging the exclusive right of election of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter. In 1209 Otto journeyed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to receive the imperial crown. On this occasion he did not come as a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> petitioner, but as German king to order the affairs of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and to bring about the re-establishment of its relations with his kingdom. As soon as the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> was an accomplished fact (4 Oct., 1209), it was apparent that he intended to make the policy of the Hohenstaufens his own. His first step was to lay claim to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who must have feared a re-establishment of the dominion of Henry VI in lower <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Otto on 18 October, 1210, and determined to place the young Hohenstaufen, <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, upon the throne. The latter secured the support of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and thus succeeded once more in winning the German princes to his cause. On the death of Otto's wife, a Hohenstaufen princess, the Hohenstaufen party completely abandoned his standard for that of Frederick. The renewed conflict between the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a> and the Hohenstaufens was not decided in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, but abroad. Conditions in the kingdom were so changed that foreign arms were destined to decide the contest for the German crown. So crushing was the defeat inflicted upon the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> and English forces by <a href="../cathen/12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a> at Bouvines (27 July, 1214), that Otto's cause was lost. Although he endeavoured in 1217 and 1218 to make a further effort to secure the throne, he met with no great success. Absolved from his <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, he died on 19 May, 1218, and was buried at St. Blasien in Brunswick.
