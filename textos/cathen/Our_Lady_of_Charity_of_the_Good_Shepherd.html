<h1>Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd</h1>  

<p>The aim of this institute is to provide a shelter for girls and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of dissolute habits, who wish to do penance for their iniquities and to lead a truly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life. Not only <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> penitents but also those consigned by civil or <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parental</a> authority are admitted. Many of these penitents desire to remain for life; they are admitted to take <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and form the class of <a href="../cathen/09524a.htm">"magdalens"</a>, under the direction of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd. They are an austere contemplative community, and follow the Rule of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of Mount Carmel. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a>, penance and manual labour are their principal occupations. Many of these <a href="../cathen/09524a.htm">"magdalens"</a> frequently rise to an eminent degree of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. Besides girls and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of this class, the order also admits children who have been secured from danger, before they have fallen or been stained by serious crime. They are instructed in habits of industry and self-respect and in all the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> they owe to themselves and to <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. The "penitents", <a href="../cathen/09524a.htm">"magdalens"</a> and "preservates" form perfectly distinct classes, completely segregated from one another.

<p>The Good Shepherd is a <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloistered</a> order and follows the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>. The constitutions are borrowed in great part from those given by St. Francis of Sales to the Visitation Sisters, but are modified to suit the nature of this work. Besides the three ordinary <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty, chastity and obedience, the Sisters of the Good Shepherd take a fourth <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, namely, to work for the conversion and instruction of "penitents",--a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> which makes this order one of the most beautiful creations of <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">Christian charity</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are renewed every year, for five years, before becoming perpetual. The order is composed of choir sisters, and lay or "converse" sisters. The choir sisters recite every day the <a href="../cathen/09294a.htm">Little Office of the Blessed Virgin</a>. The habit is white, with white <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapulars</a> reminding them of the innocence of the life they should lead. The choir sisters wear a black veil; the "converse" sisters a white veil. Around their necks, they wear a silver heart, on one side of which is engraved an image of "The Good Shepherd" and on the other, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">blessed virgin</a> holding the Divine Infant, between a branch of roses and a branch of lilies. The heart represents that of the sister, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> and to her <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Divine Son</a> and the roses and lilies are symbolical of the virtues of charity and purity. The order is dedicated in an especial manner to the Holy Heart of Mary and to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which are its two patrons. Besides the choir sisters and the "converse" sisters, the order also admits "Touri&egrave;re" Sisters, who attend to the door and perform <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. Their habit is black, and they take only the three ordinary <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>.

<p>The Institute of the Good Shepherd is a branch of "Our Lady of Charity of the Refuge", founded by Blessed John Eudes, at <a href="../cathen/03132a.htm">Caen</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1641, and approved by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a>, 2 January, 1666, its constitutions being approved by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, in 1741. The order as primitively organized by blessed John Eudes still exists in a flourishing state, under the first title of "Our Lady of Charity of the Refuge", and counts about thirty-nine houses and about 1893 sisters. The distinction between the primitive order and its branch, the Institute of "Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd", consists mainly in the administration. According to the custom of his time, the Blessed John Eudes <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> that "Our Lady of the Refuge" should have no mother-house, but that every house founded by this order should be a distinct community, having its own administration, and being united to the other houses only by bonds of fraternal charity.

<p>Among the noble <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who entered the ranks of the Sisters of the refuge in the nineteenth century was one whose name will be long remembered, Mother Mary Euphrasia Pelletier. She was born in the island of Noirmoutier of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, on 31 July 1796, and received in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the name of Rose Virginia. She entered the community of "The Refuge" of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, in 1814, and made her profession in 1816, taking the name of Mary St. Euphrasia. She became first mistress of the penitents, a short time after her profession, and about eight years later was made superioress of the house of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>. Desirous of extending the benefits of her order to the very extremities of the earth, she clearly saw that a central government, a mother-house, should be established.

<p>The house of Angers, which she had founded, seemed destined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for grand designs. He would decide, by the voice of His pontiff. Like many of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> elect, she was treated by her adversaries as an innovator, an ambitious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, impatient of authority. Only after incessant labours and formidable opposition did her cause triumph. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> in approval of the mother-house at Angers was signed 3 April, 1835, and published by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>. The official title of the institute was henceforth "Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd of Angers". It is directly subject to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11206b.htm">Cardinal Odescalchi</a> was its first <a href="../cathen/03341a.htm">cardinal-protector</a>. Angers is authorized to send its sisters to the extremities of the earth. Mother Euphrasia heartily devoted herself to the work entrusted to her. She had been accused of <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, of innovation, and of disobedience. Her sole <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> was to extend <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">God's kingdom</a>, and to offer the benefits of her institute to the whole world. Her innovations, in harmony with the spirit of the Gospel, with the fourth <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of her order, were approved by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and gave in thirty-three years one hundred and ten soul-saving institutions to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Her institutions were all founded in obedience to the requests of <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> in every part of the world. Thirty-three years she was mother-general of the Good Shepherd, and at her death 29 April 1868, she left 2067 professed sisters, 384 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, 309 Touriere sisters, 962 <a href="../cathen/09524a.htm">"Magdalens"</a>, 6372 "penitents", and 8483 children of various classes. Angers had seen great changes since 1829, when Mother Euphrasia had come with five sisters to found the house. Within thirty-three years one hundred and ten <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> had been founded, sixteen provinces established, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chili</a>. Under her successor, Mother Mary St. Peter Coudenhove, in twenty-four years, eighty-five houses were founded, and thirteen new provinces established, making eleven in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, two in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, nine in North America, five in South America and one in the Oceania.

<p>The cause of the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> of Mother Euphrasia was inscribed by the postulator of the cause, 17 Nov., 1886. The preliminary examination terminated in 1890. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> received supplications from numerous <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, several <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters, rectors of colleges, and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, hundreds of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and many noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, begging him to dispense from ordinary ten years' interval required before the continuation of the cause. On 11 Dec., 1897, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> declared her "Venerable", to the great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the whole world, and to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and glory of all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the Good Shepherd.

<p>The order glories also in the name of Mother Mary of the Divine Heart, who has been compared to the Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque. The <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> to the Sacred Heart, 9 June, 1899, which <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> referred to as the greatest act of his pontificate, was brought about by her suggestion. She died on the eve of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> (8 June, 1899), at Porto, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and already preparations are being made for her <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a>.
