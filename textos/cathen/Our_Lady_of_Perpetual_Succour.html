<h1>Our Lady of Perpetual Succour</h1>  

<p>(<em>Or</em> OUR LADY OF PERPETUAL HELP.)

<p>The picture of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour is <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> on wood, with background of gold. It is Byzantine in style and is supposed to have been <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in the thirteenth century. It represents the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> holding the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Divine Child</a> while the Archangels Michael and Gabriel present before Him the instruments of His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>. Over the figures in the picture are some Greek letters which form the abbreviated words <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, Archangel Michael, and <a href="../cathen/06330a.htm">Archangel Gabriel</a> respectively. It was brought to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> towards the end of the fifteenth century by a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> merchant, who, dying there, ordered by his will that the picture should be exposed in a church for public veneration. It was exposed in the church of San Matteo, Via Merulana, between St. Mary Major and St. John Lateran. Crowds flocked to this church, and for nearly three hundred years many <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> were obtained through the <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>. The picture was then popularly called the Madonna di San Matteo. The church was served for a time by the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Hermits of St. Augustine</a>, who had sheltered their <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> brethren in their distress. These Augustinians were still in charge when the French invaded <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1812) and destroyed the church. The picture disappeared; it remained hidden and neglected for over forty years, but a series of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> circumstances between 1863 and 1865 led to its discovery in an <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian Fathers</a> at Santa Maria in Posterula.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, who as a boy had <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> before the picture in San Matteo, became interested in the discovery and in a letter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 11 Dec., 1865 to Father General Mauron, C.SS.R., ordered that Our Lady of Perpetual Succour should be again publicly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in Via Merulana, and this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> at the new church of St. Alphonsus. The ruins of San Matteo were in the grounds of the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">Convent</a>. This was but the first favour of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Holy Father</a> towards the picture. He approved of the solemn translation of the picture (26 April, 1866), and its <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15276b.htm">Vatican</a> <a href="../cathen/03582b.htm">Chapter</a> (23 June, 1867). He fixed the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> as <em>duplex secundae classis</em>, on the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> before the <a href="../cathen/10712b.htm">Feast of the Nativity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>, and by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> May, 1876, approved of a special office and Mass for the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer</a>. This favour later on was also granted to others. Learning that the <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to Our Lady</a> under this title had spread far and wide, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> raised a confraternity of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour and St. Alphonsus, which had been erected in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to the rank of an <a href="../cathen/01692a.htm">arch-confraternity</a> and enriched it with many <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileges</a> and <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. He was amongst the first to visit the picture in its new home, and his name is the first in the register of the <a href="../cathen/01692a.htm">arch-confraternity</a>. Two thousand three hundred facsimiles of the Holy Picture have been sent from St. Alphonsus's church in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to every part of the world. At the present day not only altars, but churches and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> (e.g. in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/09112a.htm">Leeds</a> and Middlesborough; in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> <a href="../cathen/13488a.htm">Savannah</a>) are <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to Our Lady of Perpetual Succour. In some places, as in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the title has been translated Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
