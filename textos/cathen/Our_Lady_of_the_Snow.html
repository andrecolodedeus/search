<h1>Our Lady of the Snow</h1>  

<p>("Dedicatio Sanct&aelig; Mari&aelig; ad Nives").

<p>A feast celebrated on 5 August to commemorate the dedication of the church of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Maggiore on the Esquiline Hill in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The church was originally built by <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Pope Liberius</a> (352-366) and was called after him "Basilica Liberii" or "Liberiana". It was restored by <a href="../cathen/14032a.htm">Pope Sixtus III</a> (432-440) and dedicated to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>. From that time on it was known as "Basilica S. Mari&aelig;" or "Mari&aelig; Majoris"; since the seventh century it was known also as "Maria ad Pr&aelig;sepe". The appellation "ad Nives" (of the snow) originated a few hundred years later, as did also the legend which gave this name to the church. The legend runs thus: During the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a>, the Roman patrician John and his wife, who were without heirs, made a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to donate their possessions to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our lady</a>. They <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to her that she might make known to them in what manner they were to dispose of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. On 5 August, during the night, snow fell on the summit of the Esquiline Hill and, in obedience to a vision which they had the same night, they built a) basilica, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, on the spot which was covered with snow. From the fact that no mention whatever is made of this alleged <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> until a few hundred years later, not even by <a href="../cathen/14032a.htm">Sixtus III</a> in his eight-lined dedicatory inscription [edited by de Rossi, "Inscript. Christ.", II, I (Rome, 1888), 71; Grisar (who has failed to authenticate the alleged <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>), "Analecta Romana", I (Rome, 1900), 77; Duchesne, <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, I (Paris, 1886), 235; Marucchi, "El&eacute;ments d'arch&eacute;ologie chr&eacute;tienne", III (Paris and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1902), 155, etc.] it would seem that the legend has no historical basis. Originally the feast was celebrated only at Sta Maria Maggiore; in the fourteenth century it was extended to all the churches of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and finally it was made a universal feast by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>. <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> raised it from a feast of double rite to double major. The mass is the common one for feasts of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>; the office is also the common one of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Bl. Virgin</a>, with the exception of the second <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturn</a>, which is an account of the alleged <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. The congregation, which <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> instituted for the reform of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> in 1741, proposed that the reading of the legend be struck from the Office and that the feast should again receive its original name, "Dedicatio Sanct&aelig; Mari&aelig;".
