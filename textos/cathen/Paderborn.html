<h1>Paderborn</h1>  

<p>(Paderbornensis)

<p>Suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Cologne, includes: the District of <a href="../cathen/10323a.htm">Minden</a>, <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, except the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Lette; the District of Arnsberg, <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, except a few <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Saxony; five districts in the Rhine Province; the Principality of Lippe; the Principality of Waldeck; the Duchy of Gotha; the Principalities of Schwartzburg-Rudolstadt and Schwartzburg-Sondershausen; and the Vicariate Apostolic of Anhalt (see <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, map). The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is divided into 53 deaneries. There are 547 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (20 missionary, 266 succursal); 1403 secular and 93 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular priests</a>; 1,508,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and 5,250,000 non-Catholics. The part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in Thuringia is also divided among three other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administrative districts: the episcopal commissaries of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> and Heiligenstadt, and the "Ecclesiastical Court" (<em>Geistilches Gericht</em>) of Erfurt.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter has the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to elect the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; it consists of a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, a dean, 8 capitular and 4 honorary canons; 6 <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> vicars are stationed at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> institutes are: the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> institute of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> with 8 professors, the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> college (<em>Collegium Leoninum</em>), the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys (<em>Collegium Liborianum</em>) at Paderborn, the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys (<em>Collegium Bonifatianum</em>) at Heiligenstadt, and the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan's</a> home of <a href="../cathen/09276a.htm">Lippe</a> at Paderborn. Under religious direction also are the boy's colleges of Warburg, Attendorn, and Brilon.

<p>The orders existing in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, 8 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, 69 fathers, 21 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, 68 brothers; <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, 5 fathers, 4 brothers; <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, 8 fathers, 7 brothers; <a href="../cathen/13306a.htm">Missionaries of the Sacred Heart of Jesus</a>, 1 community, 11 fathers, 51 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, 21 brothers. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> orders and congregations, which have 256 institutions with 3320 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>, include: the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Sisters of Perpetual Adoration, 2 priorates; Canonesses of St. Augustine, 1 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>; Poor School Sisters of Notre Dame, 3 institutions; <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>, 3 houses; <a href="../cathen/03711a.htm">Sisters of Christian Charity</a>; Daughters of the Blessed Virgin Mary of the Immaculate Conception, mother-house at Paderborn and 15 institutions; Sisters of Charity of the Christian Schools, mother-house at Heiligenstadt, and 6 institutions; Sisters of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, mother-house at Paderborn and 99 houses; Poor <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters of Perpetual Adoration, mother-house at Olpe, 39 institutions; <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, mother-house at Salzkotten, 23 houses; Grey <a href="../cathen/05388a.htm">Sisters of St. Elizabeth</a> from <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, provincial house at Halle, 20 institutions; Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent, from <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, 5 houses; Poor Sisters of St. Francis, from <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, 4 institutions; Sisters of Charity of St. Francis, from M&uuml;nster, 3 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>; Sisters of St. Francis, from Thuine, near Freren, 5 institutions; Poor <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters, from Waldbreitach, 2 institutions; Poor Servants of Jesus Christ, from Dernbach, 18 institutions; Sisters of Clement from M&uuml;nster, 3 houses; <a href="../cathen/03608a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Elizabeth</a>, from Essen, 1 house; <a href="../cathen/07405b.htm">Sisters of the Holy Cross</a> from <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, 2 institutions; Daughters of Christian Charity of St. Vincent from Cologne-Nippes, 1 house; Sisters of Our Lady from M&uuml;lhausen (Rhineland), 1 institutions.

<p>The city of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> is the headquarters of the <a href="../cathen/02671a.htm">Boniface Association</a>; among others are the Society of St. Vincent, the Society of St. Elizabeth, the Mother's Society, the Young Men's Society, the Young Women's Sodalities, the Society of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, etc. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions include 120 institutions for the protection of children; 50 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>; 100 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for handicrafts and domestic <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>; 135 sanatoria and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>; 65 stations for visiting nurses; and 300 religious homes for the poor. Among the newspapers are: the "Westf&auml;lisches Volksblatt" the Sonntagsblatt Leo", the "Bonifatiusblatt" and the scientific magazine, "Theologie und Glaube". The most important churches are: the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Paderborn, which in its present form dates from the twelfth and fourteenth centuries; a church with three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> of equal height in the style of the Romanesque and transition periods; the Romanesque <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Patroclus at Soest, built in 954. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Erfurt, dates back to 1153; and the Gothic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/10323a.htm">Minden</a>, built between the eleventh and fifteenth centuries.

<p>The first church at Paderborn was founded in 777, when <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> held a diet there. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that Paderborn was a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in 805 or 806; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Hathumar, a Saxon (d. 815). Before this Paderborn was under the <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">Diocese of W&uuml;rzburg</a>. The Diocese of Paderborn then included the larger part of <a href="../cathen/09276a.htm">Lippe</a>, <a href="../cathen/15527a.htm">Waldeck</a>, and nearly half of the former Countship of Ravensberg.



<p>St. Badurad (815-62) completed the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, encouraged the building of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and the establishment of several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. He received from Louis the Pious special protection for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which was benefited financially, in that henceforward it received all the court fees. When the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> received the countship is unknown, but this was confirmed to Bishop Liuthard (862-86) in 881 by King Louis. <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> bestowed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to a free election of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> upon Bishop Folkmar in 974 (d. 981). In 1000 the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was burnt; Rethgar (d. 1009) began a new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, completed by his successor, <a href="../cathen/10148a.htm">Meinwerk</a>. The latter established the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Monastery of Abdinghof at Paderborn, founded a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> college at Busdorf, and improved the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. During the Strife of Investitures, Poppo (1076-83) was first an adherent of the emperor, later of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Heinrich I, Count of Assel, elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> under the protection of the opposing King Hermann, in 1090 was exiled by the <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Emperor Henry IV</a>, and fled to <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, where in 1102 he was elected <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. The See of Paderborn was occupied by Heinrich II, Count of Werl-Arnsberg, who had had himself installed in 1084 at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by Henry IV, and who had helped in the expulsion of Heinrich I. He received the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sanction in 1106. Bernhard II, Lord of Oesede (1127-60), restored the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (burnt in 1133).

<p>Siegfried (1178-80) lived to see the downfall of Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony. The <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> which the old dukedom had exercised over Paderborn were transferred to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>. The claims of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Cologne were settled in the thirteenth century, almost wholly in favor of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>. Under Bernhard II of Ibbenb&uuml;ren (1198-1204) the bailiwick over the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which since the middle of the eleventh century had been held as a fief by the Counts of Arnsberg, returned to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. This was an important advance in the development of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> position as temporal sovereigns. From this time on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> did not grant the bailiwick as a fief, but managed it themselves, and had themselves represented in the government by one of their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. They strove successfully to obtain the bailiwicks over the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> situated in their diocese. During the reign of Bernhard IV (1228-47). The <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a> settled in the diocese. Under him the community life of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> canons ceased completely, and the canons, twenty-four in number, shared with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, archdiaconates, and obediences (1231).

<p>Simon I, Lord of Lippe (1247-77), was engaged in struggles with Cologne; Otto von Rietberg had also to contend with Cologne; in 1281, when only bishop-elect, he received the regalia from Rudolph of Habsburg, and full judicial power (except penal judicature); henceforward the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were actual sovereigns, though not over the whole of their diocese. Bernhard V of Lippe (1321-41) had to acknowledge the city of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> as free from his judicial supremacy. Heinrich III Spiegel zum Desenberg (1361-80), also <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Corvey, left his spiritual functions to a suffragan; in 1371 he rebuilt the Burg Neuhaus at Paderborn. Simon II, Count of Sternberg (1380-89), involved the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> in feuds with the nobility, who after his death devastated the country. Wilhelm Heinrich van Berg, elected 1399, sought to remedy the evils which had crept in during the foregoing feuds, but when in 1414 he interested himself in the vacancy in the Archbishopric of Cologne, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter in his absence chose Dietrich von M&ouml;rs (1415-63). The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of Dietrich, also <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, brought heavy <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>; during the feuds of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with the city of Soest (1444-49) Paderborn was devastated. The reign of Simon III of Lippe (1463-89) was occupied with the correction of Church discipline. Herman I, Landgrave of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a> (1495-1508), was an excellent ruler.

<p>Under Erich, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen (1502-32), the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> obtained a foothold in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, although the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> remained loyal to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Hermann von Wied (1532-47), also <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, sought to introduce the new teaching at Paderborn as well as Cologne, but he was opposed by all classes. The countships of <a href="../cathen/09276a.htm">Lippe</a>, <a href="../cathen/15527a.htm">Waldeck</a>, and Pyrmont, the part of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in the Countship of Ravensberg, and most of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> on the right bank of the Weser became protestant. After the removal of Hermann von Wied, Paderborn had three active <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: Rembert von Kerrsenbrock (1547-68), Johann II von Hoya (1568-1574) published the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine</a> Decrees, and Salentin, Count of Isenberg (1574-77), also <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>. Heinrich IV, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg (1577-85), was a <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>; he permitted the adoption of the Augsberg Confession by his subjects. Apostasy from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> made such advances that in the city of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> only the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and the Monastery of Abdinghof remained faithful. To save the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter summoned the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to Paderborn in 1580. Theodor von F&uuml;rstenberg (1585-1618) restored the practice of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, built a gymnasium for the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and founded the University of Paderborn in 1614.

<p>Ferdinand I of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1618-50) was not able to save the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> from the horrors of the Thirty Years' Was. Theodor Adolf von der Reck (1650-91) tried to repair the damages of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Ferdinand II von F&uuml;rstenberg (1661-83), poet, historian, scholar, and promoter of the arts and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, founded the "Ferdinandea", for the support of thirteen missionaries for the northern Vicariate. Hermann Werner (1683-1704) and his nephew Franz Arnold (1704-18) were admirable <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. Under Klemens August of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> (1719-61), the Seven Years' War wrought great damage. Wilhelm Anton von der Asseberg (1763-82) founded a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in 1777. Franz Egon von F&uuml;rstenberg (1789-1825) lived to see the secularization of nearly all the chapters and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> went to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> became a prince of the empire; but his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> was untouched. He saw the enlargement of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, resulting from the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "De Salute Animarium", 16 July, 1821, which extended Paderborn, and placed it under Cologne.

<p>Friedrich Klemens von Ledebur-Wicheln (1826-41) divided the diocese into deaneries. Konrad Martin (1856-79) held a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod in 1867, and took part in the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a> he stood firmly for the freedom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, suffered many penalties, and died an exile in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>.
