<h1>Padua</h1>  

<p>(Patavina)

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The city is situated on a fertile plain and is surrounded and traversed by the Bachiglione River. Its streets are almost all flanked with <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">colonnades</a>. The most splendid of its <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> is "il Santo", that is, the basilica of <a href="../cathen/01556a.htm">St. Anthony of Padua</a>, begun in 1232; its style is mixed Romanesque and Byzantine, irrespective of later modifications; it has seven <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupolas</a>, and is divided into three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>. On the high alter is a crucifix in bronze by <a href="../cathen/05115d.htm">Donatello</a>, the author also of the bronze <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-reliefs</a> on the walls of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a>; the bronze candelabra are by Andrea Riccio; the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, called "Capella del Santo" (1500-33), is filled with ex-voto offerings, and contains nine base-reliefs by Lombardi, representing <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> and that of San Felice are also full of works of art. The <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> in this church are by <a href="../cathen/09610a.htm">Mantegna</a>, <a href="../cathen/03169b.htm">Paolo Veronese</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14723a.htm">Tiepolo</a>, while the frescoes are by <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a> and Altichiero da Zevia. The <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">Church</a> of Santa Giustina, rebuilt in 1502, is <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> by eight <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupolas</a>, and has fourteen side <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; there are <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/03169b.htm">Paolo Veronese</a>, <a href="../cathen/06564b.htm">Luca Giordano</a>, and Parodio. Beside this church in a famous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, which dates from the ninth century; in the fifteenth century a reform of the order began in this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Santa Giustina, now used as a barracks. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> was destroyed by an earthquake in 1117, and was rebuilt by <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>, who, however, finished only the choir and the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>. The church, called "degli Eremitani" (1264 and 1309), contains frescoes by <a href="../cathen/09610a.htm">Mantegna</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> was founded by Bishop Federico Cornaro in 1577, and was greatly enlarged by Blessed Cardinal Gregorio Barberigo in 1671; connected with it are a printing press and a rich <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>.

<p>Among the secular buildings are the Palazzo della Ragione, dating from 1166, restored in 1218, 1420, and 1756; the Loggia del Consiglio (the palace of the "Capitano"); and the <a href="../cathen/11387a.htm">university</a> (1493), by <a href="../cathen/11423c.htm">Palladio</a> or <a href="../cathen/13453c.htm">Sansovino</a>; annexed to it are a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>, with 2500 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, an anatomical amphitheatre, founded in 1594 by Fabrizio d'Acquapendente, a museum of natural history, a large collection of petrified objects, a botanical garden (1545, first in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>), and an observatory, erected on a tower of the castle of Ezzelino. Among the public monuments are: the equestrian <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Gattamelata by <a href="../cathen/05115d.htm">Donatello</a> on the piazza del Santo; the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Antenor, the legendary founder of the city.

<p>Padua (<em>Patavium</em>) was the chief city of the Veneti, who were continually at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Gauls; the Veneti, therefore, were naturally friends of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 302 BC, Cleonymus, King of <a href="../cathen/14209b.htm">Sparta</a>, sailed up the Po with a part of his fleet; but the Patavians drove him back with a severe loss. The city long enjoyed independence, and obtained Roman citizenship only in 49 BC. Under the first emperors, Padua was one of the most heavily taxed cities. It had a flourishing wool industry, and its people were famous for their orderly conduct. Latin literature also flourished among them (Livy, Ascanius Pedanius, Thrasea P&aelig;tus). With the growth of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> the importance of Padua waned; it was destroyed in 408 by Alaric, in 452 by <a href="../cathen/02061b.htm">Attila</a>, and in 601 by Agilulfus, King of the Lombards. In the tenth century it was harassed by the Hungarians, especially in 903. In 1087, with the consent of Henry IV, Padua made itself a free commune; and in the time of <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> it was among the first cities to establish the Lombard League. It was at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1110 and 1214; with <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> in 1140, 1188, and 1201; and with the Ezzelini. Ezzelino IV succeeded in obtaining the sovereignty in 1237. For eighteen years he exercised a most inhuman tyranny; among his victims was the <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Santa Giustina, Arnaldus, who died after an <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of eight years. In 1256 an army of <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>, sent by <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a>, captured the city, which Ezzelino attempted in vain to recapture.

<p>The city once more flourished; but internal discord developed anew, and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with neighbors began again, with the result that Padua, following the example of other cities, offered the lordship to Jacopo Carrara in 1318. In 1320, however, Padua was compelled to receive an imperial vicar; and the attempt of Marsilio I of Carrara, son of Jacopo (1328), to rid himself of that functionary, turned only to the advantage of the Scaligeri (Alberto and Mastino), which <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> were driven from Padua in 1337 by Marsilio, succeeded by Ubertino. The latter greatly increased the territory of the state, and was succeeded by Marsilio II Papafava, and by Jacopo II (1345) a protector of letters and of the arts, assassinated in 1350 by Gulielmo, natural son of Giacomo I. Francesco I, captain of the league against the Visconti, succeeded, but was unsuccessful against <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and was compelled to accept a humiliating peace; in 1378 he assisted the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of Chiogga. He was more successful, however, against the Scaligeri, from whom he took Feltre, Belluno, <a href="../cathen/15038a.htm">Treviso</a>, and Ceneda (1384). His son Francesco Novello (1388) <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> submitted to the Visconti and took <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> and <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>. In 1404 he made an attempt against <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a> that brought upon him a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. After a long siege, father and son went to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, to obtain favorable conditions of peace, were detained and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> (1405); the rule of the Carrara thus came to an end, and Padua fell to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. In 1509 the Emperor Maximilian I took the city from the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>; the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> having retaken it, the town was besieged again by the imperialists, who had already taken a bastion, when the explosion of a mine drove them back; thenceforth Padua followed the fortunes of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>.

<p>Padua is the birthplace of: the Poetess Isabella Andreini; another poetess Gaspera Stampa; the jurist Jacopo Zabarella, his son <a href="../cathen/15739a.htm">Cardinal Francesco Zabarella</a>, and his nephew Bartolommeo; Ottonello Descalzo; the man of letters Cesarotti; the naturalist Donati; the mechanician Giacomo dell' Orologio; the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> Francesco Squarcione (Paduan <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>), Stefano dall' Arzere; G. B. Bissoni; <a href="../cathen/03220b.htm">Campagnola</a>; Girolamo Padovano; <a href="../cathen/09610a.htm">Mantegna</a>; Alessio Varotari (Il Padovanino); the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> Domenica Scanferla; the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> Tiziano Aspetti; Blessed Pellegrino Manzoni (d. 1267); Blessed Compagno (d. 1264); and of Blessed Cardinal Bonaventura da Padova (d. 1385).

<p>Padua gave a number of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: St. Giustina, Virgin; St. Daniel; and the Bishop Maximus. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is said to have been St. Prosdocimus, who cannot have governed the diocese earlier than the beginning of the third century, when the See of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> was created, even if Crispinus, at the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> in 347, was the twelfth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Padua. After the destruction of the city by <a href="../cathen/02061b.htm">Attila</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> resided in the island of Melamocco, and took part in the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">The Three Chapters</a>; Tricidius (620) returned to Padua, which had again grown up. Among the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Gauslinus, who, in 964, found the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, St Fidentius; Blessed Bernardo Maltraverso (1031); Pietro (1096), deposed by the Council of <a href="../cathen/07053b.htm">Guastalla</a>; St. Bellino Bertaldo, killed in 1147 by Tommaso Capodivacca; Gerardo Marostica (1169), a pacifier. On account of the tyranny of Ezzelino IV, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was vacant from 1239; Pagano della Torre (1302) built the episcopal palace; Ildebrandino (1319), Pontifical <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> on various occasions; Pileo da Prata (1359), founder of the Collegio Pratense; Pietro Barba (1448), <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Pope Paul II</a>; Fantino Dandolo (1449), formerly a high functionary of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>; Jacopo Zeno (1460), the biographer of his uncle Carlo, who commanded in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>; Nicol&ograve; Ormanetto (1570); Giorgio Cornaro (1697) held important charges under the republic; Carlo Rezzonico (1743), <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Pope Clement XIII</a>; Francesco Scipione Doni dall' Orologio (1807). The provincial Synod of 1350 was important.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is suffragan of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>; it has 321 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 570,200 inhabitants, 1 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> daily paper, and one weekly <a href="../cathen/11669b.htm">Catholic publication</a>.
