<h1>Palermo</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdiocese</a> of Palermo (Panormitana), in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>.

<p>The city is built on an inlet of the Mediterranean and is partly surrounded, to the south, by a semicircle of mountains and hills, of which the highest are Catalfano to the east, and Montepellegrino to the west. Among the churches are the Duomo, Built in 1170 by the Archbishop Gualtiero Offamiglio on the site of an ancient basilica which had been changed into a mosque during the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> domination. The walls are decorated with frescoes and <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. In the first <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> on the right are six <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of kings and queens of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. Other objects of interest in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> are <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> by Gagini and by Villareale; an Assumption by <a href="../cathen/15323a.htm">Velasquez</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by well-know masters; the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> with 21 <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Palermo, and the <em>tabularium</em>, or archives with interesting Latin, Greek, and Arabic documents. S. Domenico (1300), restored in 1414 and in 1640 is the largest and one of the most beautiful churches of Palermo; it contains the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of many famous <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilians</a>, also <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Anemolo, Fondulli, Paladino, and Vito d'Anna, as well as <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> by Gagini. In the Olivella (1598) there is a beautiful Madonna, said to be by <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> or by <a href="../cathen/04476b.htm">Lorenzo di Credi</a>. S. Giorgio dei Genovesi, which represents the most beautiful architecture of the sixteenth century in Palermo, has <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by <a href="../cathen/11430a.htm">Palma Vecchio</a>, <a href="../cathen/06564b.htm">Giordano</a>, Paladino, and others. La Badia Nuova has <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Morrealese, by whom also are the frescoes in the vault of the church. At S. Giuseppe there are two admirable crucifixes, one in <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a>, and the other in bronze, works of Fra Umile da Petralia, and also <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by Tancredi, Morrealese and Giuseppe Velasquez. L'Annunziata, called la Martorana, was built by George of Antioch, an admiral of King Roger (twelfth century); it is famous for its <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> and for a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, the Ascension, by Anemolo. At Santa Maria di Ges&ugrave; there are <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of the thirteenth century. Other monumental churches are S. Antonio (1220); S. Matteo (seventeenth century), which as the "Sposalizio" by Novelli; S. Eulalia dei Catalani; Santa Maria la Nuova (1339), which has a fine portico; the church and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> "dei greci", dating, respectively, from 1540 and 1734; S. Cita, connected with the military <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, which has a Madonna by <a href="../cathen/09636c.htm">C. Maratta</a>. d'Aielo, chancellor of King William the Good; S. Caterina; S. Cataldo, which is in the Greco-Norman style; Santa Maria degli Angeli; S.

Giovanni dell' Origlione; the Badia della Magione, of the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a>, which has a Piet&agrave; by Gagini; S. Giacomo la Marina (1336); S. Anna la Misericordia (statutes by Gagini).

<p>Among the secular buildings is the Palazzo Reale, built on the site of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> fortress by the Norman kings. It was a mass of halls, of silk and of wool factories, churches <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, and towers; of the latter, only one remains, that of S. Ninfa, which, since 1791 has been the seat of the <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> observatory. It was from this observatory that Ceres, the first of the asteroids to be observed, was discovered by the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine</a> Padre Piazzi (1801). The Palazzo dei Tribunali was the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the Chiaramonte <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, but was confiscated and served as the seat of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> has a magnificent portico, and contains the Museo Nazionale and also a picture gallery with a Piet&agrave; by <a href="../cathen/13031b.htm">Spagnoletto</a>, a Holy Family by <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a>, a Madonna with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by Ruzzolone, etc. Others buildings are the Sopraintendenza agli Archivi di Stato; the Palazzo Firenze (1578) formerly the custom-house, now used for banks and other institutions; the tower of Palitelli, which dates from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> period; the former college of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, which contains a <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> (now national) of 120,000 volumes and 1269 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>; the private palaces Aiutamicristo, Campofranco (collection of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a>), Trabia (art collection and <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>), Forcella, Butera, and others. There are, moreover, a conservatory of music, several <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> institutes, and two other public <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, one of the commune, and the other of the Oratoria di S. Filippo Neri. Outside the city, are the cave of <a href="../cathen/13184a.htm">St. Rosalia</a>, where her <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were found, which has been transformed into a church; S. Giovanni dei lebbrosi; S. Spirito, where the first episode of the famous <a href="../cathen/15384a.htm">Sicilian Vespers</a> took place; I Cappuccini, with its well-known <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>; the ancient <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Baida on the slopes of Mt Aguzzo.

<p>Palermo is a city of <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Phoenician</a> origin, the name of which means "surrounded by rocky cliffs". In time, it came under the rule of the Carthaginians. In 254, however, the Romans took possession of Palermo. Palermo retained its form of government, but under <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> became a colony; and the Greek language, which under the Carthaginians was the predominant tongue of the city, little by little ceded its place to the Latin. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> obtained possession of Palermo for a time in 820, but in 835 their rule was established permanently. In 1063, the <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a> made an unsuccessful attempt to take Palermo. Finally, Roger, abetted by the treason of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> soldiers in Palermo, took the city in 1071, and made it the capital of his <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> possessions. Under Roger II, it became the capital of the Two Sicilies, and so remained, until the conquest by Charles of Anjou. Under the Normans the arts and letters (Greek, Arabic, and Latin) flourished at Palermo, and the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan religion</a> was tolerated, the kings being only too <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> imitators of the customs of the caliphs. The famous <a href="../cathen/15384a.htm">Sicilian Vespers</a> (31 March, 1282) were the signal of revolt against the Angevin domination, in favour of Peter, King of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, who was hailed as legitimate heir of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of Conradin; and in the new <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Kingdom of Sicily</a>, Palermo again became a capital. At the death of <a href="../cathen/09723c.htm">Martin I</a> (1409) <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> was united with the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Kingdom of Aragon</a>, and at Palermo was governed by its own viceroys, independent of those of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> after the conquest of the latter state by the Argonese. In fact, the customs of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and especially for the nobility, were left unchanged under Spanish rule, which was therefore peaceful, although the conduct of the troops of Diego Veru, returning from Tripoli in 1511, caused a sort of Second <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, soon suppressed, however, by the viceroy Moncada. There was another more serious revolt, contemporaneous with that of Masaniello at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>; it took place in 1647, and was caused by a famine. The new governor, Cardinal Triyulzio, combining severity and clemency, re-established order. From 1713 to 1720 <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> was again separated from the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>, and Vittorio Amedeo of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a> was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> at Palermo. Afterwards, the island followed the fortunes of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, under the Bourbons. In 1798, the royal family was driven by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> to seek refuge in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and again by the French occupation in 1806. The suppression of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> autonomy was the cause of several revolutionary movements at Palermo. In that of 1820-21, a governing commission was created, with Cardinal Gravina at its head; on this occasion peace was re-established with Austrian aid. In 1848 a provisional government was established that offered the crown of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> to Ferdinand of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, who, however, did not accept it. General Filangiere retook Palermo fourteen months later; and finally, Garibaldi overthrew the Bourbon government, and substituted for it, not the autonomy of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, but the annexation of the island to the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>. A last movement in favour of independence was made in 1866, but was quelled in its beginning.

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was preached at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> in Palermo, According to Praedestinatus (I, 6), its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Theodorus, together with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lilybaeum, condemned the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Heracleon, Theodorus being a contemporary of Pope S. Alexander (second decade of the eleventh century); his predecessor, it is said, was St. Philippus. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, St. Mamilianas, who is said to have suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, and whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are preserved in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, may be identical with St. Mamilianus, whom the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> relegated to the island of Monte Cristo in 450. Other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> were Claudius, Sabinus, and Maximus. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Gratianus 503, Victor who died in 603, and Joannes, 603 (<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> was in correspondence with the two last named), Felix, 649, and Theodorus, 787. During the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> domination there appears to have been no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Palermo; it was in that period (828) that SS. Philaretus and Oliva suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. In 1049, <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> sent to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, the Humbertus who, later, became <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal Bishop</a> of Silva Candida; but the Normans, then enemies of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, prevented the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> from landing. In 1065, Bishop Nicodemus was appointed. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were Alcherius (1083); Gualterius (1113), the first to bear the title of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, although the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> had been sent to Joannes (603); Stephanus (1166), compelled by his enemies to resign; Gualtiero Offamiglio (of the Mill), an Englishman, who died in 1191; Bartolomeo (1201), brother of the preceding, who was sent into exile; Gualtiero da Polena, who was appointed in 1201 by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> and transferred to <a href="../cathen/03429a.htm">Catania</a>, Parisius being installed in his stead; Berardo di Castaca (1214-52), a great diplomat and a mediator between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>; Licio de Colle (1296), a benefactor of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; Bartomomeo da Antiochia (1305); Francesco da Antiochia (1311); Giovanni Orsini (1320); Matteo Orsini (1371); Nicolo d' Agrigento, O.

Simone Beccatelli (1445)a generous restorer of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and of other churches; Nicolo Puxades (1466), who caused the stalls of the choir of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> to be adorned with inlaid work; Giovanni Borghi (1467), who had been a famous physician; Filippo (1474), who was a nephew of King Ferdinand, and died under the walls of <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a> in 1488; Cardinal Pietro, Count of Foix, O. Min. (1485); Cardinal Tommaso de Vio, O.P. (Caietanus), who was elected in 1519, but not recognized by <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> not recognizing Giovanni Carandolet, the king's candidate; Ottavianno Preconi, O. Min. (1562), <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the decoration of the churches; Cesare Marulli (1578), who founded the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>; Cardinal Giannetto Doria (1609-42), who was for a time viceroy and reformed the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, and distinguished himself for his charity during the famine of 1624; Mart&iacute;n de Leon y Cardenas (1650), who donated the beautiful tabernacle of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; Pietro Martinez Rubio (1656), who was noted for his charity and obtained the use of the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> for his cannons; Cardinal Domenico Pignatelli (1802); Cardinal Pietro Gravina (1816); Cardinal Gaetano M.
