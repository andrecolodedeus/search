<h1>Palm Sunday</h1>  

<p>The sixth and last Sunday of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> and beginning of <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>, a Sunday of the highest rank, not even a commemoration of any kind being permitted in the Mass. In <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> it fixes the commencement of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. The Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> marks the station at St. John Lateran (see STATIONS) and before September, 1870, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> performed the ceremonies there. The Greeks celebrate the day with great solemnity; they call it <em>kyriake</em> or <em>heorte ton baion</em> or <em>heorte baiophoros</em> or also Lazarus Sunday, because on the day before they have the feast of the resuscitation of Lazarus. The emperors used to distribute branches of palm and small presents among their nobles and domestics. The Latin <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> call it Dominica in Palmis, Dominica or Dies Palmarum. From the cry of the people during the procession the day has received the name Dominica <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> or simply <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> (Ozanna). Because every great feast was in some way a remembrance of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection of Christ</a> and was in consequence called <em>Pascha</em>, we find the names <em>Pascha floridum</em>, in French <em>P&acirc;ques fleuries</em>, in Spanish <em>Pascua florida</em>, and it was from this day of 1512 that our <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">State of Florida</a> received its name (<a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, II, 205). From the custom of also blessing flowers and entwining them among the palms arose the terms <em>Dominica florida</em> and <em>dies floridus</em>. Flower-Sunday was well known in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> as <em>Blumensonntag</em> or <em>Blumentag</em>, as also among the Serbs, Croats, and <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/06575b.htm">Glagolite</a> <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> and <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, and among the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>. The latter celebrate another Palm Sunday on the seventh Sunday after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> to commemorate the "Ingressus Domini in coelum juxta visionem Gregorii Illuminatoris" called <em>Secundus floricultus</em> or <em>Secunda palmarum dominica</em> (<a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, II, 519). Since this Sunday is the beginning of <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>, during which sinners were reconciled, it was called <em>Dominica indulgentioe, competentium</em>, and <em>capitilavium</em> from the practice of washing and shaving of the head as a bodily preparation for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. During the early centuries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> this sacrament was conferred solemnly only in the night of <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>, the text of the creed had been made known to the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> on the preceding Palm Sunday. This practice was followed in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (Isidore, "De off. eccl.", I, 27), in Gaul (P.L., LXXII, 265), and in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (Ambrose, Ep. xx). In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the day was called Olive or <a href="../cathen/02738b.htm">Branch Sunday</a>, Sallow or Willow, Yew or Blossom Sunday, or Sunday of the Willow Boughs. Since the celebration recalled the solemn entry of Christ into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> people made use of many quaint and realistic representations; thus, a figure of Christ seated on an ass, carved out of wood was carried in the procession and even brought into the church. Such figures may still be seen in the museums of Basle, <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and N&uuml;rnberg (Kellner, 50).

<p>In some places in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> it was customary to strew flowers and green boughs about the cross in the churchyard. After the Passion had been recited at Mass blessed palms were brought and this cross (in consequence sometimes called the Palm cross) was wreathed and decked with them to symbolize <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> victory. In Lower <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> boys went about the streets singing the "Pueri Hebr&aelig;orum" and other carols, whence they received the name of Pueribuben ("Theologisch-praktische Quartalschrift", 1892, 81). Sometimes an uncovered crucifix, or the gospel-book, and often the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, was carried in recession. In many parts of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> a large and beautiful tent was prepared in the churchyard. Two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> accompanied by lights brought the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> in a beautiful cup or <a href="../cathen/12588a.htm">pyx</a> hung in a shrine of open work to this tent. A long-drawn procession with palms and flowers came out of the church and made four stations at the Laics' cemetery north of the church, at the south side, at the west door, and before the church-yard cross, which was then uncovered. At each of these stations Gospels were sung. After the singing of the first Gospel the shrine with the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> was borne forward. On meeting, all prostrated and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> the ground. The procession then continued. The door of the church was opened, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> held up on high the shrine with the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, so that all who went in had to go under this shrine, and thus the procession came back into the church. The introduction of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> into the Palm Sunday procession is generally ascribed to Bl. <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> who ordered the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> for his Abbey of Bec.

<p>Liturgical writers differ in assigning a time for the introduction of the benediction of palms and of the procession. Mart&egrave;ne, "De antiq. eccl. discipl." xx, 288, finds no mention of them before, the eighth or ninth century. Peliccia, "Christian. eccl. politia", II, 308, is of the same opinion and mentions Amularius, "De div. off.", I, x, as the first to speak of them. <a href="../cathen/02570c.htm">Binterim</a>, V, i, 173, on the authority of Severus, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and of Josue Stylites, states that Peter <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, about 397 ordered the benediction of the palms for all the churches of Mesopotamia. The ceremonies had their origin most probably in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. In the "Peregrinatio Sylvi&aelig;", undertaken between 378 and 394, they are thus described: On the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Lord's Day</a> which begins the Paschal, or Great, Week, after all the customary exercises from cook-crow till morn had taken place in the Anastasia and at the Cross, they went to the greater church behind the Cross on Golgotha, called the Martyrium, and here the ordinary Sunday services were held. At the seventh hour (one o'clock p. m.) all proceeded to the Mount of Olives, Eleona, the cave in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> used to teach, and for two hours <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, anthems, and lessons were recited. About the hour of None (three o'clock p. m.) all went, singing <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, to the Imbomon, whence <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Our Lord ascended into heaven</a>. Here two hours more were spent in devotional exercises, until about 5 o'clock, when the passage from the Gospel relating how the children carrying branches and Palms met the Lord, saying "Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord" is read. At these words all went back to the city, repeating "Blessed is He that cometh in the Name of the Lord." All the children bore branches of palm or olive. The faithful passed through the city to the Anastasia, and there recited <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>. Then after a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the church of the Holy Cross all returned to their homes.

<p>In the three oldest Roman Sacramentaries no mention is found of either the benediction of the palms or the procession. The earliest notice is in the "Gregorianum" used in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the ninth and tenth centuries. In it is found among the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the day one that pronounces a blessing on the bearers of the palms but not on the palms. The name <em>Dominica in palmis, De passione Domini</em> occurs in the "Gelasianum", but only as a superscription and Probst ("Sacramentarien und Ordines", M&uuml;nster, 1892, 202) is probably correct in suspecting the first part to be an addition, and the <em>De passione Domini</em> the original inscription. It seems certain that the bearing of palms during services was the earlier practice, then came the procession, and later the benediction of the palms.

<p>The principal ceremonies of the day are the benediction of the palms, the procession, the Mass, and during it the singing of the Passion. The blessing of the palms follows a ritual similar to that of Mass. On the altar branches of palms are placed between the candlesticks instead of flowers ordinarily used. The palms to be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> are on a table at the Epistle side or in <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral churches</a> between the throne and the altar. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> performs the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> from the throne, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at the Epistle side of the altar. An antiphon "Hosanna to the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Son of David</a>" is followed by a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. The Epistle is read from <a href="../bible/exo015.htm#vrs27">Exodus 15:27</a>-<a href="../bible/exo016.htm#vrs7">16:7</a>, narrating the murmuring of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Sin, and sighing for the fleshpots of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and gives the promise of the <a href="../cathen/09604a.htm">manna</a> to be sent as food from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. The Gradual contains the prophetic words uttered by the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiphas</a>, "That it was expedient that one man should die for the people"; and another the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Christ in the Garden of Olives that the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> might pass; also his admonition to the disciples to watch and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. The Gospel, taken from St. Matthew, xvi, 1-9, describes the triumphant entry of Christ into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> when the populace cut boughs from the trees and strewed them as He passed, crying, <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Son of David</a>; blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. (In private Masses this Gospel is read at the end of Mass instead of that of St. John.) Then follow an oration, a preface, the Sanctus, and Benedictus.

<p>In the five <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which are then said the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> asks <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the branches of palm or olive, that they may be a protection to all places into which they may be brought, that the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may expel all adversity, <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> and protect all who dwell in them, who have been redeemed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> make reference to the dove bringing back the olive branch to <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">Noah's ark</a> and to the multitude greeting <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>; they say that the branches of palms signify victory over the prince of death and the olive the advent of spiritual unction through Christ. The officiating <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> sprinkles the palms with <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incenses</a> them, and, after another <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, distributes them. During the distribution the choir sings the "Pueri Hebr&aelig;orum". The Hebrew children spread their garments in the way and cried out saying, "Hosanna to the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Son of David</a>; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord." Then follows the procession, of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and of the people, carrying the blessed palms, the choir in the mean time singing the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a> "Cum appropinquaret", "Cum audisset", and others. All march out of the church. On the return of the procession two or four chanters enter the church, close the door and sing the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> "Gloria, laus", which is repeated by those outside. At the end of the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> knocks at the door with the staff of the cross, the door is opened, and all enter singing "Ingrediente Domino". Mass is celebrated, the principal feature of which is the singing of the Passion according to St. Matthew, during which all hold the palms in their hands.

<p>Palm branches have been used by all nations as an emblem of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and victory over enemies; in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> as a sign of victory over the flesh and the world according to <a href="../bible/psa091.htm#vrs13">Psalm 91:13</a>, "Justus ut palma florebit"; hence especially associated with the memory of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. The palms blessed on Palm Sunday were used in the procession of the day, then taken home by the faithful and used as a sacramental. They were preserved in prominent places in the house, in the barns, and in the fields, and thrown into the fire during storms. On the Lower Rhine the custom exists of decorating the grave with blessed palms. From the blessed palms the ashes are procured for <a href="../cathen/01775b.htm">Ash Wednesday</a>. In places where palms cannot be found, branches of olive, box elder, spruce or other trees are used and the "C&aelig;remoniale episcoporum", II, xxi, 2 suggests that in such cases at least little flowers or crosses made of palm be attached to the olive boughs. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> olive branches are distributed to the people, while the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> carry palms frequently dried and twisted into various shapes. In parts of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> large swamp willows, with their catkins, and ornamented with flowers and ribbons, were used.
