<h1>Pandects</h1>  

<p>(PANDECT&AElig;, or DIGESTA)

<p>This part of <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Justinian's</a> compilation was his most important contribution to <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>. The language of d'Aguesseau, applied by him to pre-Napoleonic Continental law, has equal application to the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">Common Law</a> System. The reasons underlying legal institutions are either historical or <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a>; and every <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> rule of law is capable of illumination from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Pandects. There is no other standard of comparative <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>. D'Aguesseau pithily observes: "Justice has fully unveiled her mysteries only to the Roman jurists. They are the safest interpreters of our own <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>: they lend their spirit to our usages, their reason to our customs; and, by the principles they give us, serve as our guides even when we walk in paths that were unknown to them." Of the Pandects, Prost de Royer says: "It is an immense edifice, without distribution, without proportion, without ensemble. The pediments have disappeared, the columns are broken, the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> are mutilated: it is no longer imposing by its grandeur, by the beauty of its parts, by the richness of its details. After so many centuries, the digging goes on, as our artists still go to seek rules and models among the ruins of <a href="../cathen/11433a.htm">Palmyra</a>, of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> and of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>."

<p>Hastily compiled by Tribonian and his associates (in a scant three years) from the writings of thirty-nine eminent jurisconsults, the Pandects leave much to be desired in arrangement and abound in repetitions and antinomies. The arrangement, which follows that of the Perpetual Edict, is historical or traditional, rather than scientific. The adjective, or remedial, element dominates the classification. Although more <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> were actually defined or capable of definition in the Roman legal system than is even now possible in the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">Common Law</a> System, no classification based upon <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> was evolved. The thing classified was an actual system of law, and the only principles of arrangement were those of tradition and convenience. Neither the jurists nor the compilers were concerned with theoretical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a>. The materials of the Digest were not written into a continuous text. The fragments give the name of the jurist and the book from which they are taken. This method was designed to perpetuate the fame of the jurists and we thus enjoy a certain familiarity with them, although their writings for the greater part have perished. There are four hundred and thirty-two "titles" contained in the fifty books of the Digest. The whole is divided into seven parts: the first, called <em>prota</em>, has four books (I-IV); the second, "De judiciis", seven books (V-XI); the third, "De rebus", eight books (XII-XIX); the fourth, "Umbilicus", eight books (XX-XXVII); the fifth, "De testamentis", nine books (XXVIII-XXXVI); the sixth, with a great variety of matters, eight books (XXXVII-XLIV); the seventh part, six books (XLV-L). The sixth and seventh parts seem to have had no special designation. This division into seven parts was never of practical importance.

<p>The later, or occidental, arbitrary division adopted by the glossators during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was probably due to the order of time in which the materials became available for the production of a complete vulgate text. The division was as follows: "Digestum vetus" (bk. I-XXIV, tit. 2); the "Infortiatum" (bk. XXIV, tit. 3, &mdash; XXXV, tit. 2, &sect;82); the "Tres partes" (bk. XXXV, tit. 2, &sect;83 &mdash; XXXVIII); the "Digestum novum" (bk. XXXIX-L). The vulgate Manuscripts are in three <em>volumina</em> (the "Infortiatum" with the "Tres partes"). The first printed editions follow this valueless division, and it was abandoned only in the seventeenth century. The celebrated fragment from Gaius (a facsimile of which, as it appears in the Florentine Manuscript, is shown in the accompanying illustration): "Omne jus quo utimur pertinet vel ad personas vel ad res vel ad actiones" (Every right which we enjoy concerns either <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, or things or actions) is not an <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> division of law, was not so regarded by Gaius himself, and was given no importance as a canon of classification by the compilers of the Digest.
<h2>The Florentine manuscript</h2>

<p>The rediscovery of the Pisan, or Florentine, Manuscript of the Pandects has been regarded as the critical secular event for modern civilization by those who associate the revival of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> with the legend of <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a>. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, who destroyed the Lombard monarchy (c. 800), was unable to find a copy of the works of Justinian. <a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">Yves de Chartres</a>, three centuries later, mentions fragments, and shortly after his death the legendary narrative begins. Pothier accepts it and relates the circumstances in which the "complete copy of the Pandects emerged from the shadows of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> as by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>". During the siege of <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a> (about 1136 or 1137), the Emperor Lothair II, sustaining the cause of <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> against Roger, Count of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, champion of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/01447a.htm">Pietro Pierleone</a>, recovered the priceless Manuscript and gave it to the <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a> as a reward for their great service in furnishing him a fleet. A Pisan historian claims to have seen the original deed of gift. The Manuscript was long treasured at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, but at last fell into the hands of the victorious Florentines, who carried it away in triumph in the early fifteenth century. It was preserved with great veneration in the ducal palace at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, as an original written in the time of Justinian and by him sent to <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a>. About the time of the fabled finding at <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a>, a copy of the Code and a second copy of the Pandects were unearthed at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>.

<p>The sacking of <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a> (according to the tradition) led to the founding, by <a href="../cathen/08168a.htm">Irnerius</a> of the first and most famous <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, that of Bologna, and was the beginning of the revival. Sigonius gave his authority to the story, and it was generally credited until 1726, when Grandi, a Pisan professor, seriously questioned it. The revival of the study of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> was well under way at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and at Bologna long before the alleged sacking of <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a> and the immediate <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/08168a.htm">Irnerius</a> had reached its zenith before the year 1118. It is an established fact that there was a very ancient Manuscript at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, that this Manuscript was brought to Florence in 1406 or 1411, and that it is still in existence. It is however a copy, not an original, and probably dates from about one hundred years after Justinian. Odofredus (died 1265) says it was brought to <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> from Constantinople; according to Bartolus (died 1357), it had always been at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. That it ever was at <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a> is improbable, and the legend is supported only by Pisan chronicles. Laferri&egrave;re maintains that the story is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Savigny and Ortolan reject it. Ortolan argues that if <a href="../cathen/08168a.htm">Irnerius</a> and the early glossators became acquainted with it only as the result of the sacking of <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a>, they would not have passed over so momentous an event in silence.
<h2>The Vulgate</h2>

<p>By comparison of earlier <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">Manuscripts</a> then extant with each other and with the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">Manuscript</a> at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, the glossators reconstructed the generally received text of Bologna, known as the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a>.
<h2>Pandekten</h2>

<p>In the sixteenth century the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> was received in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and became the positive <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the Pandekten in the special sense is <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, as a body of actual law, modern <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> "modified by the Canon law, the customary law of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and by the statute of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>". The Pandekten, as part of the legal curriculum, give the altered <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>. The pure private law of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> of the sixth century, is generally designated Institutionen. The Pandekten, in the special sense, since the adoption of the new German Civil Code, are no longer of legal efficacy in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>.
