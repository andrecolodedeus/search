<h1>Pandulph</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11121a.htm">Norwich</a>, died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 16 Sept., 1226. He is commonly but <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> called Cardinal Pandulph, owing to his being confused with Cardinal Pandulph Masca of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> (created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, 1182; died 1201). The identification involves the supposition that the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> lived more than a hundred years after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> as <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>. A Roman by birth, Pandulph first came into notice as a clerk in the court of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, where he was one of the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> attached to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> household. In 1211 <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent</a> sent him to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to induce the king to receive Langton as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and thus to relieve <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> which weighed so heavily on all classes. His interview with the king at <a href="../cathen/11107b.htm">Northampton</a> elicited only threats from the king to hang the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> if he landed in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Pandulph joined Langton and the exiled <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> and then returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The whole account of this mission is rejected by some writers as resting solely on the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalist</a> of Burton; but his account, confirmed by allusions in <a href="../cathen/11499a.htm">Matthew Paris</a> and other writers, may be accepted as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. In 1213 Pandulph was again sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal envoy</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, as the king seemed prepared to submit, and on 15 May took place in Dover Castle the historic interview at which King John surrendered his crown into Pandulph's hands and received it back as a fief of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The king also paid to Pandulph the sum of &pound;8000 as an instalment of the compensation due for damage done to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> during the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, the sum being delivered to the exiled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Pandulph now stopped the threatened French invasion. When the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, Cardinal Nicholas of Tusculum, arrived in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, Pandulph naturally fell into a secondary position, but he continued active, collecting money to compensate sufferers from the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> and mediating between the king and the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a>. In 1214 he was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to counter-check the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were appealing against the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>; in this he failed, for the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> was recalled, and Pandulph again returned to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> where he remained through the struggle for Magna Charta, in which his name occurs as one of those by whose counsel the Charter was granted. The king, anxious to retain his support, procured his election as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11121a.htm">Norwich</a>, though he did not yet receive <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. When <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent's</a> <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> arrived annulling Magna Charta, Pandulph <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the barons who would not receive it, and suspended Langton himself on his setting out to appeal to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in person. Again superseded by the advent of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, Pandulph, on the death of John, apparently returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where he held the positions of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> notary and chamberlain. On 12 Sept., 1218, he was sent to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>. As Henry III was a minor and the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> who governed after the death of the regent Pembroke were disunited, the position of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> as representing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who was now suzerain of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, was very powerful. From 1219 to 1221 Pandulph practically acted as ruler of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. His administration was successful; the revenue was increased, the country prosperous, truces were made with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, Jewish <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usurers</a> suppressed, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> was firmly administered. But he encountered the opposition of Cardinal Langton who considered the exercise of legatine power prejudicial to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and of Hubert de Burgh, who opposed the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate's</a> action in the government of Poitou. During a visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Langton procured the withdrawal of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> and on 19 July, 1221, Pandulph publicly resigned his function as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a>. He had hitherto at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> desire postponed his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11121a.htm">Norwich</a> to avoid coming under the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, but, as this reason now no longer held good, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself on his return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (29 May, 1222). He spent the rest of his life there engaged in diplomatic affairs, but after his death his body was brought back to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and buried in Norwich <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.
