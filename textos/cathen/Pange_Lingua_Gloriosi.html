<h1>Pange Lingua Gloriosi</h1>  

<p>The opening words of two <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> celebrating respectively the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. The former, in unrhymed verse, is generally credited to <a href="../cathen/06149a.htm">St. Venantius Fortunatus</a> (6 cent.), and the latter, in rhymed accentual rhythm, was composed by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> (13 cent.).
<h2 id="section1">The Hymn of Fortunatus</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> has been ascribed to Claudianus Mamertus (5 cent.) by Gerbert in his "Musica sacra", B&#228;hr in his "Die christl. Dichter," and many others. Pimont, who cites many other authorities in his support, is especially urgent in his ascription of the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> to Mamertus, answers at great length the critics of the ascription in his Note sur l'auteur du Pange &hellip; pr&oelig;lium certaminis (Hymnes du br&eacute;v. rom. III, 70-76), so that it seems hardly correct to say with Mearns (Dict. of Hymnol. 2nd ed., 880), that "it has been sometimes, apparently without reason, ascribed to Claudianus Mamertus." Excluding the closing stanza or <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> comprises ten stanzas, which appear in the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and in some editions of the "Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>" in the form:<br> <blockquote>Pange lingua gloriosi pr&oelig;lium certaminis<br> Et super crucis trop&aelig;o dic triumphum nobilem,<br> Qualiter Redemptor orbis immolatus vicerit.</blockquote><br> The stanza is thus seen to comprise three tetrameter trochaic catalectic verses. In the "Roman <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>" the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> is assigned to <a href="../cathen/11535a.htm">Passion Sunday</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferial</a> Offices following it down to and including Wednesday in <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>, and also to the feasts of the Finding of the Holy Cross, the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, the Crown of Thorns, the <a href="../cathen/15714a.htm">Five Wounds</a>. In this breviary use, the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> is divided into two, the first five stanzas being said at <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>, the second five (beginning with the words "Lustra sex qui jam peregit") at <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>; and each line is divided into two, forming a stanza of six lines, e.g.: <blockquote>Pange lingua gloriosi<br> Lauream certaminis,<br> Et super crucis troph&aelig;o<br> Dic triumphum nobilem:<br> Qualiter Redemptor orbis<br> Immolatus vicerit.</blockquote><br> The whole <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> is sung during the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of the Adoration of the Cross on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, immediately after the <em>Improperia</em> or "Reproaches", but in a peculiar manner, the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> being preceded by the eighth stanza (<em>Crux fidelis</em>) while the stanzas are followed alternately by the first four and the last two lines of the (divided) eighth stanza.

<p>It will have been noticed that in the six-lined stanza quoted above, "lauream" has not commended itself to <a href="../cathen/07596a.htm">hymnologists</a>, who declare that no pleonasm is involved, since "pr&oelig;lium" refers to the battle and "certamen" to the occasion or cause of it; so that "pr&oelig;lium certaminis" means the battle for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men (see Kayser, "Beitr&#228;ge zur Gesch. und Erkl&#228;rung der &#228;ltesten Kirchenhym.", <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, 1881, p. 417). He very aptly instances <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (ep. ad Ant., 4): "Pr&aelig;lium gloriosi certaminis in persecutione ferveret", and adds that "certamen" reveals the importance and length of the strife and renders salient the master thought of the whole poem. In the hands of the correctors the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> suffered many emendations in the interest of classical exactness of phrase and metre. The corrected form is that found today in the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a>. The older form, with various <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> readings, will be found in March (Latin Hymns, 64; with grammatical and other notes, 252), Pimont (Les Hymnes etc., III, 47-70, with a note on the authorship, 70-76), etc. The Commission on Plain Chant established by order of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> in many cases restored older forms of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> texts. In the Gradual (the Antiphonary has not appeared as yet) the older form of the "Pange lingua" is now given, so that it can be compared with the form still used in our <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>. For the variant readings of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> see "Analecta Hymnica" (Leipzig, 1907), 71-73. Dreves ascribes the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> to <a href="../cathen/06149a.htm">Fortunatus</a>. See also the "Hymnarium Sarisburiense" (London, 1851), 84.

<p>It will be of interest to give here some specimens of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> translations of some stanzas of the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>.<br> <blockquote><center>i</center><br> Sing loud the conflict, O my tongue,<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;The victory that repaired our loss;<br> Exalt the triumph of thy song<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;To the bright trophy of the cross;<br> Tell how the Lord laid down his life<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;To conquer in the glorious strife.<br> <center>(J.

P.)</center><br> <center>ii</center><br> Eating of the Tree forbidden,<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;Man had sunk in <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan's</a> snare,<br> When his pitying Creator<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;Did this second Tree prepare;<br> Destined, many ages later,<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;That first <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to repair.<br> <center>(<a href="../cathen/03417a.htm">Father Caswall</a>.)</center><br> <center>v</center><br> Thus <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made Man an Infant lies,<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;And in the manger weeping cries;<br> His sacred limbs by Mary bound,<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;The poorest tattered rags surround;<br> And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> incarnate feet and hands<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;Are closely bound with swathing-bands.<br> <center>(<a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, 1763.)</center><br> <center>vi</center><br> Soon the sweetest blossom wasting,<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;Droops its head and withered lies;<br> Early thus to Calvary hasting,<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;On the cross the Saviour dies;<br> Freely death for all men tasting,<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;There behold our sacrifice.<br> <center>(R.

Eccl. Rev., 1891.)</center> </blockquote><br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The selected stanzas do not exhaust the examples of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> versions, but offer some variety in metre and in rhyming schemes. They represent neither the best nor the worst work of their authors in the translations of this <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>. In the preface to his "annus Sanctus" Orby Shipley declared that "the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> for their <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> is no recent &hellip; fancy &hellip; and that the results achieved are not less wide in extent, not less worthy in merit than attempts of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> translators, facts overlooked even by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> translators." His thought is worthy of much consideration in view of the fact that the English version in the <a href="../cathen/03089b.htm">Marquess of Bute's</a> translation of the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> (I, 409), in the (Baltimore) "Manual of Prayers" (614), and Tozer's "Catholic Church Hymnal" (p. 48), was the work of an <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a>, Dr. Neale.



<p>It may well be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> if any translator has expressed better in English verse the strength and nobility of the original Latin than did the unknown <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> author of the version found in the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> of 1763 (given in stanza v above). Daniel gives the following stanza (Thes. Hymnol., I, 168): <blockquote>Quando judex orbis alto vectus ave veneris,<br> Et crucis tu&aelig; trop&aelig;um inter astra fulserit,<br> O sis anxius asylum et salutis aurora.</blockquote>

<p>which Neale translates (Medieval Hymns, 3rd ed., p. 5) and thinks ancient though not original; but Daniel's source is the "Corolla Hymnorum" (Cologne, 1806). The text reads "salutis anchora". Daniel also gives (IV, 68) four stanzas which <a href="../cathen/10478b.htm">Mone</a> thought might be of the seventh century; but they would add nothing to the beauty or neat perfection of the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>. For first lines, authors, dates of translation, etc., see Julian, "Dict. of Hymnol.", 880- 881, 1685. For Latin text and translation with comment, see "Amer. Eccles. Review", March, 1891, 187-194, and "H. A. and M., Historical Edition" (London, 1909, No. 107).
<h2 id="section2">The Hymn of St. Thomas Aquinas</h2>

<p>Composed by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> (see <a href="../cathen/09036b.htm">L<font size=-2 >AUDA</font> S<font size=-2>ION</font></a>) for the Office of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> (see <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">C<font size=-2>ORPUS</font> C<font size=-2>HRISTI,</font> F<font size=-2 >EAST OF</font></a>). Including the last stanza (which borrows the words "Genitori Genitoque"&mdash;Procedenti ab utroque, Compar" from the first two strophes of the second sequence of <a href="../cathen/01134b.htm">Adam of St. Victor</a> for Pentecost) the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> comprises six stanzas appearing in the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> <blockquote>Pange, lingua, gloriosi corporis mysterium,<br> Sanguinisque pretiosi quem in mundi pretium<br> Fructus ventris generosi Rex effudit gentium.</blockquote>

<p>Written in accentual rhythm, it imitates the triumphant march of the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> of <a href="../cathen/06149a.htm">Fortunatus</a>, and like it is divided in the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> into stanzas of six lines whose alternating triple rhyming is declared by Pimont to be a new feature in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> hymnody. In the <a href="../cathen/16013a.htm">Roman Breviary</a> the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> is assigned to both <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>, but of old the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13401a.htm">Salisbury</a> placed it in <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>, that of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> in First <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> only, that of Saint-Germain- des-Pr&eacute;s at Second <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> only, and that of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> at <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a>. It is sung in the procession to the repository on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Holy Thursday</a> and also in the procession of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> and in that of the Forty Hours' Adoration.

<p>With respect to the metre, M. de Marcellus, quoted in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne's</a> "Litt&eacute;rature", remarks that the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> is composed in the long trochaic verses such as are found in Catullus, Seneca, Sophocles, and Euripides. In addition to the felicitous rhythm chosen by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, critics recognize its poetical and hymnodal values (thus Neale: "This <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> contests the second place among those of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> with the Vexilla Regis, the Stabat Mater, the Jesu dulcis memoria, the Ad Regias Agni Dapes, the Ad Supernam, and one or two others &hellip;") and "its peculiar qualities, its <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> neatness, dogmatic precision, and force of almost argumentative statement" (Duffield, "Latin Hymns", 269), in which qualities "it excels all these mentioned" by Neale.

<p>The translations have not been many nor felicitous. <em>Generosi</em> in the first stanza is not "generous" (as in Neale's version) but "noble" (as in <a href="../cathen/03417a.htm">Caswall's</a>). But, as Neale truly says, "the great crux of the translator is the fourth verse" (i.e., "Verbum caro panem verum, etc."), so full is it of verbal and real antitheses. To illustrate the question of translation we select from the specimen versions the fourth stanza, since its very peculiar condensation of thought and phrase, dogmatic precision and illuminating antitheses, have made it "a bow of Ulysses to translators". Its text is: <blockquote>Verbum caro panem verum<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Verbo carnem efficit;<br> Fitque sanguis Christi merum;<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Et si sensus deficit,<br> Ad firmandum cor sincerum<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sola fides sufficit.</blockquote>

<p>A literal translation would be: "The Word-(made)-Flesh makes by (His) word <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> bread into flesh; and wine becomes <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood; and if the (unassisted) <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> fails (to recognize all this), <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone suffices to assure the pure heart". <em>Sensus</em> (singular) is taken here to indicate the inner sense, as distinguished from <em>sensuum</em> (plural) of the following stanza, where the word directly refers to the external senses. Perhaps the word has the same implication in both stanzas. "Sincere" (in its modern meaning) may be a better word than "pure". Taking first the old versions found in books of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> devotion, we find in the "Primer" of 1604: <blockquote>The word now being flesh become,<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So very bread flesh by the word,<br> And wine the blood of Christ is made,<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though our sense it not afford,<br> But this in heart sincere to fix<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Faith sufficeth to accord.</blockquote>

<p>It is not in the rhythm of the Latin, and contains but three monosyllabic rhymes instead of the six double rhymes of the Latin. The "Primer" of 1619 makes an advance to six monosyllabic rhymes; and the "Primer" of 1685 arranges the rhymes in couplets. The "Primer" of 1706 retains the rhythm and the rhymic scheme, but is somewhat more flowing and less heavy: <blockquote>The Word made flesh for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of man,<br> With words of bread made flesh again;<br> Turned wine to blood unseen of sense,<br> By virtue of <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a>;<br> And here the faithful rest secure,<br> Whilst <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can vouch and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ensure.</blockquote>

<p>A distinct advance in rhythmic and rhymic correspondence was made in more recent times by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers like Wackerbarth, <a href="../cathen/03417a.htm">Father Caswall</a>, and Judge D.J. Donahoe. <blockquote>At the incarnate Word's high bidding<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bread to very flesh doth turn.<br> Wine becometh <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> blood-shedding<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And if sense cannot discern,<br> Guileless spirits never dreading<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;May from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> sufficient learn.<br> <center>(Wackerbarth, 1842)</center><br> Word made flesh, the bread of nature<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By his word to flesh he turns;<br> Wine into his blood he changes:&mdash;<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What though sense no change discerns?<br> Only be the heart in earnest,<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Faith her lesson quickly learns.<br> <center>(<a href="../cathen/03417a.htm">Caswall</a>, 1849)</center></blockquote>

<p>Neale criticizes the version of Wackerbarth: "Here the antithesis is utterly lost, by the substitution of Incarnate for made flesh, and bidding for word, to say nothing of Blood-shedding for Blood"; and declares that <a href="../cathen/03417a.htm">Caswall</a> "has given, as from his freedom on rhyme might be expected, the best version". He remarks, however, that <a href="../cathen/03417a.htm">Caswall</a> has not given the "panem verum" of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>. <blockquote>By his word the bread he breaketh<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To his very flesh he turns;<br> In the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> which he taketh,<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Man the cleansing blood discerns.&ndash;<br> Faith to loving bosoms maketh<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Clear the mystic <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> she learns.<br> <center>(D. J. Donahoe, 1908)</center></blockquote>

<p>Some of the more recent translations take little account of the nice discriminations of antithesis pointed out by Dr. Neale, who when he attempted in his day a new version, modestly wrote that it "claims no other merit than an attempt to unite the best portions of the four best translations with which I am acquainted&mdash;Mr. Wackerbarth's, <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Dr. Pusey's</a>, that of the Leeds book, and <a href="../cathen/03417a.htm">Mr. Caswall's</a>". His version is: <blockquote>Word made Flesh, by Word He maketh<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;very bread his flesh to be;<br> Man in wine <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Blood partaketh,<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And if senses fail to see,<br> Faith alone the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heart waketh<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To behold the mystery.</blockquote>

<p>The present writer rendered the stanza in the "Amer. Eccles. Review" (March, 1890), 208, as follows: <blockquote>Into Flesh the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> bread turneth<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By His word, the Word made Flesh;<br> Wine to Blood: while sense discerneth<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nought beyond the sense's mesh,<br> Faith an awful mystery learneth,<br> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And must teach the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> afresh.</blockquote>

<p>Neale's version is given in the <a href="../cathen/03089b.htm">Marquess of Bute's</a> "Roman <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>". The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> hymnal, "Hymns Ancient and Modern", declares its version "based on tr. from Latin by <a href="../cathen/03417a.htm">E. Caswall</a>"; but, as Julian points out, most of it is based on Neale, four of whose stanzas it rewrites, while a fifth is rewritten from <a href="../cathen/03417a.htm">Caswall</a> (i.e. the third stanza), and the fourth stanza is by the compilers. The arrangement found in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> hymnal is taken bodily into the (Baltimore) "Manual of Prayers"&mdash;a rather infelicitous procedure, as the fourth stanza is not faithful to the original (Neale, "Medieval Hymns and Sequences," 181). The last stanza and the <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a> form a special <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> (see <a href="../cathen/14445b.htm">T<font size=-2 >ANTUM</font> E<font size=-2>RGO</font></a>) prescribed for Benediction of the Most <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. The Vatican edition of the Graduale gives its plain-song melody in two forms, both of great beauty.
