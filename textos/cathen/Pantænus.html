<h1>Pant&aelig;nus</h1>  

<p>Head of the Catechetical School of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> about 180 (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.10</a>), still alive in 193 (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, "Chron." Abr., 2210). As he was succeeded by Clement who left Alexandria about 203, the probable <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death would be about 200. He was trained in the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> philosophy; as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missionary, he reached <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> (probably South Arabia), and found there <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> possessing the Gospel of St. Matthew in Hebrew, which they had received from St. Bartholomew. All this is given by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> as what was "said" (<a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.11</a>). <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> continues: "In his 'Hypotyposes' he [Clement] speaks of Pant&aelig;nus by name as his teacher. It seems to me that he alludes to the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> also in his <a href="../fathers/0210.htm">'Stromata'</a>." In the passage of the "Stromata" (<a href="../fathers/02101.htm">I.1</a>), which <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> proceeds to quote, Clement enumerates his principal teachers, giving their nationality but not their names. The last, with whom <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> would identify Pant&aelig;nus, was "a Hebrew of Palestine, greater than all the others [in ability], whom having hunted out in his concealment in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, I found rest." These teachers "preserving the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> tradition of the blessed <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> from the Holy Apostles Peter and James, John and Paul . . . came, by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will, even to us" etc. Against <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius's</a> conjecture it may be suggested that a Hebrew of Palestine was not likely to be trained in <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> philosophy. In its favour are the facts that the teacher was met in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and that Pant&aelig;nus endeavoured to press the Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> into the service of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. It may well be that a mind like Clement's "found rest" in this feature of his teaching.

<p><a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (VI, xiii) says again that Clement in his "Hypotyposes" mentioned Pant&aelig;nus, and further adds that he gave "his opinions and traditions". The inference commonly drawn from this statement is that, in the extant fragments of the "Hypotyposes" where he quotes "the elders", Clement had Pant&aelig;nus in mind; and one opinion or tradition in particular, assigned to "the blessed elder" (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.14</a>), is unhesitatingly ascribed to Pant&aelig;nus. But this is incautious, for we cannot be sure that Clement would have reckoned Pant&aelig;nus among the elders; and if he did so, there were other elders whom he had known (<a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.13</a>). <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, defending his use of Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, appeals to the example of Pant&aelig;nus, "who benefited many before our time by his thorough preparation in such things" (<a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.19</a>). That Pant&aelig;nus anticipated Clement and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> in the study of Greek philosophy, as an aid to <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, is the most important fact we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> concerning him. Photius (cod. 118) states, in his account of the "Apology for <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>" by <a href="../cathen/11436b.htm">Pamphilus</a> and <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (see SAINT PAMPHILUS OF C&AElig;SAREA), that they said Pant&aelig;nus had been a hearer of men who had seen the Apostles, nay, even had heard them himself. The second statement may have been a conjecture based upon the identification of Pant&aelig;nus with one of the teachers described in <a href="../fathers/02101.htm"><em>Stromata</em> I.1</a>, and a too literal interpretation of what is said about these teachers deriving their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> direct from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. The first statement may well have been made by Clement; it explains why he should mention Pant&aelig;nus in his "Hypotyposes", a book apparently made up of traditions received from the elders. Pant&aelig;nus is quoted; <ul><li>(a) in the "Eclog&aelig; ex Prophetis" (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, "Clem. Alex.", II, 723) and <li>(b) in the "Scholia in Greg. Theolog." of <a href="../cathen/10078b.htm">St. Maximus Confessor</a>.</ul>

<p>But these quotations may have been taken from the "Hypotyposes". The last named in his prologue to "Dionys. Areop." (ed. Corder, p. 36) speaks casually of his writings, but he merely seems to assume he must have written. A conjecture has been hazarded by Lightfoot (Apost. Fathers, 488), and followed up by Batiffol ("L'glise naissante", 3rd ed., 213 sqq.), that Pant&aelig;nus was the writer of the concluding chapters of the <a href="../cathen/05008b.htm">"Epistle to Diognetus"</a>. The chief, though not the only ground for this suggestion, is that Anastasius Sinaita in two passages (ed. <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, pp. 860, 892) singles out Pant&aelig;nus with two or three other early Fathers as interpreting the six days of Creation and the <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Garden of Eden</a> as figuring <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> &mdash; a line of thought pursued in the fragment.
