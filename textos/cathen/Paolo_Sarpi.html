<h1>Paolo Sarpi</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a> and anti-papal historian and statesman, b. at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 14 August, 1552; d. there 14 or 15 January, 1623. At the age of 13 he joined the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a> Order, exchanging his <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">baptismal name</a> of Pietro for that of Paolo. He was appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and canon law when he was only twenty. After four years he spent a short time at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and then taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> in his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. Having been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in 1574, he was elected <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of his order for the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> Republic in 1579, and held the office of <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> general, with residence in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, from 1585 to 1588. Returning to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> he devoted himself chiefly to literary pursuits, and about this time his anti-ecclesiastical tendencies became manifest. His intimacy with <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and statesmen hostile to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> caused on various occasions complaints to be lodged against him before the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> Inquisitor. His <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was further increased when on three different occasions the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> rejected his <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> for an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Republic of Venice</a>. The three sees to which <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> had nominated him were Milopotamo in 1593, Caorle in 1600, and Nona in <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> in 1601. The more he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the more acceptable he was to Doge Leonardo Donato and the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> senate, which by a special <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> guaranteed him protection against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and appointed him <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> consultor of the state with an annual salary of two hundred ducats. In this capacity he effected the enactment of various anti-ecclesiastical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and it was chiefly due to the influence of "the terrible friar" that the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> which <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> placed upon <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> (1606) remained without effect and was revoked (21 April, 1607). A murderous assault made upon him on 5 October, 1607, is often ascribed to his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> enemies, but there is not sufficient testimony for their complicity (see the authentic testimony of the witnesses, edited by Bazzoni in "Archivio Storico Italiano", third series, XII, I, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1870, 8 sq.). When peace had been restored between <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Sarpi's political influence grew less, and during the remainder of his life he gave vent to his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by publishing bitter invectives against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Despite his desire to subvert the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion and make <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> republic, he <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocritically</a> performed the ordinary offices of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> until his death. His best known work is a history of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, "Istoria del Concilio Tridentino" (London, 1619) published under the pseudonym of Pietro Soave Polano by the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> Marcantonio de Dominis, with additions by the latter. Without these additions it was published at <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, 1629, and was translated into Latin and some modern languages. It is a bitter invective against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, and even <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, like Ranke, consider it devoid of all authority. For the refutation of this work by Pallavicino see <a href="../cathen/11426a.htm">PIETRO SFORZA PALLAVICINO</a>. His works were published in six volumes (Helmstadt, 1761-5) and two supplementary volumes (Verona, 1768). His letters are: "Lettere Italiane di Fra Sarpi" (Geneva, 1673); Scelte lettere inedite de P. Sarpi", edited by Bianchi-Giovini (Capolago, 1833); "Lettere raccolte di Sarpi", edited by Polidori (Florence, 1863); "Lettere inedite di Sarpi a S. Contarini", edited by Castellani (Venice, 1892); important new letters (1608-16) edited by Benrath (Leipzig, 1909).
