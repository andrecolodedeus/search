<h1>Paolo Segneri, the Elder</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, preacher, missionary, <a href="../cathen/14613a.htm">ascetical</a> writer, b. at Nettuno, 21 March (cf. Massei) 1624; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 9 Dec., 1694. He studied at the Roman College, and in 1637 entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, not without opposition from his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. The eloquent Oliva was his first master in the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>; Sforza Pallacicini taught him <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. Under such guides his virtues and talents developed to maturity. He lectured on humanities for several years, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1653. By a careful study of Scripture, the Fathers, and the Orations of Cicero, he had prepared himself for the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, for which he had ever felt a strong attraction. He volunteered for the foreign missions, but <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, and the chief cities of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> were to be the scene of his labours. He preached at first in the great <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a>, and then for twenty-seven years (1665-92) gave popular missions with an eloquence surpassed only by his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. His "Quaresimale" (Florence, 1679, tr. New York, 1874) had been read and admired by Antonio Pignatelli, who as <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Pope Innocent XII</a> summoned the missionary to preach before him, and made him <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of the <em>Penitentiaria</em>. Segneri's biographer, Massei, states distinctly that "Le Prediche dette nei palazzo apostolico" (Rome, 1694) won the admiration of the pontiff and his Court.

<p>After St. Bernadine of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> and Savanarola, Segneri was <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy's</a> greatest orator. He reformed the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>. Marini and the Marianisti with the petty tricks and simpering <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> of the "Seicento" had degraded the national literature. The <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> even was infected. Segneri at times stumbles into the defects of the "Seicentisti", but his occasional bad taste and abuse of profane erudition cannot blind the impartial critic to his merits. The "Quaresimale", "the Prediche", the "Panegyrici Sacri" (Florence, 1684, translated by Father Humphrey, London, 1877), stamp him as a great orator. His qualities are a vigour of reasoning, a strategist's marshaling of converging <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> and arguments, which recall <a href="../cathen/02717a.htm">Bourdaloue</a>; a richness of <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> which the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> does not possess; a deep and melting pathos. He is particularly cogent in refutation; to harmony of thought and plan, he unites a Dorian harmony of phrase; he is full of unction, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a>, and popular. He has two sources of inspiration, his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the people before him. To his oratorical powers, he added the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of an apostle and the austerities of a great penitent. All this readily explains his wonderful success with people naturally emotional and deeply <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Entire districts flocked to hear him; extraordinary <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> and favours marked his career. His triumphs left him simple as a child. In his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> discussion with his superior-general, Thyrsus Gonzalez, who was a firm champion of Probabiliorism, he combined the respect and obedience of the subject with the reasonable and manly independence of the trained thinker (cf. Lettere sulla Materia del Probabile" in vol. IV of "Opere", Venice, 1748). Segneri wrote also "Il penitente istruito (Bologna, 1669); "Il confessore istruito" (Brescia, 1672); "La Manna dell anima" (Milan, 1683, tr. London, New York, 1892); "Il Cristiano istruito" (Florence, 1690). His complete works (cf. Somervogel) have been frequently edited: at <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, 1701; Venice, 1712-58; Turin, 1855, etc. The "Quaresimale" has been printed at least thirty times. Some of Segneri's works have been translated into Arabic. Hallam criticizes Segneri unfairly; Ford is more just in his appreciation.
