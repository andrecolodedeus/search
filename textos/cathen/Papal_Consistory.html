<h1>Papal Consistory</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Definition</h2>

<p>During the Roman imperial epoch the term <em>consistorium</em> (<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>con-sistere</em>, to stand together) was used to designate the sacred council of the emperors. In time it came to designate the senate of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>, that is, "the assemblage of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinals</a> in council around the Pope" (<a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/11121a.htm">Norwich</a>, in 1212; see Gonzalez, "Commentaria in textus decretalium Gregorii IX", III, vii, 108).
<h2 id="section2">Origin and historical development</h2>

<p>The origin of the papal consistory is closely connected with the history of the Roman presbytery or body of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In the old Roman presbyterium there were <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, in charge of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> temporalities in the various regions of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, at the head of the principal churches of the city, called <em>tituli</em>; and (at least by the eighth century) the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the neighborhood of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of today (divided likewise into the three orders of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>) have succeeded the members of the ancient presbytery not only in the offices attaching to these three grades, though with somewhat different functions, but also, and chiefly, in the capacity of assisting the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the management of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs.

<p>From the earliest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> times the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> were wont to confer with the Roman presbytery on matters affecting the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. From a letter of <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Pope Cornelius</a> (254-255) to <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> we learn that he had summoned his presbytery before agreeing to the reconciliation of three schismatics. Likewise, <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Pope Liberius</a> (352-363) informed the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> about the course of action he had deemed advisable to take during his exile. <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">Pope Siricius</a> (384-398) condemned the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/08530a.htm">Jovinian</a> after having convoked his presbytery. How far the more prominent members of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, eventually called <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, were being gradually entrusted with the management of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs is shown by the action of <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a> in the ninth century. The former ordered that the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Roman cardinals</a> should meet twice a week in the Sacred Palace to provide for the administration of the churches, look after the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and decide the cases of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. The latter ordered them to meet at least twice a month in order to take cognizance of and decide cases of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> brought before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> tribunal. For many centuries, however, the Roman presbytery did not form the senate of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> to the exclusion of all other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, at least in matters of greater importance. These matters were discussed and decided in the Roman council, which, though admitting the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to an active part, consisted chiefly of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> summoned by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> from the greater part of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, as well as of other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who happened to be in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the time. These councils were very frequent until the beginning of the twelfth century. Thenceforth, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> held them more rarely finding it difficult to convoke them as often as the ever increasing volume of business demanded. In their stead the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> transacted the affairs brought before their court in the presence and with the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Roman cardinals</a>, who about the same time had grown in dignity and importance, owing to the fact that the right of electing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> now rested in them exclusively. Thus the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College of Cardinals</a>, assembled in consistory, became the chief organ of the supreme and universal government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>At first, matters of judicial as well as of administrative character were referred to the consistory. In course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, however, the former were transferred to the Tribunal of the Sacred Rota. The "Corpus Juris" contains many of the decisions given by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in consistory, as is evidenced by the frequent formula de fratrun nostrorum consilio (with the advice of our brethren). The papal consistory has continued ever since to act as the supreme council of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, though it lost much of its importance when in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a> were instituted. The amount of business brought before the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> had gradually increased to such a vast extent that it had to be divided among several particular committees of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. These committees were at first temporary but gradually became permanent, and to each of them a definite kind of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs was assigned. These permanent committees came to be known as congregations. The first of them was instituted by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, others by <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>, but most of them owe their origin to <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>. Once the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>, embracing in their scope almost the whole range of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, were instituted, it was but natural that the papal consistory should lose in importance. However, it did not go into desuetude altogether; it continued to be held, but more rarely, and only in the form which me proceed to describe.
<h2 id="section3">Present practice</h2>

<p>Consistories are of three kinds: secret or ordinary, public or extraordinary and semi-public.

<p>(1) The secret consistory is so called because no one save the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> is present at its deliberations. Formerly it was customary for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, soon after entering the hall of consistory, to confer singly with the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> on such personal matters as they wished to bring before him, and it was only after this audience was over that nobles and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> were excluded from the hall. But at the present day this audience is omitted. The consistory is frequently opened with an address, or allocution, in which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> often reviews the condition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in general or in some particular country, pointing out what deserves praise or needs to be condemned. Such allocutions are afterwards given to the public in order that the world at large may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the mind of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on these matters. At the end of the allocution the creation of new <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> takes place. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> announces the names of those whom he intends to raise to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, and asks the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> for their opinion; the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> remove their caps as a sign of consent, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> proceeds immediately to the formal appointment. It is also in the secret consistory that the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> receive from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> ring, are appointed to some titular church or deaconry, exercise the option of passing from one titular church to another, and of ascending from the order of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to the order of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> respectively. It is also here that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appoints the camerlengo and the Vice-Chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy Roman Church</a>, and performs the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of "closing" and "opening" the mouth of the new <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. To this consistory belong also the appointments of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, the transfers of these dignitaries from one see to another, the appointments of coadjutors, the creation and announcement of new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, the division and union of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> already existing. But the details are not discussed in the consistory itself. All the previous consultations that are required in order that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> may come to a prudent conclusion have taken place in a congregation called consistorial, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the consistory itself only gives his decision. There are some sees whose <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are appointed through a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> outside the consistory. Such are those in territories depending on the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Sacred Congregation of Propaganda</a>, and others as necessity may require. These appointments are merely <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in the secret consistory. At the end of the consistory the advocates called consistorial are admitted to request, with the usual formalities, the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> for newly appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>; their petition is granted immediately, but the conferring of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> takes place later.

<p>(2) The public consistory is so called because <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> foreign to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College of Cardinals</a>, such as Apostolic prothonotaries, the auditors of the Sacred Rota, and other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> are called to it. Laymen also, who have made previous application, are permitted to be present. Formerly, in this consistory the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> used to give solemn reception to kings, princes, and ambassadors; but this is no longer the custom. In the public consistory the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> performs the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of delivering the red hat to the newly created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. Moreover, the consistorial advocates plead here the causes of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification and canonization</a>. These pleadings are of two kinds. In the first permission is asked that the ordinary process of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> or <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> may be introduced, or continued, or brought to completion. The second has reference only to causes of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>. For in accordance with the practice of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, even after it has been conclusively <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> required for <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> have been performed through the intercession of one declared blessed, the honours of a saint are not decreed to him, unless the question as to whether <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> should take place has been treated in three consistories: secret, public, and semi-public. In the secret consistory the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> asks the opinions of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, who express it singly by answering placet or non placet (aye or no). In the public consistory one of the consistorial advocates pleads the cause and a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> answers in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> name, inviting all to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in order that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> may be enlightened on the subject. The final voting takes place in the semi-public consistory.

<p>(3) The semi-public consistory is so called because, besides the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> also take part in it. To this consistory the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> residing within one hundred miles of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> are summoned, while invitations are sent to all the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; moreover, titular <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who live in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as well as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who happen to be sojourning there at the time, are likewise present. After all the Fathers have expressed their opinions on the subject, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> closes the assembly with an address on the following <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>. With regard to the time for holding the consistories, the old practice of assembling them at fixed intervals has passed out of use and today they meet, as occasion demands, at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> wish.
