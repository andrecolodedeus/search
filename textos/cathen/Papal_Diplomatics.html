<h1>Papal Diplomatics</h1>  

<p>The word <em>diplomatics</em>, following a Continental usage which long ago found recognition in <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon's</a> "De Re Diplomatic&acirc;", has of late come to denote also in English the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of ancient official documents, more especially of those emanating from the <a href="../cathen/04798c.htm">chanceries</a> of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, kings, emperors, and other authorities possessing a recognized <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Etymologically <em>diplomatics</em> should mean the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of diplomas, and <em>diploma</em>, in its classical acceptation, signified only a permit to use the <em>cursus publicus</em> (i.e. the public posting-service), or else a discharge accorded to veteran soldiers and imparting certain privileges. But the scholars of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> supposed that <em>diploma</em> was the correct classical term for an sort of charter, and from them the word came into use among jurists and historians and obtained general currency.
<h2>History of diplomatics</h2>

<p>There is abundant evidence that during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> a certain watchfulness, necessitated unfortunately by the prevalence of forgeries of all kinds, was exercised over the authenticity of <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a>, royal charters, and other instruments. In this control of documents and in the precautions taken against <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> the Chancery of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> set a good example. Thus we find <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> refraining even from attaching the usual leaden seal to a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> for fear it should fall into unscrupulous hands and be used for <a href="../cathen/06249a.htm">fraudulent</a> purposes (Dubitavimus hic sigillum plumbeum ponere ne si illud inimici caperent de eo falsitatem aliquam facerent. &mdash; Jaff&eacute;-L&ouml;wenfeld, "Regesta", no. 5225; cf. no. 5242); while we owe to <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> various rudimentary instructions in the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of diplomatics with a view to the detection of forgeries (see <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CCXIV, 202, 322, etc.). Seeing that even an ecclesiastic of the standing of <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> has been seriously accused of conniving at the fabrication of <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> (H. B&ouml;hmer, "Die F&auml;lschungen Erzbischof Lanfranks", 1902; cf. Liebermann's review in "Deutsche Literaturzeitung", 1902, p. 2798, and the defence of Lanfrane by L. Saltet in "Bulletin de litt. eccl.", <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, 1907, 227 sqq.), the need of some system of tests is obvious. But the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> criticism of documents was not very satisfactory even in the hands of a jurist like <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (see his comments on two pretended privileges of Popes Zacharias and Leo, Jaff&eacute;-L&ouml;wenfeld, "Regesta", no. 11,896), and though Laurentius Valla, the <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanist</a>, was right in denouncing the Donation of Constantine, and though the Magdeburg Centuriator, Matthias Flacius, was right in attacking the Forged <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>, their methods, in themselves, were often crude and inconclusive. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of diplomatics dates, in fact, only from the great <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> (1632-1707), whose fundamental work, "De Re Diplomatic&acirc;" (Paris, 1681), was written to correct the misleading principles advocated in the criticism of ancient documents by the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandist</a> Father Papenbroeck (Papebroch). To the latter's credit be it said that he at once publicly recognized the value of his rival's work and adopted his system. Other scholars were not so discerning, and assailants, like Germon and <a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and, in less degree, George Hickes in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, rejected <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon's</a> criteria; but the verdict of posterity is entirely in his favour, so that M. Giry quotes with approval the words of Dom Toustain: "His system is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one. Whoever follows any other road cannot fail to lose his way. Whoever seeks to build on any other foundation will build upon the sand." In point of fact., all that has been done since <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon's</a> time has been to develop his methods and occasionally to modify his judgments upon some point of detail. After the issue of a "Supplement" in 1704, a second, enlarged and improved edition of the "De Re Diplomatic&acirc;" was prepared by <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> himself and published in 1709, after his death, by his pupil, Dom Ruinart. Seeing, however, that this pioneer work had not extended to any documents later than the thirteenth century and had taken no account of certain classes of papers, such as the ordinary letters of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and privileges of a more private character, two other <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of St-Maur, Dom Toustain and <a href="../cathen/14463c.htm">Dom Tassin</a>, compiled a work in six large quarto volumes, with many facsimiles etc., known as the "Nouveau Trait&eacute; de Diplomatique" (Paris, 1750-1765), which, though it marks but a small advance on <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon's</a> own treatise, has been widely used, and has been presented in a more summary form by Dom Vaines and others.

<p>With the exception of some useful works specially <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to particular countries (e.g. <a href="../cathen/16058b.htm">Maffei</a>, "Istoria diplomatica", <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, 1727, unfinished; and Muratori, "De Diplomatibus Antiquis", included in his "Antiquitates Italic&aelig;", 1740, vol. III), as also the treatise of G. Marini on papyrus documents (I papiri diplomatici, Rome, 1805), no great advance was made in the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> for a century and a half after <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon's</a> death. The "Dictionnaire raisonn&eacute; de diplomatique chr&eacute;tienne", by M. Quentin, which forms part of <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne's</a> "Encyclopedia", is a rather unskilful digest of older works, and the sumptuous "El&eacute;ments de pal&eacute;ographie" of de Wailly (2 vols., 4to, 1838) has little independent merit. But within the last fifty years immense progress has been made in all diplomatic <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and not least of all in the study of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents. In the bibliography appended to the articles <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">BULLS AND BRIEFS</a> and <a href="../cathen/03048c.htm">BULLARIUM</a>, the reader will find references to the more important works. Amongst the pioneers of this revival the names of L&eacute;opold Delisle, the chief librarian of the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, Paris, and of M. de Mas-Latrie, professor at the Ecole de Chartres, as well as that of Julius von Pflugk-Harttung, the editor of a magnificent series of facsimiles of <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a>, deserve to occupy a foremost place; but their work has been carried on in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and elsewhere, often by those who are not themselves <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. It must be obvious that the photographic reproductions of documents which can now be procured so easily and cheaply have enormously facilitated that process of minute comparison of documents which forms the basis of all <a href="../cathen/11403a.htm">pal&aelig;ographic studies</a>. Further, the improvement in the cataloguing and the extension of facilities under <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> in such great <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> as that of the Vatican have made their contents much more accessible and have rendered possible such a calendar of early <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a> as has been appearing since 1902, being the results of the researches of Messrs. P. Kehr, A. Brackmann, and W. Wiederhold, in "Nachrichten der G&ouml;ttingen Gesellsehaft der Wissenschaften". Of the series of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <em>regesta</em> now being published by various scholars, especially by members of the Ecole Fran&ccedil;aise de <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, a sufficient account has been given in the second part of the article <a href="../cathen/03048c.htm">BULLARIUM</a>. Still greater progress in the study of diplomatics is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> to be looked for from the facilities afforded by the recently founded journal, "Archiv f&uuml;r Urkundenforschung" (Leipzig, 1907), edited by Messrs. Karl Brandi, H. Bresslau, and M. Tangl, all acknowledged masters in this subject.
<h2>Subject-matter of papal diplomatics</h2>

<p>As this topic has already been treated in part in the article <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">BULLS AND BRIEFS</a>, it will be sufficient here to recall the principal elements in the process of expediting ancient <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents, all of which need special attention. We have first of all the officials who are concerned in the preparation of such instruments and who collectively form the "Chancery". The constitution of the Chancery, which in the case of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> seems to date back to a <em>schola notariorum</em>, with a <em>primicerius</em> at its head, of which we hear under <a href="../cathen/08561a.htm">Pope Julius I</a> (337-352), varied from period to period, and the part played by the different officials composing it necessarily varied also. Besides the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> also had some sort of chancery for the issue of his own episcopal Acts. An acquaintance with the procedure of the Chancery is clearly only a study preparatory to the examination of the document itself. Secondly, we have the text of the document. As the position of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> became more fully recognized, the business of the Chancery increased, and we note a marked tendency to adhere strictly to the forms prescribed by traditional usage. Various collections of these formula, of which the <a href="../cathen/09215c.htm">"Liber Diurnus"</a> is one of the most ancient, were compiled at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. Many others will be found in the "Receuil g&eacute;n&eacute;ral des formules" by de Rozi&egrave;re (Paris, 1861-1871), though these, like the series published by Zeumer (Formul&aelig; Merovingici et Karolini &aelig;vi, Hanover, 1886), are mainly secular in character. After the text of the document, which of course varies according to its nature, and in which not merely the wording but also the rhythm (the so-called <em>cursus</em>) has often to be considered, attention must be paid; <ul><li>to the manner of dating, <li>to the signatures, <li>to the attestations of witnesses etc., <li>to the seals and the attachment of the seals, <li>to the material upon which it is written and to the manner of folding, as well as <li>to the handwriting</ul>

<p>Under this last heading the whole <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of <a href="../cathen/11403a.htm">pal&aelig;ography</a> may be said to be involved.

<p>All these matters fall within the scope of diplomatics, and all offer different tests for the authenticity of any given document. There are other details which often need to be considered, for example the Tironian (or shorthand) notes, which are of not infrequent occurrence in primitive <em>Urkunden</em>, both <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> and imperial, and which have only begun of late years to be adequately investigated (see Tangl, "Die tironischen Noten", in "Archiv f&uuml;r Urkundenforschung", 1907, I, 87-166). A special section in any comprehensive study of diplomatics is also likely to be devoted to spurious documents, of which, as already stated, the number is surprisingly great.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">Besides the books referred to in the course of this article see the bibliography of the article BULLS AND BRIEFS. A larger selection of authorities may be found in such treatises as those of GIRY, <em>Manuel de Diplomatique</em> (Paris, 1894); and BRESSLAU, <em>Handbuch der Urkundenlehre</em> (Leipzig, 1889), I. One very useful work for the study of papal diplomatics, the <em>Practica Cancellari&aelig; Apostolic&aelig;,</em> ed. SCHMITZ-KALLENBERG (Munich, 1904), though confined to the working of the Chancery at the close of the fifteenth century, is valuable for the indirect light thrown on other periods. Consult also the important work of TANGL, <em>Die p&auml;pstlichen Kanzlei-Ordnungen von 1200-1500</em> (Innsbruck, 1894); ERBEN, <em>Urkundenlehre</em> (Munich, 1907); and ROSEMUND, <em>Die Fortschritte der Diplomatik seit Mabillon</em> (Munich, 1897), though these last two books have little directly to do with papal documents. In A. MEISTER'S important work on early ciphers, <em>Die Anf&auml;nge der modernen diplomatischen Geheimschrift</em> (Paderborn, 1902), the papal Chancery is hardly mentioned (see, however, p. 34). Finally, the best summary account of papal diplomatics is to be found in the section contributed by SCHMITZ-KALLENBERG to the <em>Grundriss der Geschichtswissenschaft</em> (Leipzig, 1906). vol. I, pp. 172-230.</p></div>
