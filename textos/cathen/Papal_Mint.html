<h1>Papal Mint</h1>  

<p>The right to coin money being a sovereign prerogative, there can be no <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of earlier date than that of the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. Nevertheless, there are <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of <a href="../cathen/15743b.htm">Pope Zacharias</a> (741-52), of <a href="../cathen/06789a.htm">Gregory III</a> (Ficoroni, "Museo Kircheriano"), and, possibly, of <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Gregory II</a> (715-741). There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that these pieces, two of which are of silver, are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, and not merely a species of medals, like those which were distributed as "presbyterium" at the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> since the time of Valentine (827). Their stamp resembles that of the Byzantine and Merovingian <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of the seventh and eighth centuries, and their square shape is also found in Byzantine pieces. Those that bear the inscription GREII PAPE &mdash; SCI PTR (Gregorii Pap&aelig; &mdash; Sancti Petri) cannot be attributed to <a href="../cathen/06789b.htm">Pope Gregory IV</a> (827-44), because of the peculiarity of minting. The existence of these <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> yet recognized the Byzantine domination, is explained by Hartmann (Das K&ouml;nigreich Italien, Vol. III), who believes that, in the eighth century, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> received from the emperors the attributes of "Pr&aelig;fectus Urbis". Under the empire, <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> that were struck in the provinces bore the name of some local magistrate, and those <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of <a href="../cathen/06789a.htm">Gregory</a> and of Zacharias are simply imperial Byzantine pieces, bearing the name of the first civil magistrate of the City of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There are no <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Stephen III</a> or of <a href="../cathen/11577a.htm">Paul I</a>, who reigned when the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was already independent of the Eastern Empire; the first <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> are those of <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a>, from whose time until the reign of <a href="../cathen/08427b.htm">John XIV</a> (984) the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> coined money at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>There is no pontifical money of a date between the last-named year and 1305; this is explained, in part, by the fact that the Senate of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which sought to replace the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> in the temporal government of the city, took over the mint in 1143. On the other hand, Prince Alberic had already coined money in his own name. The <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of the Senate of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> usually bear the inscription "ROMA CAPUT MUNDI", or, S. P. Q. R., or both, with or without emblems. In 1188 the mint was restored to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (<a href="../cathen/04018a.htm">Clement III</a>), with the agreement, however, that half of its profits should be assigned to the <em>sindaco</em>, or mayor. The Senate, meanwhile, continued to coin money, and there is no reference, on the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of that time to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority. In the thirteenth century the Sindaco caused his own name to be stamped upon the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, and, consequently, we have <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of Brancaleone, of Charles I of Anjou, of Francesco Anguillara, viceroy of Robert of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, etc.; so, also, did King Ladislao. Cola di Rienzi, during his brief tribunate, likewise struck <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, with the inscription: N. TRIBUN. AUGUST.: ROMA CAPU. MU. Papal <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> reappeared with the removal of the pontifical Court to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, although there exists a single coin that is referred to <a href="../cathen/02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a> (1303-4), with the legend COITAT. VENASIN; as, however, this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> never resided in Venaissin, which had belonged to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> since 1274, the coin should be referred to <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a>. There are <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> from <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> to <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, and also the Senate when it coined money, appear to have used the imperial mint of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which was on the slope of the Campidoglio, not far from the Arch of <a href="../cathen/13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a>; but, in the fifteenth century, the mint was near the bank of Santo Spirito. Finally, in 1665, <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> moved it to the rear of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of St. Peter's, where it is at present. <a href="../cathen/02510b.htm">Bernini</a> invented for it a machine to do the work more rapidly, and <a href="../cathen/06570a.htm">Francesco Girardini</a> furnished a very sensitive balance; so that the mint of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was technically the most perfect one of those times. In 1845 <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> equipped it with the most modern appliances. The administration of the mint was at first entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/03217a.htm">camerlengo</a>; direct supervision, however, was exercised by the senate, from the time at least when that body took possession of the mint, until the reign of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>. The sindaco and the conservators of the <em>Camera Capitolina</em> appointed the masters of the mint, while the minting was witnessed by the heads of the guild of goldsmiths and silversmiths. In 1322 <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> created the office of treasurer for the mint of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and its incumbent, little by little, made himself independent of the <a href="../cathen/03217a.htm">camerlengo</a>. Later, the office of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> president of the mint was created. According to Lunadori (Relaz. della Corte di Roma, 1646), the establishments for the coining of money were in charge of a congregation of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>.

<p>Rome was not the only city of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a> that had a mint: prior to the year 1000, there existed at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> the former imperial mint, which was ceded in 996 to Archbishop Gerberto by <a href="../cathen/06790a.htm">Gregory V</a>; there were mints also at <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> and at <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, former residences of Lombard dukes. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, who was a feudatory of the emperor rather than of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, coined money as long as his temporal power over that city and its territory lasted. The mint of the Emperor Henry VI was established at Bologna in 1194, and nearly all of the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> struck there bear the motto BONONIA DOCET, or BONONIA MATER STUDIORUM. The <em>baiocchi</em> of Bologna were called <em>bolognini</em>, while the gold bolognino was equivalent to a gold sequin. The <em>lira</em>, also a Bolognese coin, was worth 20 bolognini. These <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> were struck in the name of the commune; it is only from the time when Bologna was recovered by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, under <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>, that Bolognese <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> may be regarded as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a>.



<p>Other cities had mints because they were the capitals of principalities subject to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, or in virtue of a privilege granted them by some prince; and when these <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> states fell to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, they retained the mints as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> establishments. This was so in the case of <a href="../cathen/03216c.htm">Camerino</a> (from <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> to <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>), <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a> and <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a> (under <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>), <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> (from <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>), <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> and <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> (from <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> to <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>). There were other cities to which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> granted a mint for limited periods of time, as <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a> (from <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> to <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>), Aquila (1486, when that city rebelled against Ferdinand I of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and gave its allegiance to <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>; its <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, which are very rare, bear the inscription AQUILANA LIBERTAS), Ascoli (from <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> to <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>), <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> (from <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> on), Carpentras (under <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>), Venaissin (from <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>), <a href="../cathen/05744a.htm">Fabriano</a> (under <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>), Fano (from <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> to <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>), Fermo (from <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>, 1390, to <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>), The Marches (from <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> to <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>), <a href="../cathen/09492a.htm">Macerata</a> (from <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> to <a href="../cathen/07004a.htm">Gregory XIV</a>), <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a> (under <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> and <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>), <a href="../cathen/10516a.htm">Montalto</a> (under <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>), <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a> (under <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>), the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">"Patrimony"</a> (from <a href="../cathen/02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a> to <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a>), <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> (from <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> to <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a>), <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> (from <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> to <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, and under <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>), Recanati (under <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>), Reggio (from <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> to <a href="../cathen/01159b.htm">Adrian VI</a>), <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> (under <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a>), Duchy of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, PROVINCI&AElig; DUCATUS (under <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a>), <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> (under <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> and <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>). <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, being <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to coin a great deal of copper money, gave the minting of it to a great many cities of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Patrimony</a>, of Umbria, and of the Marches, which, together with those already named, continued to strike these <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>; among them were <a href="../cathen/03798b.htm">Civitavecchia</a>, <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a>, <a href="../cathen/05744a.htm">Matelica</a>, Ronciglione (the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of 1799 showing the burning of this city are famous), <a href="../cathen/10704a.htm">Terni</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>. <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> suppressed all the mints except those of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and of Bologna.

<p>As far back as 1370 there were <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> struck during the vacancies of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, by authority of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/03217a.htm">camerlengo</a>, who, after the fifteenth century at least, caused his name and his <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">coat of arms</a> to be stamped on the reverse of the coin, the obverse bearing the words "SEDE VACANTE" and the date, surrounding the crossed keys surmounted by the pavilion. All <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>, with rare exceptions, bear the name of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, preceded (until the time of <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a>) by a Greek cross, and nearly all of the more ancient ones bear, either on the obverse or on the reverse, the words S. PETRUS, and some of them, the words S. PAULUS also. From <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a> to the Ottos, the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> bear the name of the emperor as well as that of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. After the sixteenth century the <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">coat of arms</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> alone frequently appears on pontifical <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>. There are also found images of the Saviour, or of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, symbolical figures of men or of animals, the keys (which appear for the first time on the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>), etc. From the sixteenth century to the eighteenth, Biblical or moral phrases are added, in allusion to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> or to the symbol that is stamped upon the coin, as, for example, MONSTRA TE ESSE MATREM, SPES NOSTRA, SUB TUUM PR&AElig;SIDIUM, TOTA PULCERA, SUPRA FIRMAM PETRAM, DA RECTA SAPERE (during the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">Conclave</a>), UBI THESAURUS IBI COR, CRESCENTEM SEQUITUR CURA PECUNIAM, HILAREM DATOREM DILIGIT DEUS, PRO PRETIO ANIM&AElig;, FERRO NOCENTIUS AURUM, IN SUDORE VULTUS, CONSERVAT&AElig; PEREUNT, TOLLE ET PROIICE, etc. Sometimes allusion is made to an historical event, as the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, or the deliverance of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1683), or to some concession of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to his subjects, or to a jubilee. From the time of <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a> the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> struck at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> bear a minute representation of the <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">coat of arms</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> in charge of the mint, a custom that obtained until 1817. The only instance of a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/03217a.htm">camerlengo</a> stamping his <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">coat of arms</a> on the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> during the lifetime of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is that of Cardinal Armellini, under <a href="../cathen/01159b.htm">Adrian VI</a>, in the case of four <em>grossi</em>.

<p>The mints outside of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> stamped the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> with the arms of their respective cities, or with those of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, of the vice-legate, or of the governor; thus, Cardinal Scipione Borghese in 1612 struck <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> with his own name and arms, omitting the name of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, an example that was followed a year later by the pro-legate Cardinal Filonardi. The city very often placed the image of its <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a> on its <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>. The date came to be stamped on <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> that were struck during the vacancies of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, occasionally at first, and later as a rule; it rarely appears on other <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> before 1550; the practice became general in the seventeenth century, the year of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era or that of the pontificate being used; and <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> established it by law, as also the requirement that each coin should bear upon it an expression of its value. At Bologna as early as the seventeenth century, the value of gold or silver <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> was usually indicated with the figures 20, 40, 80, etc., i.e. so many bolognini or baiocchi; at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in the eighteenth century, nearly all the copper <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> bore an indication of their value. The rim of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> rarely bore an inscription; at most, the monogram of the city in which the coin was struck was stamped upon it. From the sixteenth century, the engravers, also, put their ciphers on the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>; among these engravers may be named Benvenuto Cellini, Francesco Raibolini, called il Francia (Bologna), the four Hamerani, <a href="../cathen/06572a.htm">Giulio Romano</a> (trident), Cavaliere Lucenti, Andrea Perpenti, etc. Until the time of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, the dies for the mint remained the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the engravers.

<p>The Byzantine monetary system is followed in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a> until the reign of <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a>, after which the system of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire obtains. <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> adopted the Florentine system, and coined gold forms; the weight of this coin, however, varied from 22 carats to 30, until <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> reduced it to the original 24 carats; but deterioration came again, and then there were two kinds of florins, the <em>papal</em> florin, which maintained the old weight, and the florin <em>di Camera</em>, the two being in the ratio of 69 <em>papal</em> florins = 100 florins <em>di Camera</em> = 1 gold pound = 10 <em>carlini</em>. The ducat was coined in the papal mint from the year 1432; it was a coin of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> origin that circulated with the florin, which, in 1531, was succeeded by the <em>scudo</em>, a piece of French origin that remained the monetary unit of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>. At the same time, there appeared the <em>zecchino</em>. The ancient <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> florin was equal to 2 scudi and 11 baiocchi (1 baiocco = 0.01 scudi); one ducat was equal to one scudo and 9 baiocchi. The scudo also underwent fluctuations, in the market and in its weight: the so called <em>scudo delle stampe</em> (1595) was worth 1842 baiocchi, that is, a little less than 2 scudi. <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> re-established the good quality of the alloy, but under <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> it again deteriorated. In 1835 <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> regulated the monetary system of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>, establishing the scudo as the unit, and dividing it into 100 baiocchi, while the baiocco was divided into 5 quattrini (the quattrino, until 1591, had been equal to &#188; of a baiocco). The scudo was coined both in gold and in silver; there were pieces of 10 scudi, called Gregorine; and pieces of 5 scudi, and of 2&#189; scudi were also coined. The scudo of the eighteenth century was equal to l65 scudi of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, which last was adopted by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>; the zecchino was worth 22 scudi. The scudo is equal to 53 lire in the monetary system of the Latin Union. The fractional silver <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> were the half scudo, and the <em>giulio</em>, called also <em>paolo</em>, which was equal to 01 seudi. The latter coin was created by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> in order to put the <em>carlini</em> of Charles of Anjou out of circulation, these <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> being of bad alloy. There were pieces of 2 <em>giulii</em> that were called <em>papetti</em>, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <em>lire</em> at Bologna, a name that was later given to them officially. A <em>grosso</em>, introduced in 1736, was equal to half a giulio (25 baiocchi); there were also the <em>mezzogrosso</em>, and the <em>testone</em> = 30 giulii. The copper <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> were the baiocco or soldo (which was called bolognino, at Bologna) and the 2 baiocchi piece. The name baiocco is derived from that of the city of <a href="../cathen/02358b.htm">Bayeux</a>.

<p>Other <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> that were used at various times in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a> were the <em>baiocchella</em> = 1 baiocco, a copper piece with a silver surface, and therefore smaller than the copper baiocco; there were <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> made of the two metals of the values, respectively, of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 baiocchi; the copper <em>madonnina</em> (Bologna) = 5 baiocchi; the <em>sampietrino</em> (<a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>) = 2&#189; baiocchi; the <em>paludella</em> was a soldo, made of an alloy of copper and silver, established by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> as a more easily portable specie with which to pay the workmen of the Pontine Marshes; the <em>sesino</em> = 04 of a baiocco = 2 quattrini; the <em>leonina</em> (<a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a>) = 44 Gregorian scudi; the <em>doblone</em> = 2 old scudi = 33 scudi of the nineteenth century; there were dobloni of the relative values of 4, 8, and 16 scudi; the <em>doppio</em> was worth a little less than the doblone, that is, 321 scudi of the nineteenth Century; at Bologna there were also coined scudi of 80 baiocchi, and half-scudi of 40 baiocchi; the <em>gabella</em> was a Bolognese coin, equivalent to a carlino or giulio; the <em>gabellone</em> was equivalent to 26 bolognini (baiocchi); the <em>franco</em>, in the fifteenth century, was worth 12 baiocchi at Bologna, but only 10 baiocchi at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; the <em>alberetti</em> was a two-baiocco piece that was coined by the Roman Republic (1798-99).

<p>No official collection of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> was made before the time of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, who acquired from <a href="../cathen/11521c.htm">Cardinal Passionei</a> the valuable collection of Scilla which was enriched later by other acquisitions; in 1809, however, it was taken to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and was never recovered. In the nineteenth century the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> obtained possession of the fine collection of Belli, begun in the previous century by Luigi Tommasini, and this collection became the basis of the Numismatic Cabinet, which is under the direction of the prefect of the Vatican Library and has a special custodian. Since the loss of the temporal power, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has not coined money; each year, however, he strikes the customary medal for the feast of Saint Peter, which is given to <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and to the employees of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>.
