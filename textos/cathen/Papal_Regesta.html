<h1>Papal Regesta</h1>  

<p>Papal Regesta are the copies, generally entered in special registry volumes, of the <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letters</a> and official documents that are kept in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> archives; the name, further, is also used to indicate the modern publications containing such documents in chronological order with careful summaries of their essential contents. The beginnings of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> regesta probably antedate Constantine. There is, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, no direct <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the making and preservation of copies of the official documents of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> in this period. The growth of the correspondence of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">papal see</a>, however, is evident even by the end of the second century, from the controversy over the celebration of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and is also shown about the middle of the third century by the disorders of the <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, by the dispute concerning <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and by other occasions. Moreover, it was important for the officials of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> to have the opportunity to inspect its earlier correspondence and to be able to use it for similar cases. For these reasons there is hardly any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that from a very early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> a copy was made of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents before their dispatch, and that the collection of these documents was preserved at the seat of the central administration of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. This theory can all the more easily be accepted, as the highest officials of the Roman State administration, the imperial chancery, the Senate, the consuls, the provincial governments, had all official documents entered in such volumes and preserved in the archives. The books in which these documents were entered were called <em>commentarii, regesta</em>, the latter word from <em>regerere</em>, to inscribe. The existence of such <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> regesta can be positively <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> for the fourth century and the succeeding era. In his polemic with Rufinus ("Apolog. adv. Rufinum", III, xx), <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> refers to the archives (<em>chartarium</em>) of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, where the letter of Pope Anastasius (399-401) on the controversy over the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> was preserved. There are also notices concerning the registration of <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letters</a> in the documents of several <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of the fifth century. Thus <a href="../cathen/15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a> in his letter of 22 Sept., 417, to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Africa refers to the fact that all the earlier negotiations with Coelestius had been examined at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (<a href="../cathen/04454a.htm">Coustant</a>, "Epist. Rom. Pontif.", 955). Consequently copies of the documents in question must have existed. From this time onwards it remained the fixed custom of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancery to copy the official papers issued by it in registers.

<p>From the centuries previous to the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> (1199-1216) there remain only fragments of the registry volumes of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancery and these in large part merely in later copies. Nearly all the volumes of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> regesta up to the end of the twelfth century have disappeared. The frequent local <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the conflagrations from which the city suffered explained sufficiently the loss of the oldest records. The most important fragments of this period that have been preserved are the following: nearly 850 letters, in three groups, of the Regesta of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory I</a> (590-604). An investigation <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the original Regesta consisted of fourteen papyrus volumes, corresponding to the number of years of the pontificate, which were arranged according to indictions; that each of these volumes was divided into twelve parts, before each of which the name of the corresponding month was written. In this way information is attained as to plan of the earliest volumes of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Regesta. A <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the Vatican archives contains letters of <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a> (872-882). which begins with September, 876, and extend to the end of the pontificate. This is not an original register, but a copy of the eleventh century. Separate letters, fifty-five in number, belonging to the first four years of the pontificate of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, exist in a collection contained in a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the twelfth century in the British Museum, <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (<a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> Add. 8874). The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> contains letters of Gelasius I (492-96), <a href="../cathen/11602a.htm">Pelagius I</a> (556-561), <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> (847-55), <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a> (872-82), <a href="../cathen/14289c.htm">Stephen V</a> (885-91), <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a> (1061-73), and <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> (1088-99). The study of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> by Ewald ["Neues Archiv", V (1880), 275 sqq., 503 sqq.] led to important conclusions concerning the volumes of the Regesta. Another <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a> contains some seventy letters from the Regesta of <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a> (1154-59), <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (1159-81), and Lucius III (1181-85) [see L&ouml;wenfeld in "Neues Archiv", X, 1885, 585 sqq.]. Again, large parts of the Regesta of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> (1073-85), namely 381 letters, are contained in a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in the Vatican archives. This collection is also only an extract of the original Regesta. In it the letters are no longer arranged according to indictions, but according to the year of the pontificate. A fraction of the Regesta of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/01447a.htm">Anacletus II</a> (1130-38), containing thirty-eight letters of various contents, has been preserved in a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> (Ewald in "Neues Archiv", III, 164 sqq.). Besides these collections of letters which have preserved fragments of the earliest <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Regesta, rich material is also to be found in the canonical collections of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. In part these collections go back directly or indirectly to the volumes of the Regesta of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> archives, from which the authors of these collections, as <a href="../cathen/01550d.htm">Anselm of Lucca</a>, and above all Deusdedit, gathered the greater part of their material. From <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> onward the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> volumes of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Regesta still exist in the Vatican Archives.

<p>The Regesta of the thirteenth century are beautifully written parchment volumes. Yet the most of these in their present form have been made from older volumes. How these older volumes, the real original Regesta, were planned cannot be decided. From the fourteenth century onward, registry volumes of paper were used for the entering of the copies. However, when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> returned from <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, these paper Regesta were left at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and copies of them were made in parchment registry volumes that were brought to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At a later era, the original Regesta volumes were also brought to the Vatican Archives so that there are two series in existence for the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> epoch of the fourteen century. From the fourteenth century onwards the volumes of the Regesta were generally made of paper. Numerous investigations have been made by various scholars as to the arrangement of the volumes of the Regesta, the rules or customs observed in the entering of the separate pieces, as to the question of whether the draft or the finished letter was copied, and as to many other matters in diplomatics, without reaching very certain results. In the thirteenth century the letters were divided into "Litter&aelig; communes" and "Litter&aelig; de curia" or "Curiales", the latter dealing mostly with affairs of general importance. At a later date other headings (<em>litter&aelig; secret&aelig;, litter&aelig; de beneficiis</em>) were also introduced. Besides the regular Regesta of the <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letters</a> made in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancery, there were similar Regesta of the <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letters</a> executed since the fourteenth century in the Apostolic Camera. From about the middle of the fourteenth century the registers of petitions were also preserved, in which were entered, not the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents, but the memorials to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in reply to which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents were issued.

<p>As collections of the official documents of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancery, the Regesta are a very important historical authority. For convenience in historical investigation various scholars have published in chronological order all known <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> documents of large periods, with brief summaries of the contents of the letters. The three greatest collections of this kind are: Jaff&eacute;, "Regesta Pontificum Romanorum ab condita ecclesia ad annum p. Chr. n. 1198"; 2nd ed. by S. L&ouml;wenfeld, F. Kaltenbrunner, P. Ewald (2 vols., Leipzig, 1888). P. F. Kehr has undertaken a new edition of the Regesta for this period in topographical and at the same time chronological order: "Regesta Pontif. Roman.: Italia Pontifica" (Berlin, 1906&mdash;); "Germania Pontificia" (Berlin, 1910); with the cooperation of other scholars he is still carrying on his great undertaking. Jaff&eacute;'s work was supplemented by Potthast, "Regesta Pontificum Romanorum inde ab an p. Chr. n. 1198 ad an. 1304 (2 vols., Berlin, 1874-75). Letters of several <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> taken from the volumes of the Regesta have been published by: L&ouml;wenfeld: "Epistol&aelig; Pontificum Romanorum inedit&aelig;" (Leipzig, 1885) taken from the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>; Rodenberg, "Epistol&aelig; s&aelig;c. XIII e Regestis Rom. Pont. select&aelig;" (Berlin, 1883 &mdash;), in "Mon. Germ. Hist." The Regesta of the letters of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory I</a> were edited again by Ewald and Hartmann, "Gregorii I Registrum epistolarum" in "Mon. Germ. Hist." (Berlin, 1891 &mdash;). The letters of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> were edited by Jaff&eacute;, "Monumenta Gregoriana" in "Bibliotheca Rerum Germanicarum" (2 vols., Berlin, 1868). As early as 1591 the records of <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a> were published from the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> in the Vatican. Of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of the thirteenth century, Pressuti edited (Rome, 1888-96) the Regesta on <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> (1216-27) from the volumes of the Regesta in the Vatican Archives; the Regesta of the succeeding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> to <a href="../cathen/02661c.htm">Boniface VII</a> (d. 1303) were edited by the members of the Ecole Fran&ccedil;oisaise of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the publication of the Regesta of all the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> being yet incomplete; after a group of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> had issued the Regesta of <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> (1305-14), the members of the Ecole Fran&ccedil;oisaise began again with <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> (1316-34), with the intention of publishing the Regesta of the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> to <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> (1370-78). In this later series, besides the documents of general interest, they kept in view particularly those documents that bore on the history of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. For the later eras only the first numbers were published of the Regesta of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> (1513-21), edited by <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Cardinal Hergenr&ouml;ther</a> (see under the different <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>). In addition a number of works have been issued or are in course of publication that contain Regesta from the Vatican Regesta of the fourteenth century, bearing on special questions or on the history of various countries and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, e.g., Werunsky, "Excerpts ex registris Clementis VI et Innocenti VI (Innsbruck, 1885); Ruezler, "Vatikanische Akten zur deutschen Geschichte in der Zeit Ludwigs des Bayern" (Munich, 1890).
