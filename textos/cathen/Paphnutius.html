<h1>Paphnutius</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>The most celebrated personage of this name was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of a city in the Upper <a href="../cathen/14561a.htm">Thebaid</a> in the early fourth century, and one of the most interesting members of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (325). He suffered mutilation of the left knee and the loss of his right eye for the Faith under the <a href="../cathen/10077b.htm">Emperor Maximinus</a> (308-13), and was subsequently condemned to the mines. At Nic&aelig;a he was greatly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>, who, according to <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> (<a href="../fathers/26011.htm"><em>Church History</em> I.11</a>), used often to send for the good old confessor and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> the place whence the eye had been torn out. He took a prominent, perhaps a decisive, part in the debate at the First &OElig;cumenical Council on the subject of the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy of the clergy</a>. It seems that most of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> present were disposed to follow the precedent of the Council of Elvira (can. xxxiii) prohibiting conjugal relations to those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and, according to <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a>, sub-deacons, who were married before <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. Paphnutius earnestly entreated his fellow-bishops not to impose this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> on the orders of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> concerned. He proposed, in accordance "with the ancient tradition of the Church", that only those who were <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibates</a> at the time of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> should continue to observe continence, but, on the other hand, that "none should be separated from her, to whom, while yet unordained, he had been united". The great veneration in which he was held, and the well known fact that he had himself observed the strictest chastity all his life, gave weight to his proposal, which was unanimously adopted. The council left it to the discretion of the married <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to continue or discontinue their marital relations. Paphnutius was present at the Synod of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> (335).
<h2 id="section1">I</h2>

<p>PAPHNUTIUS, surnamed (on account of his love of solitude) THE BUFFALO, an <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Scetic <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> in the fourth century. When Cassian (Coll., IV, 1) visited him in 395, the Abbot Paphnutius was in his ninetieth year. He never left his cell save to attend church on Saturdays and <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, five miles away. When in his paschal letter of the year 399, the Patriarch Theophilus of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> condemned <a href="../cathen/01558c.htm">anthropomorphism</a>, Paphnutius was the only monastic ruler in the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> who caused the document to be read.
<h2 id="section3">III</h2>

<p>PAPHNUTIUS, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the church of Boou, in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, under the Prefect Culcianus.
