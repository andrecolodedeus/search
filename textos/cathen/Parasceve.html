<h1>Parasceve</h1>  

<p>(Gr. <em>paraskev&eacute;</em>); seems to have supplanted the older term <em>pros&aacute;bbaton</em>, used in the translation of <a href="../bible/jth008.htm#vrs6">Judith 8:6</a>, and in the title&mdash;not to be found in Hebrew&mdash;of <a href="../bible/psa092.htm">Psalm 92</a>. It became, among Hellenistic <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the name for Friday, and was adopted by Greek <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers after writing of "The Teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a>". Apparently it was first applied by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to the afternoon of Friday, then to the whole day, its etymology pointing to the "preparations" to be made for the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, as indicated in the <a href="../cathen/02141a.htm">King James Bible</a>, where the Greek word is translated by "Day of Preparation". That the regulations of the Law might be minutely observed, it was made imperative to have on the Parasceve three meals of the choicest food laid ready before sunset (the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> beginning on Friday night); it was forbidden to undertake in the afternoon of the sixth day any business which might extend to the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>; <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> relieved the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from certain legal <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> from the ninth hour (Josephus, "Antiq. Jud.", XVI, vi, 2).

<p><em>Parasceve</em> seems to have been applied also to the eve of certain festival days of a sabbatic character. Foremost among these was the first day of the unleavened bread, Nisan 15. We learn from the Mishna (Pesach., iv, 1, 5) that the Parasceve of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a>, whatever day of the week it fell on, was kept even more religiously than the ordinary Friday, in Jud&aelig;a work ceasing at noon, and in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> the whole day being free. In the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> the only question discussed regarding this particular Parasceve was when should the rest commence: <a href="../cathen/13751a.htm">Shammai</a> said from the very beginning of the day (evening of Nisan 13); <a href="../cathen/07354c.htm">Hillel</a> said only from after sunrise (morning of Nisan 14).

<p>The use of the word Parasceve in the Gospels raises the question concerning the actual day of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> crucifixion. All the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> state that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> died on the day of the Parasceve (<a href="../bible/mat027.htm#vrs62">Matthew 27:62</a>; <a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs42">Mark 15:42</a>; <a href="../bible/luk023.htm#vrs54">Luke 23:54</a>; <a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs14">John 19:14, 31</a>), and there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> from <a href="../bible/luk023.htm#vrs54">Luke 23:54-56</a> and <a href="../bible/joh019.htm">John 19:31</a>, that this was Friday. But on what day of the month of Nisan did that particular Friday fall? St. John distinctly points to Nisan 14, while the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">Synoptists</a>, by implying that the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> was the Paschal meal, convey the impression that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was crucified on Nisan 15. But this is hardly reconcilable with the following facts: when <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> left the table, the disciples imagined he was going to buy the things which were needed for the feast (<a href="../bible/joh013.htm#vrs29">John 13:29</a>)&mdash;a purchase which was impossible if the feast had begun; after the Supper, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> and his disciples left the city, as also did the men detailed to arrest Him&mdash;this, on Nisan 15, would have been contrary to <a href="../bible/exo012.htm#vrs22">Exodus 12:22</a>; the next morning the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had not yet eaten the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>; moreover, during that day the Council convened; Simon was apparently coming from work (<a href="../bible/luk023.htm#vrs26">Luke 23:26</a>); <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and the two robbers were executed and were taken down from the crosses; <a href="../cathen/08520a.htm">Joseph of Arimathea</a> bought fine linen (<a href="../bible/mar015.htm#vrs46">Mark 15:46</a>), and Nicodemus brought "a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound weight" (<a href="../bible/joh019.htm#vrs39">John 19:39</a>) for the burial; lastly the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> prepared spices for the embalming of the Saviour's body (<a href="../bible/luk023.htm#vrs55">Luke 23:55</a>)&mdash;all things which would have been a <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a> on Nisan 15. Most commentators, whether they think the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> to have been the Paschal meal or an anticipation thereof, hold that Christ, as St. John states, was crucified on the Parasceve of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Pasch</a>, Friday, Nisan 14.
