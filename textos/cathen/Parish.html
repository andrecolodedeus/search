<h1>Parish</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>par&oelig;cia, parochia</em>, Greek <em>paroikia</em>, a group of neighbouring dwellings).
<h3 id="A">General notions</h3>

<p>A parish is a portion of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> under the authority of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> legitimately appointed to secure in virtue of his office for the faithful dwelling therein, the helps of religion. The faithful are called parishioners, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <em>parochus</em>, <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a>, parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. To form a parish there must be (1) a certain body of the faithful over whom pastoral authority is exercised; the ordinary manner of determining them is by assigning a territory subject to the exclusive <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Uncertainty of parish boundaries may work harm and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV, c. xiii, de ref.) orders the boundaries of parishes to be defined. The faithful become parishioners by acquiring a domicile or a quasi-domicile (see <a href="../cathen/05103b.htm">DOMICILE</a>) within the territory, or by simply living in it for a month (<a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a>, "Ne temere", on marriage, 2 August, 1907). Travellers, however, may address themselves to the parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the locality, though without detriment to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of their own <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. The exclusive attribution of a territory to a parish and its <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> is not absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>; certain parishes coexist with others in the same territory, the respective parishes being distinguished by rite or nationality, e.g. in the Orient or in large American cities. There are even rare instances of parishes formed solely of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, without regard to territory. (2) A special <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, having in virtue of his title a mission and authority to give religious succour to the parishioners, is required. In strict law, the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in a single parish must devolve on several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and in fact, such was formerly the case in most chapters (q.v.); but the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV, c. xiii, de ref.) commands <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to assign to each parish its own individual <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>. If the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is entrusted to a moral body, like a chapter, it must be exercised by a vicar, perpetual as far as possible, who is called the "actual" <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a>, the chapter remaining the "habitual" <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a>, without right of interfering in any way in the parochial ministry (Sess. VII, c. vii).

<p>The parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may have assistants, but the latter exercise their ministry in dependence on him and in his name. If the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, even when alone, does not exercise his office in his own name, if he is only the delegate of a higher authority, he is not really a parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and his district is not a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> parish. That is why there are no real parishes (as there are no real <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>) but only stations in <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariates Apostolic</a> and missionary countries. The same may occur in <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> during the provisional period which precedes the erection of certain districts into parishes. But the parish exists, when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> exercises the ministry in his own name, whether his title be perpetual or he be removable at the will of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. From this results (3) parochial law, i.e., the reciprocal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and parishioners. This constitutes the care of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> (<em>cura animarum</em>), an essential and constitutive element of a parish, distinguishing a parochial <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> from all others. Finally there is required (4) a suitable church which must have besides the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> equipment <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for Divine worship, a <a href="../cathen/02274a.htm">baptismal font</a> (exception is occasionally made in favour of a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> or a mother-church; hence in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> parish churches were often called <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> churches), a confessional, and a cemetery. Records of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, and burials must be kept, while the entire parish is the object of a <em>liber status animarum</em>, prescribed by the Ritual. Finally, the parish has fixed or occasional contributions for Divine service, the building, <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> furniture, parochial works, and all that implies an administration. Local <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> determine the share of the parishioners or their representatives in this administration. The parish must likewise furnish the parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> with his presbytery or dwelling.
<h3 id="B">The parish as a benefice</h3>

<p>The canonical legislation relative to parishes is part of the legislation concerning <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. To the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is annexed by <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, by its purpose distinct from any other. All parishes are <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, at least in the wide acceptation of the term; according to canon law, every church should have a stable income, especially land revenues, sufficient to insure not only the Divine service but also the support of its <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Every parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> ought to have a fixed beneficial revenue, his <em>congrua</em>, the minimum of which is fixed by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV, c. xiii, de ref.), at one hundred ducats (about one hundred and forty-two dollars), a sum insufficient today; the congrua may be replaced by contributions from the public treasury, in certain countries, paid in return for former <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> now confiscated. Parishes without fixed incomes are nevertheless <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in a broad sense of the term, since they insure a living for their parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> by gifts and offerings, either <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> or payable on the occasion of certain acts of the curial ministry, according to rates approved by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Parishes, like other <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, may be divided into several classes. Most parishes are "free", i.e. the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself selects the incumbent; but others are subject to the right of patronage; the patrons present to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> their candidate. Most parishes are independent, but some are united to other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> bodies: chapters, dignities (high <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices), <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. By <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> they are served by the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> and are hence called secular parishes; but some, united to houses of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, are served by religious and are consequently termed regular. Those confided to religious in virtue of a personal title, are not properly speaking regular.



<p>The <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">care of souls</a> places parochial <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in a special category, and has led to regulations peculiar to them alone.

<p>(1) Parishes, to be "free", i.e. freely collated, should be conferred by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> within six months like other <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>; but his choice is limited by the concursus ordered by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXIV, c. xviii, de ref.).

<p>(2) By <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>, a parochial <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>, like other <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, is perpetual, and the beneficiary irremovable (see <a href="../cathen/08173a.htm">IRREMOVABILITY</a>; <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a>, "Maxima cura", 20 August, 1910). According to this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who were heretofore removable are now withdrawn from purely administrative transference. Irremovable parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> may have their faculties withdrawn, without any trial properly so called, when the good of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> demands it. The nine reasons given in the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> as grounds for this withdrawal of faculties relate to corporal or spiritual defects, criminal conduct, serious and prolonged neglect of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, persistent disobedience; these reasons, however, are not here dealt with as crimes, but solely as obstacles to a useful parochial ministry; hence the parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on being removed is to be provided for. This administrative procedure adequately secures the right of initiative <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and at the same time safeguards the interests of the parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. It comprises three stages: the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who thinks that a parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is no longer working faithfully among his flock, is bound to select as counsellors two of the synodal or pro-synodal examiners, in order of their <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a>, and explain the situation to them. If the majority decides to remove the parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must first officially request him to resign within ten days under threat of pronouncing a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of removal. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may reply to the reasons alleged against him, and his answer is examined by this council; if the reply is deemed unsatisfactory, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> issues the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> and notifies the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Properly speaking the latter cannot appeal from the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, but he may present his case to a new council, composed of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and two parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> as consultors, who examine whether the reasons given for the removal have been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> and whether the formalities demanded by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> have been observed; a majority vote decides (see Council of Trent, Sess. XXI, c. vi, de ref.).

<p>(3) The same <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the welfare of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> inspires special legislation for the erection and division of parishes. The erection of a parish takes place by creation when the district and the faithful assigned to the new parish did not belong previously to any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. This case is extremely rare, as usually the territory of each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is divided into parishes more or less extensive. A parish is created when a centre of religious activity becomes canonically recognized as a parish, as when a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicariate Apostolic</a> is erected into a diocese. The erection of parishes usually takes place by dismemberment or division. While in theory the division of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> is looked on unfavorably by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (c. 8 de Pr&aelig;bendis), it is authorized and even necessitated by the welfare of the faithful in the case of parishes. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXI, c. iv, de ref.), referring expressly to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Ad audientiam" of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (lib. III, tit. 48, c. 3), desires <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as delegates of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, to establish new parishes, in spite of the parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> opposition, wherever distance or difficulty of communication does not allow the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to frequent the church. In cities an excessive increase of population necessitates the multiplication of parishes. The Council in such a case desires <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">oblige</a> the parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to have sufficient number of assistants; but if the population is too great for the parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, "to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his sheep" (Sess. XXI, c. i), the erection of a new parish is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> and the Congregation of the Council has several times recognized this as a legitimate reason. The legal formalities for the erection of a new parish further require the request either of the parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> whose parish is to be divided, or of other interested <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, if there be any such; the consent of the chapter, unless custom has ruled otherwise; finally the guarantee of a sufficient income for the new parish, either by a partition of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the dismembered parish or parishes, or at least by the contributions of the inhabitants of the new one. The erection is effected by an episcopal <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. As a rule a special kinship exists between the old and the new parishes; the old being called the "mother" and the new the "filial" parish, the latter being bound to make certain offerings to the former, generally honorary, e.g., the annual gift of a candle. Special "foundations" of the old parish, created for the benefit, not of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but of the faithful (<a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> for the poor) are divided pro rata. Finally, the same procedure is observed for the extinction or suppression of a parish, by its union with another, when the number of the faithful has decreased so as no longer to warrant the presence of a parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.
<h3 id="C">History</h3>

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities were founded in cities and the entire Divine service was carried on by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; the few faithful outside the cities went to the city or were visited from time to time by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> from the presbyteries. In the fourth century we find in the villages groups sufficiently large to be served by a resident <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Canon 77 of Elvira (about A.D. 300) speaks of a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> in charge of the people (<em>diaconus regens plebem</em>). In the East at a very early period the churches of the cities and of the country districts were organized; the Council of Neoc&aelig;sarea, about 320 (can. 13), speaks of country <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of villages, the "chorepiscopi", who had a subordinate <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Such churches and their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were originally under the direct administration of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; but soon they had their own resources and a distinct administration (<a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, 451, can. 4, 6, 17). The same change took place in the West, but more slowly. In proportion as the country districts were evangelized (fourth to sixth centuries), churches were erected, at first in the vici (hamlets or villages), afterwards on church lands or on the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, and at least one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was appointed to each church. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> depended at first directly on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; the churches did not yet correspond to very definite territorial circumscriptions: the centre was better marked than the boundaries. Such was the church which the councils of the sixth and seventh century call <em>ecclesia rusticana</em>, <em>parochitana</em>, often <em>dioecesis</em>, and finally <em>parochia</em>. By that time most of these churches had become independent: the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> administered the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> assigned to him by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and also the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> given directly to the church by the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> faithful; from that moment the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> became a beneficiary and had his title. More plentiful resources required and permitted a more numerous <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The devotion of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, especially towards <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, led to the erection of numerous secondary <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, <em>oratoria, basilic&aelig;, martyria</em>, which also had their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. But these <em>tituli minores</em> were not parishes; they depended on the principal church of the <em>vicus</em>, and on the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> so often mentioned in the councils of the sixth and seventh centuries, who had authority over his own <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and those of the <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>.

<p>These secondary churches emphasize the parochial character of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> churches, as the faithful had to receive the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and pay their <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in the latter. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in turn ministered to the people grouped around them. From the eighth century parochial centres multiplied on the lands of the churches and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and the <em>vill&aelig;</em> or great estates of the kings and nobles. Then the <em>vill&#163;</em> were subdivided and the parish served a certain number of <em>vill&aelig;</em> or rural districts, and thus the parish church became the centre of the religious and even the civil life of the villages. This condition, established in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, has scarcely varied since, as far as concerns the parochial service. As <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, however, parishes have undergone many vicissitudes, owing to their union with <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> or chapters, and on account of the inextricable complications of the <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> order. Parish churches had ordinarily attached to them <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and charitable works, especially for the poor enrolled on the <em><a href="../cathen/10052a.htm">matricula</a></em>, or list of those attached to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the episcopal and other cities the division into parishes took place much more slowly, the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> or the archipresbyteral church being for a long time the only parochial church. However, numerous the city churches, all depended on it and, properly speaking, had no flock of their own. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as early as the fourth century, there was a quasi-parochial service in the "titles" and cemeterial churches (Innocent I to Decentius, c. 5, an. 416). It is only towards the close of the eleventh century that separate urban parishes began; even then there were limitations, e.g. <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was to be conferred in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; the territories, moreover, were badly defined. The chapters turned over to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the churches the parochial ministry, while the corporations (guilds) insisted especially on the granting of parochial <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to the churches which they founded and supported.
<h2>In English-speaking countries</h2>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and English-speaking lands generally (with the exception of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and possibly <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>), it has not been found advisable as yet to erect canonical parishes. The districts confided to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> having the cure of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are technically designated as missions or quasi-parishes, though in common parlance the word <em>parish</em> is employed. The establishment of canonical parishes in these countries was not found possible, owing either to the devastation wrought in the so-called <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> period or to the fact that, as new lands were slowly evangelized and settled, circumstances did not allow the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> parochial system as prescribed in her canon law.
<h3 id="A">The missions or quasi-parishes</h3>

<p>Certain churches are designated by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> which are to be regarded as parish churches (<em>ad instar par&aelig;ciarum</em>). Over these churches are placed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> provided with the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> faculties. They are designated missionary rectors, or quasi-parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, though familiarly referred to as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> or parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. A certain district around each church is then more or less definitely marked out by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, within the limits of which the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> is to exercise <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the faithful and have care of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> buildings. Within the limits of such missions or quasi-parishes, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may institute new <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> divisions when such action becomes advisable. If the parish be held by members of a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is not thereby constrained to entrust the newly-formed district to regulars. The institution of new quasi-parishes in English-speaking countries proceeds generally along the same lines as those prescribed by Church law for the erection of canonical parishes. Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can erect a new parish by way of creation, union, or division. If the territory in question has not yet been assigned to any parish church, the institution is said to be by way of creation. There cannot be the slightest <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can proceed to such action in virtue of his powers as ordinary of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In creating such new parish, he is bound to provide as far as possible for the proper support of the now incumbent. In English-speaking countries there is no necessity of recurring to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> for the creation of a new parish. When the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> establishes new quasi-parishes by way of division, he is not required to observe all the formalities prescribed by law for the dismemberment of canonical parishes. He must, nevertheless, act on the advice of his consultors, and after hearing the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> whose territory is to be divided. It is obvious that a division which would cripple or impoverish the church would not be in the best interests of religion, yet the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> can proceed to such dismembering even against the will and advice of the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. In that case, however, an appeal against the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the ordinary can be lodged with the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> or the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. It is to be noted that, while very specific reasons are laid down in canon law according to which a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may divide parishes, yet our <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are not limited to such reasons. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> lays down explicitly in his Constitution "Romanos Pontifices" that our missions may be divided by the ordinaries for a greater number of reasons and for less important ones than those specified in the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>When a parish committed to regulars is to be divided, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must hear the opinion of the religious superior before taking action. A right of appeal against the dismemberment of the mission is allowed both to seculars and regulars. In case of the former, generally, the appeal is to be made to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> acts in virtue of his ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; in case of the latter, the appeal is to be laid before the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is generally using his powers of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> delegation. No appeal, however, can effect a suspension of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> mandate but only subject it to reconsideration by the higher tribunal. It is possible, however, for the ordinary to act as delegate of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for seculars as well as for regulars, exempt and non-exempt. In that case the appeal must always be made to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Parishes are sometimes formed by way of union, that is, when several parishes are joined together so as to form, either strictly or loosely, one new parish. The united parishes are simply governed by one <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> without any further change in their status (<em>unio &oelig;que principalis</em>); we have frequently a similar arrangement in English-speaking countries, where two or more churches or missions are served by one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, though otherwise independent of each other. With us, however, such union is preparatory to a division as soon as the revenues of the churches or the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> allows of it. As to union by subjection, the usual form this takes among us is when small mission stations are made (for the most part temporarily) dependent on some parish church. The power possessed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of disuniting parishes formerly joined together is frequently exercised in these countries in the above mentioned cases. As a right of patronage does not exist in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the making of new parishes is never complicated by the necessity of consulting an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> patron. The counsel, which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must take to ensure validity in the formation of new parishes, must be with his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consultors, where such a body is established, or with the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter, when the diocese possesses such a body, as in the British Isles. The regulations of ecclesiastical law by which a new parish or church must pay a certain tribute as a sign of dependence and respect to the church from which it was separated (the relation of the <em>filia</em> to the <em>ecclesia matrix</em>, or mother-church) is generally unknown in missionary countries.
<h3 id="B">Pastors or rectors of churches</h3>

<p>The rectors of missions are not canonical parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, though they have been invested with nearly all the privileges of canonical incumbents by particular <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> or decrees of <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman congregations</a>. These rectors are of two kinds, removable and irremovable. The <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> requires that every parish should have an irremovable <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, but in countries where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not canonically established, this is not always feasible, and therefore the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> permits the appointment of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> who are removable at the will of the ordinary (<em>ad nutum episcopi</em>). Priests belonging to <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, who are in charge of parishes, may be removed either by their superior or by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, without either being constrained to give the reason for his action to the other. On the removal of a regular, his religious superior nominates his successor. It is the expressed desire of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, that all rectors of parishes should, as far as possible, be endowed with the quality of perpetuity in their pastoral charge and, where this is impossible, that at least a certain number of the rectors of parishes be declared irremovable. The proportion of one out of every ten was determined on as the minimum number in American <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. When a certain rectorship has once been declared irremovable, it is not in the power of the ordinary to reduce it to the status of a removable rectorship. This is plain from the Third Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> (No. 34), as well as from the general law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which forbids <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors to lower the status or condition of churches. When a parish is declared an irremovable rectorship, the appointment of the first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> lies with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> after hearing the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consultors. For instituting all other irremovable rectors, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that a written examination or concursus be held, at which the same questions must be proposed to all the candidates. From among those whom the examiners shall deem worthy after a consideration of their answers and testimonials, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> selects one on whom he confers the parish. This rule as to a concursus does not hold, however, in all English-speaking countries. An appeal to a higher tribunal is not stopped by a concursis, for a dissatisfied candidate may lay his complaint before the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, either on account of the improper judgment of the examiners or of the unreasonable selection made by the ordinary.

<p>No examination is required for the appointment of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> to removable rectorships. When a <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> has once acquired the privilege of permanency, he cannot be removed against his will except for causes laid down by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">ecclesiastical decrees</a> or in such cases as fall under the new Constitution of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, "Maxima Cura" (20 Aug., 1910). Removable rectors, though they are appointed at the will of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, cannot be removed except for grave cause, if such removal would affect their character or their emoluments, and in case of grievance they may have recourse to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The First Synod of Westminster (D. 25) warns <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that the appointment to permanent rectorships rests with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and that no right of preferment is acquired by serving as assistant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on a mission or even administering it temporarily. On appointment to a parish, an irremovable <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> must make a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Whether the same <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> rests on removable rectors is disputed by canonists. The profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is explicitly demanded of all rectors by the First Council of Westminster, but there has been no such pronouncement in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> "Sacrorum Antistitum" (1 Sept., 1910) is, of course, binding everywhere. All <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> having <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> are bound to reside in their parishes, and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of some <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> require the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> consent for one week's absence. As our rectors are not canonical parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, they are not bound to offer up the Mass gratuitously for their people on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and holy days of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, however, this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> rests on parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, though <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> are commonly given from offering this Mass on suppressed holy days.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of instructing the young in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> is insisted on by the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and, especially in places where there are no parochial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, this instruction is to be carried on by means of Sunday <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Pastors are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to establish parochial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> where possible, and they are exhorted to visit them frequently and see to their efficient management. They are also <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to preach to their people and give them facility for approaching the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. The Westminster Synod exhorts <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> to provide missions and spiritual retreats for their flocks. As our rectors are quasi-parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, they have <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> similar to that of canonical parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> conferred on them by various councils. As regards the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> should be conferred only in the parish to which the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> belongs, and the contrary practice is strictly prohibited (II Balt., No. 227); penance cannot be administered, even to his parishioners, outside the diocese to which the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> belongs, though this would be a prerogative of a canonical parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; the Paschal Communion may be made in any public <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> or church, unless there be special legislation against it; Mass may be celebrated twice a day, with episcopal permission, when otherwise a considerable number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> would be deprived of Mass on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and holy days; matrimony is to be administered by one's own <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> for liceity; and when the contracting parties are of different parishes, it is usual for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to designate the parish of the bride as the proper place for the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. These requirements, however, do not affect the validity of the sacrament. As regards funeral <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>, there is no special legislation for the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is usually followed. The administration of the <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Viaticum</a> and extreme unction are <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> reserved to the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, and these <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> may not be infringed without penalty. Rectors of parishes are required to keep registers of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, confirmations, and interments. They are also exhorted to keep a <em>liber status animarum</em> as far as circumstances permit it. In some <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, the acceptance of a perpetual foundation for a daily or anniversary Mass is subject to the approval of the ordinary, who is to decide on the adequacy of the endowment.
<h3 id="C">Rectors and the parochial temporalities</h3>

<p>Pastors are the administrators of the parochial <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, but their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in this regard are subordinated to the episcopal authority, for the ordinary is the supreme administrator and guardian of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> temporalities of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. A financial statement of the condition of the parochial <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> must consequently be made by the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whenever he requires it. Generally, an annual statement is to be made. Whatever regulations are laid down by the ordinary for the better administration of the temporalities are binding on the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>. When lay trustees are appointed to assist in the management of the parochial <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, the rectors must obtain the episcopal consent for such appointment. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, no outlay exceeding three hundred dollars may be made by the trustees without the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> written authorization, if such outlay is for special objects other than the ordinary expenditures. The <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> must see that lay trustees clearly understand that they are in no sense owners of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> and that appropriation of it for their own use entails <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. Alienation of all <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, movable and immovable, is unlawful without the permission of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, when such <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> is of considerable value. In cases involving a sum of not more than five thousand dollars only the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> consent is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, provided he has the special faculties usually granted to American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to that effect. The penalty for unlawful alienation is <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> <em>ipso facto</em>. The <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> should make a careful inventory of all the parochial <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and file one copy in the parish archives and send another to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In cases where the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> would vest the title to <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> in lay trustees, it may be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should hold the temporalities in his own name in fee simple. It is very undesirable that the same should be done by the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>. As the rectors are the immediate custodians of the parochial <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, it is their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to keep it in proper repair. The Westminster Synods lay down clear and detailed rules in regard to the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of rectors concerning <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. "Whoever is set over the administration of a mission . . . should keep a day-book of all the receipts and expenses of the mission, both of which should be entered most accurately every day in their proper order. He should also keep a ledger to which he will transfer, every month or three months, all the entries in the other book arranged in order, according to the heads under which each sum received or expended ought to be placed." "Every administrator should keep an open account in some bank in his own name and in the names of two honest <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Let these <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are taken only to prevent the money from any peril of loss and that they must not interfere in the administration. If one fail from any cause the two who remain shall take care to have another elected by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to supply the place. The administrator should never keep for longer than ten days on hand more than 201. of money belonging to the mission . . . but he should diligently place it in the bank." "All buildings belonging to a mission should be insured against fire by an annual payment to some <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for this purpose." "As soon as any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> enters on his mission let him receive an inventory of all things belonging to the mission from the vicar forane or from some one deputed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He is bound to keep the furniture and buildings in good repair, yea, rather to improve them, that he may deliver to his successors as much, at least, as he received himself." "In every mission, the money contributed by the faithful (for seat rents, offertories, house to house collections and special collections) . . . is to be accounted <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> and not as gifts given to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>." &#151; By the Constitution "Romanos Pontifices", regulars administering missions must render an account to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of all money given to them with a view to the mission.
