<h1>Parochial Registers</h1>  

<p>One having the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> is commanded by Divine precept to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his subjects (Conc. Trid., sess. XXIII, c. i, "De Ref."). The better to fulfill this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, and because, moreover, of the historical importance and probatory force of public records, a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> must have five distinct <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> registers: one each of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, confirmations, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, and deaths; and a fifth containing a census or general account of the state of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. Definite forms for entries in these books are prescribed by the Ritual. Every public document should bear the place, date, and nature of the act inscribed, the name of the one officiating, the names of the parties concerned and the witnesses present, and the signature of the proper official. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> prescribes that in her <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> registers all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> be designated not only by name, but likewise by parentage and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>; that the office, e.g. <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a>, of the one officiating be mentioned; that the record be complete, i.e. giving every <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> detail to remove all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> and uncertainty regarding the validity of the act in question, or the observance of prescribed formalities.

<p>A <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> registry, consequently, will also record the fact of legitimacy, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth, and name or names imposed. If the sacrament is conferred privately, conditionally, or the ceremonies are merely supplied, such should appear in the record. The entry will show when, where, and by whom a foundling was discovered, and the age, presumably, of the child. The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of one born out of wedlock is recorded with the name of either known (not reputed) parent. In no public register however is any derogatory or defamatory note allowed. To safeguard reputation, records at times, particularly of certain <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, are preserved in a secret register. A new feature ("Ne temere", can. ix, &#167; 2) in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> records is a marginal note of the subsequent marriage of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Future legislation may make this <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> also, when one receives <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a> or enters religion.

<p>In the registration of confirmation, as well as of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, sponsors are to be carefully noted, owing to the spiritual relationship which arises. A matrimonial record should state whether the <a href="../cathen/02255a.htm">banns</a> were published; what <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, if any, was obtained and applied; that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> officiating was duly delegated, if such be the case; that the consent of the parties was asked and given ("Ne temere", can. iv, &#167; 3). If later a recorded marriage is declared null by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or, having been found to be invalid, has been rendered valid in the external forum, a marginal note, duly attested, will contain this information. Death records state what <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> the deceased received in preparation for death, by whom they were administered, and place of burial. Lastly, an official registration of all parishioners is kept, giving name, <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, age, residence, whether they have made their First Communion, been confirmed, made their <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, etc.

<p>All entries in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> registers are to be made in Latin and by the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, even though he may not have officiated. Practice however tolerates in the vernacular records of deaths (Conc. Balt. Plen., II, n. 233) and of the general state of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. To the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> belongs the custody of these books; every possible care must be taken to preserve them from destruction, injury, or falsification. These records are public instruments, and as such constitute perfect <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the fact, which they record. Such <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> would naturally be sought in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>; <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> registers consequently should record <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, etc. of parishioners, though the event chronicled take place elsewhere.
