<h1>Particular Judgment</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Dogma of particular judgment</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> of the particular judgment is this: that <em>immediately after death the eternal destiny of each separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is decided by the just judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</em> Although there has been no formal definition on this point, the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> is clearly implied in the Union <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> (1439), which declares that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> leaving their bodies in a state of grace, but in need of purification are cleansed in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">Purgatory</a>, whereas <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that are perfectly pure are at once admitted to the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Godhead</a> (<em>ipsum Deum unum et trinum</em>) and those who depart in actual mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or merely with <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, are at once consigned to eternal punishment, the quality of which corresponds to their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (<em>paenis tamen disparibus</em>). The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is also in the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Michael Palaeologus in 1274, in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Benedictus Deus" of <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a>, in 1336, and in the professions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>.
<h2 id="section2">Existence of particular judgment proved from Scripture</h2>

<p>Ecclesiastes 11:9; 12:1 sq.; and Hebrews 9:27, are sometimes quoted in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the particular judgment, but though these passages speak of a judgment after death, neither the context nor the force of the words proves that the sacred writer had in mind a judgment distinct from that at the end of the world. The Scriptural arguments in defence of the particular judgment must be indirect. There is no text of which we can certainly say that it expressly affirms this <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> but there are several which teach an immediate retribution after death and thereby clearly imply a particular judgment. Christ represents Lazarus and Dives as receiving their respective rewards immediately after death. They have always been regarded as types of the just man and the sinner. To the penitent thief it was promised that his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> instantly on leaving the body would be in the state of the blessed: "This day thou shalt be with me in <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a>" (<a href="../bible/luk023.htm#vrs43">Luke 23:43</a>). <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/2co005.htm">2 Corinthians 5</a>) longs to be absent from the body that he may be present to the Lord, evidently understanding death to be the entrance into his reward (cf. <a href="../bible/phm001.htm#vrs21">Philemon 1:21 sq.</a>). Ecclesiasticus 11:28-29 speaks of a retribution at the hour of death, but it may refer to a temporal punishment, such as sudden death in the midst of prosperity, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> remembrance that survives the wicked or the misfortunes of their children. However, the other texts that have been quoted are sufficient to establish the strict conformity of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> with Scripture teaching. (Cf. <a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs25">Acts 1:25</a>; <a href="../bible/rev020.htm#vrs4">Apocalypse 20:4-6</a>, <a href="../bible/rev012.htm">12</a>-<a href="../bible/rev014.htm">14</a>)
<h2 id="section3">Patristic testimony regarding particular judgment</h2>

<p>St. Augustine witnesses clearly and emphatically to this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the early Church. Writing to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Peter, he criticizes the works of Vincentius Victor on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, pointing out that they contain nothing except what is vain or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> or mere commonplace, familiar to all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. As an instance of the last, he cites Victor's interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of Lazarus and Dives. He writes: <blockquote>

<p>For with respect to that which he (Victor] most correctly and very soundly holds, namely, that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are judged when they depart from the body, before they come to that judgment which must be passed on them when reunited to the body and are tormented or glorified in that same flesh which they here inhabited &#151; was that a matter of which you (Peter) were unaware? Who is so obstinate against the Gospel as not to perceive those things in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of that poor man carried after death to <a href="../cathen/01055a.htm">Abraham's bosom</a> and of the rich man whose torments are set before us? (De anima et ejus origine, 11, n.8.)</blockquote>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> of the Fathers occur graphic descriptions of the particular judgment (cf. S. Ephraem, "Sermo de secundo Adventu"; "Sermo in eos qui in Christo obdormiunt").
<h2 id="section4">Heresies</h2>

<p>Lactantius is one of the few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers who disputed this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> <a href="../fathers/07017.htm#21">(<em>Divine Institutes</em> VII:21)</a>. Among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> the particular judgment was denied by <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a> and Vigilantius. The Hypnopsychites and the Thnetopsychites believed that at death the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> passed away, according to the former into a state of unconsciousness, according to the latter into temporary destruction. They believed that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> would arise at the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the body</a> for judgment. This theory of "soul slumber" was defended by the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> and <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a>, and later by the <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptists</a>, <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01740c.htm">Arminians</a>. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> (Inst. III, 25) holds that the final destiny is not decided till the last day.
<h2 id="section5">Prompt fulfilment of sentence</h2>

<p>The prompt fulfilment of the sentence is part of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of particular judgment, but until the question was settled by the decision of <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a>, in 1332, there was much uncertainty regarding the fate of the departed in the period between death and the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">general resurrection</a>. There was never any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the penalty of loss (<em>poena damni</em>), the temporal or eternal forfeiture of the joys of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, began from the moment of death. Likewise it was admitted from the earliest times that the punishment following death included other sufferings (<em>poena sensus</em>) than the penalty of loss (<a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a>, <a href="../fathers/01281.htm"><em>Dialogue with Trypho</em> 5</a>). But whether the torment of fire was to be included among these sufferings, or whether it began only after the final judgment, was a question that gave rise to many divergent opinions. It was a common <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> among the early Fathers that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devils</a> will not suffer from the flames of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> until the end of the world. Regarding the reprobate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> there was a similar <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. Some of the Fathers contended that these <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> do not suffer the torment of fire until reunited with their bodies in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, while others hesitated (cf. Tert., "De Test. an.", iv). Many, on the contrary, clearly taught that the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell fire</a> followed speedily upon the particular judgment (Hilary, In Ps. cxxxviii, 22). This is evident from the words of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a>: "just as <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> rejoices the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, so it must be believed that from the day of their death fire burns the reprobate" (Dial., IV, 28). <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Early Christian writers</a> also refer to a <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatorial fire</a> in which <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> not perfectly just are purified after death.

<p>Some of the early Fathers, misled by Millennarian <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, believed that the essential beatitude of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> is not enjoyed until the end of time. They supposed that during the interval between death and the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just dwell happily in a delightful abode, awaiting their final glorification. This was apparently the opinion of Sts. <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> and <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">St. Clement of Alexandria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>. According to others, only the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and some other classes of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are admitted at once to the supreme joys of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. It cannot, however, be inferred from these passages that all of the Fathers quoted believed that the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a> is in most cases delayed till the day of judgment. Many of them in other parts of their works profess the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> either expressly or by implication through the acknowledgment of other <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> in which it is contained, for instance, in that of the descent of Christ into Limbo, an article of the Creed which loses all significance unless it be admitted that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> were thereby liberated from this temporal penalty of loss and admitted to the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>. As to the passages which state that the supreme <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> is not enjoyed till after the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>, they refer in many instances to an increase in the accidental <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the blessed through the union of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with its glorified body, and do not signify that the essential <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is not enjoyed till then. Notwithstanding the aberrations of some writers and the hesitation of others, the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that since the death of Christ <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which are free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> enter at once into the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a> was always firmly held by the great body of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, De exhort. mart.). As the earliest Acts of the Martyrs and Liturgies attest, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were persuaded of the prompt reward of their devotion. This <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is also evidenced by the ancient practice of honouring and invoking the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, even those who were not <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. But the opposite <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> found adherents from time to time, and in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was warmly defended. The <a href="../cathen/09476c.htm">Second Council of Lyons</a> (1274) declared that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are at once received into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> (<em>mox in caelum recipi</em>), but did not decide in what their state of beatitude consisted. A number of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> maintained the opinion that until the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> the just do not enjoy the <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuitive</a> or facial <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>, but are under the protection and consolation of the Humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> (1316-1334) at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, as a private <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, seems to have supported this view, but that he gave it any official sanction is a fable invented by the Fallibilists. His successor, <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a>, ended the controversy by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Benedictus Deus".
<h2 id="section6">Circumstances of particular judgment according to theologians</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> suppose that the particular judgment will be instantaneous, that in the moment of death the separated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is internally illuminated as to its own guilt or innocence and of its own initiation takes its course either to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, or to <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, or to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> (Summa Theologica Supplement 69:2, 88:2). In confirmation of this opinion the text of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> is cited: "Who shew the work of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> written in their hearts, their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> bearing witness to them, and their thoughts between themselves accusing, or also defending one another, in the day when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall judge the secrets of men by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/rom002.htm#vrs15">Romans 2:15-16</a>). The "Book of Judgment", in which all the deeds of men are written (<a href="../bible/rev020.htm#vrs12">Apocalypse 20:12</a>), and the appearance of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and demons to bear witness before the judgment seat are regarded as allegorical descriptions (St. Augustine, <a href="../fathers/120120.htm"><em>City of God</em> XX.14</a>). The common opinion is that the particular judgment will occur at the place of death (Suarez in III, Q, lix. a. 6, disp. 52).
