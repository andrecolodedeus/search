<h1>Paschal Tide</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Liturgical aspect</h2>

<p>The fifty days from <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a> to <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">Pentecost</a> are called by the older <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgists</a> "Quinquagesima paschalis" or "Quin. laetitiae". The octave of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> which closer after Saturday has its own peculiar Office. Since this octave is part and complement of the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Solemnity</a>. Paschal Tide in the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> commences with the First <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> of <a href="../cathen/09400a.htm">Low Sunday</a> and ends before the First <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> of <a href="../cathen/15058a.htm">Trinity Sunday</a>. On <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a> the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> Church keeps the Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed and on Saturday of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Week</a> the Decollation of St. John. The <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> on Friday of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Week</a> celebrates the feast of Our Lady, the Living Fountain (shrine at Constantinople).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> from <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> to <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension Day</a>, besides being called the First, Second (etc.) Sunday after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, have their own peculiar titles. <ul> <li>The first is the "Dominica in albis", or <a href="../cathen/09400a.htm">Low Sunday</a>. In the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> (also in the province of St. Louis, Mo.) on the Monday after <a href="../cathen/09400a.htm">Low Sunday</a> is celebrated the feast of the Joys or Exultation of Mary at the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> of her <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Son</a> (double of the second class). The <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a>, on Tuesday of this week, go in procession to the cemeteries and place <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> eggs on the graves [Maltzew, "Fasten-und Blumen-Triodion" (Berlin, 1899), 791]. <li>In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> the second <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> is called from its Gospel the Sunday of the Good Shepherd and from the <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a> "Misericordias Domini"; in many <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> (Seville, <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>) it is called the feast of Our Lady Mother of the Good Shepherd (d. 2nd cl.); at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and in the churches of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> it is called the feast of the Holy Sepulchre of Christ; in the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> it is called <em>ion myrophoron</em> (Sunday of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who brought ointments to the sepulchre of Christ); the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> celebrate on this Sunday the dedication of the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> church on Mount Sion. <li>The third <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> is called from the <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a> <a href="../cathen/08531b.htm">"Jubilate"</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> has assigned to it the feast of the Patronage of St. Joseph (d. 2nd cl.); the Greeks call it the Sunday of the Paralytic, from its Gospel. The <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a> on Wednesday after the third <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> celebrate with a very solemn Office and an octave the <em>Mesopentekoste</em>, the completion of the first half of Paschal Tide; it is the feast of the manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messiah</a>, the victory of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> over <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> ["Zeitschrift f&uuml;r katholische Theologie" (1895), 169-177]; the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> nations in this day have a solemn procession and benediction of their rivers (<a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, "Kal." II, 361). <li>The fourth <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> is called <a href="../cathen/03299a.htm">"Cantate"</a>; by the Orientals it is called Sunday of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> Woman. <li>The fifth Sunday, "Vocem jucunditatis" in the Orient, Sunday of the Man Born Blind. In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> follow the <a href="../cathen/13110b.htm">Rogation Days</a>; in the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> on Tuesday is kept the <em>apodosis</em> or conclusion of the feast of Easter. The Greeks sing the Canons of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> up to this Tuesday in the same manner as during <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Week</a>, whilst in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> the specific <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Office terminates on Saturday following the feast. Thursday is the <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">feast of the Ascension</a>. The Friday of this week, in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, is called "Witterfreitag"; the fields are blessed against frost and thunderstorms. <li>Sunday within the octave of <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension</a> is called "Exaudi" from the <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a>; in some <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> it is called Feast of Our Lady, Queen of the Apostles (double major) or of the Cenacle (Charleston and Savannah, first class); in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> it was called Sunday of the Roses ("Pascha rosarum" or "rosatum"), since in the Pantheon rose-leaves were thrown from the rotunda into the church; in the Greek and Russian Churches it is the feast of the 318 Fathers of the first Nicene Council; the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> call it the "second <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the flowers", a repetition of <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>. By older <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgists</a> the week before Pentecost is called "Hebdomada expectationis", week of the expectation of the Holy Ghost. On the Vigil of Pentecost the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> water is blessed in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>; in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a> it this Saturday is the <em>psychosabbaton</em> (All Soul's Day); on this day the Greeks <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> wheat cakes and have processions to the cemeteries.</ul> Paschal Tide is a season of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. The colour for the Office <em>de tempore</em> is white; the <a href="../cathen/14468c.htm">Te Deum</a> and Gloria are recited every day even in the <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferial</a> Office. On <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> the "Asperges" is replaced by the "Vidi Aquam" which recalls the solemn <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Easter eve</a>. There is no <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> from <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> until <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> during this period do away even with the abstinence on Fridays. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayers</a> are said standing, not kneeling. Instead of the "Angelus" the "Regina Caeli" is recited. From <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> to <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension</a> many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, about the tenth century, said only one <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturn</a> at <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>; even some particular churches in the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> adopted this custom from the Teutons (B&auml;umer, "Gesch. des Breviers", 312). <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> limited this privilege to the week of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> and of Pentecost. Some <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> however, retained it far into the nineteenth century for 40 days after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. In every <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturn</a> the three psalms are said under one antiphon. The <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a> appears as an independent antiphon; an <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a> is also added to all the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, responsories, and versicles, except to the versicles of the <em>preces</em> at Prime and <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a>. Instead of the "suffragia sanctorum" in the semidouble and <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferial</a> Offices a commemoration of the Holy Cross is used. The iambic <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> have a special <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> <a href="../cathen/05150a.htm">doxology</a>. The feasts of the holy Apostles and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> have their own <em>commune</em> from <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> to Pentecost. At Mass the <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a> is added to the <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a>, <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> and Communion; in place of the Gradual two <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluias</a> are sung followed by two verses, each with an <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>; there is also a special Preface for Paschal Time.
<h2 id="section2">In canon law</h2>

<p>Paschal Tide is the period during which every member of the faithful who has attained the year of discretion is bound by the positive law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> (Easter <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>). During the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> from the time of the <a href="../cathen/01206b.htm">Synod of Agde</a> (508), it was customary to receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> at least three times a year &#151; <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and Pentecost. A positive precept was issued by the <a href="../cathen/09018a.htm">Fourth Lateran Council</a> (1215) and confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XIII, can. ix). According to these decrees the faithful of either sex, after coming to the age of discretion, must receive at least at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Sacrament of the Eucharist</a> (unless by the advice of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> they abstain for a while). Otherwise during life they are to be prevented from entering the church and when dead are to be denied <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">Christian burial</a>. The paschal precept is to be fulfilled in one's <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church. Although the precept of the Fourth Lateran to confess to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> fell into disuse and permission was given to confess anywhere, the precept of receiving Easter Communion in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church is still in force where there are canonically-erected <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. The term Paschal Tide was usually interpreted to mean the two weeks between <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm</a> and <a href="../cathen/09400a.htm">Low Sundays</a> (Synod of Avignon, 1337); by St. Antonine of Florence it was restricted to <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Sunday, Monday and Tuesday by Angelo da Chiavasso it was defined as the period from <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a> to <a href="../cathen/09400a.htm">Low Sunday</a>. <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>, 8 July, 1440, authoritatively interpreted it to mean the two weeks between <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm</a> and <a href="../cathen/09400a.htm">Low Sundays</a> [G. Allmang, "K&ouml;lner Pastoralblatt" (Nov., 1910) 327 sq.]. In later centuries the time has been variously extended: at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> from <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a> to <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension</a>; at Palermo from <a href="../cathen/01775b.htm">Ash Wednesday</a> to <a href="../cathen/09400a.htm">Low Sunday</a>. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, at an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, the second <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> terminated Paschal Tide, for which reason it was called "Predigerkirchweih", because the hard <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> labour was over, or "Buch Sunday", the obstinate sinners putting off the fulfillment of the precept to the last day. In the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> upon petition of the Fathers of the First <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> Paschal Tide was extended by <a href="../cathen/12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a> to the period from the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> to <a href="../cathen/15058a.htm">Trinity Sunday</a> (II Plen. Coun. Balt., n. 257); in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> it lasts from <a href="../cathen/01775b.htm">Ash Wednesday</a> until <a href="../cathen/09400a.htm">Low Sunday</a>; in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> from <a href="../cathen/01775b.htm">Ash Wednesday</a> until the octave of SS. Peter and Paul, 6 July (O'Kane "Rubrics of the Roman Ritual", n. 737; Slater, "Moral Theology" 578, 599); in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> the duration of the Paschal Tide is the same as in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.
