<h1>Pasquier Quesnel</h1>  

<p>(PASCHASE)

<p>Pasquier Quesnel, born in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 14 July, 1634; died at <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>, 2 December, 1719. Descended from an ancient noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> he completed at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a> a brilliant course in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. At the age of twenty-three he entered the congregation of the Oratory where his talents were profitably employed in the direction of the young. He composed for the use of the students under his charge, and published in 1671 an "Epitome of the Morals of the Evangelists, or Christian Thoughts on the Texts of the Four Evangelists". By important successive developments, this work became "The New Testament in French with Moral Reflections on each verse" (Paris, 1687-92) and gave rise to lively polemics until at last, in 1708, his doctrines were condemned by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> (see <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">JANSENIUS</a>). But the edition of 1671 already contained five of the 101 propositions (12, 13, 30, 60, and 65) later censured in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>. Quesnel was profoundly imbued with the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, and he had skilfully spread these views in his "Moral Reflections" on the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Furthermore, he had adopted, in relation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, the teachings of Marco Antonio de Dominis and of Richer. He published (Paris, 1675; Lyons, 1700) a complete edition of the works of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo the Great</a>. The notes and dissertations which he added, though very learned, are spoiled by his attacks upon <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a>, and even Roman primacy. In consequence, this work was placed under the ban of the Index, and Quesnel's only reply to the condemnation was disrespectful recrimination. On account of his <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> opinions, which he emphasized more and more he was relegated to Orl&eacute;ans. In 1684, having refused to subscribe to the formula which the General Assembly of the Oratory felt <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to draw up against the current <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, he was compelled to quit the congregation. He then went to <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> to join Antoine* Arnauld, at whose death (1694) he was present, and whose place he took at the head of the party.

<p>The difficulties of a sojourn in a foreign land failed to dampen his ardour for proselytizing or abate his literary activity. The dictionary of Moreri attributes to him some sixty discourses, ascetic or polemical, several of which were published under assumed names or anonymously at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, where for some time he remained in hiding. But in 1703 Philip V, acting in concert with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, Humbert of Precipiano, had him arrested and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace. Nevertheless, he succeeded in escaping and reaching <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, finding an asylum at <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>, where he continued, despite all bans and censures, to write in support of his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Obstinate in the pursuit of his aims, he was not always delicate in his choice of means. When the royal commissioners discovered him disguised in secular dress and crouching behind a cask, and wished to assure themselves of his identity, he declared that his name was Rebecq, one of his numerous pseudonyms. On the part of a man who like all those of his party scorned <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> restrictions and equivocations, the expedient, to say the least, was singular. Still more disloyal was his attempt to cloak his doctrines with the authority of <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>. The latter had been requested to examine the text of the "R&eacute;flexions morales" and had consented to do so. He had even drawn up an advertisement as a preface to a new edition, insisting, however, on the correction of one hundred and twenty propositions which he had found reprehensible. As this condition was not accepted, he refused his co-operation and held back his proposed "Avertissement". But later on Quesnel obtained from the heirs of <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> the materials which the latter had prepared, and which he published as an authentic work under the title "Justification of the Moral Reflections, by the late M. Bossuet". Up to the time of his death the ardent <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> was inconsistent and insincere. He requested and received the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and in presence of two Apostolic prothonotaries and other witnesses, he made a profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> over his own signature, in which he declared "that he wished to die, as he had always lived, in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that he believed all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> taught by her, condemned all the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> condemned by her, that he recognized the Sovereign Pontiff as the chief Vicar of Jesus Christ, and the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> as the centre of unity". That these formulas concealed some inadmissible restrictions is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by their very tenor. On this point we are left in no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in view of Article 7 which completes them, and in which it is said the writer "persists in his appeal to a future General Council, regarding the constitution 'Unigenitus', and regarding the grievances <em>&agrave; propos</em> of which he sought the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>" .

<p>Among the numerous works of Quesnel besides those already mentioned we may cite especially: "Lettres contre les nudit&eacute;s address&eacute;es aux religieuses qui ont soin de l'&eacute;ducation des filles"; "L'Id&eacute;e du Sacerdoce et du Sacrifice de J&eacute;sus Christ"; "Les trois cons&eacute;crations: la cons&eacute;cration baptismale, la sacerdotale et la cons&eacute;cration religieuse"; "El&eacute;vation &agrave; N. S.J. C. sur sa Passion et sa Mort"; "J&eacute;sus p&eacute;nitent"; "Du bonheur de la mort chr&eacute;tienne"; "Pri&egrave;res chr&eacute;tiennes avec des pratiques de pi&eacute;t&eacute;"; "Office de J&eacute;sus avec des r&eacute;flexions"; "Recueil de lettres spirituelles sur divers sujets de la morale et de la pi&eacute;t&eacute;"; under the pseudonym of G&eacute;ry, "Apologie historique de deux censures (contre Lessius) de l'Universit&eacute; de Douai"; under the pseudonym of Germain, "Tradition de l'&Eacute;glise Romaine sur la pr&eacute;destination des saints et sur la gr&acirc;ce efficace"; "La discipline de l'&Eacute;glise tir&eacute;e du Nouveau Testament et de quelques anciens conciles"; "Causa Arnaldina", a work produced under another form as "La justification de M. Arnauld"; "Entretiens sur le D&eacute;cret de Rome contre le Nouveau Testament de Ch&acirc;lons accompagn&eacute;es de reflexions morales"; finally seven "M&eacute;moires" serving as a history of the constitution <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>. This list, however incomplete, comprises in its first part only the most generally useful and edifying works; as an offset the seven last numbers are either impregnated with the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> principles or <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> principally to their defence.


<h2>Quesnellism</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Quesnel found their most complete expression in his "R&eacute;flexions morales". Although they appear there only on occasions, disjointedly, in a fragmentary way, and are moreover hidden in the expression of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> considerations, they really form a systematic whole; they show their author to have adopted a radically <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> but coherent system, which is fundamentally only a synthesis of the systems of <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a> and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>. To make this clear, one has only to compare the hundred and one propositions condemned in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>, and faithfully extracted from the "R&eacute;flexions morales" with the theories previously defended by the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Bishop of Ypres</a> and his predecessor in the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>. For Quesnel, like <a href="../cathen/02209c.htm">Baius</a>, conceived <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in its three successive states: innocence, fall, and restoration. All his essential theses are based on a confusion between the natural and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>, which necessarily entailed the assertion of an intrinsic difference in regard to gratuity as well as to efficacy, between the grace of the Creator and the grace of the Redeemer. "The grace of Adam produced only human merits" (prop. 34); but "being a consequence of the creation, it was due to nature when whole and unimpaired" (prop. 35). Its loss through the original fall mutilated our nature, and man having become "a sinner is, without the grace of the Liberator, free only to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>" (prop. 38). Moreover, this grace "is never given except by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" (prop. 26). Faith which "is the first grace and the source of all the others" (prop. 27), is to be understood as "operative <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and it works only by charity" (prop. 51). Consequently "outside of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> no grace is given" (prop. 29), and "the first grace given to the sinner being the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" (prop. 28), all his acts, as long as he remains a sinner, are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (prop. 44-8), so that "the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the wicked is a new <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grants to them is a fresh condemnation" (prop. 59).

<p>This is all resumed in the thesis of the double contrary <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: "There are only two loves, from which all our volitions and all our actions spring: the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (charity properly so called) which refers everything to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> rewards; and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of self and of the world, which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as it does not refer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> what should be referred to Him" (prop. 44). From this follow not only the uselessness, but the malice and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> effects of attrition, that is, of all repentance which does not arise from pure charity; for, "fear restrains only the hands; the heart remains attached to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as long as it is not led by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>" (prop. 61); and "he who refrains from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> only through fear of punishment has already <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in his heart" (prop. 62). Thus, the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> conception of the really gratuitous and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character of the original grace bore its legitimate fruits, rigorism and despair; it resulted, as far as concerns attrition, in a conclusion already condemned by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. In Quesnel we find likewise the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the "Augustinus" (see <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">JANSENIUS</a>). Like that famous book, the "R&eacute;flexions Morales" did not admit either purely sufficient grace or real liberty of indifference; on the contrary, it denied them in many formulas "Grace is the operation of the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which nothing can hinder or retard" (prop. 10), "it is nothing but the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who commands and who executes his commands" (prop. 11). "When <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, no matter when or where, wishes to save a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is infallibly carried into effect" (prop. 12). "When <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wills to save a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and touches it with the interior hand of his grace, no human will can resist it" (prop. 13); "there is no attraction but yields to the attraction of grace, because nothing resists the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">Omnipotent</a>" (prop. 16). In a word, the action of grace can and must be likened to that by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> created the world, realized the Incarnation, raised <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> from the dead, and by which He worked every other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> (prop. 20-5).

<p>Having admitted all this, it is not astonishing that the Divine <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> cannot be observed by men of good will who make the effort. For, on the one hand, "the grace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the efficacious principle of all good, is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for any good work whatsoever; without it not only is nothing done but nothing can be done" (prop. 2); "the will without prevenient grace has no light save to go wrong, no <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> but to hasten to destruction, no strength but to wound itself: it is capable of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and incapable of any good" (prop. 39). On the other hand, when grace is present and acting one never resists it. If therefore anyone fail in his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, it can only be because he has not received the indispensable grace. For "grace is that voice of the Father teaching men interiorly and leading them to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; whoever, having heard the exterior voice of the Son, does not come to him, has not been taught by the Father" (prop. 17). And yet, according to Quesnel, man will be held guilty and condemned for those transgressions which he cannot possibly avoid (prop. 40). But, since the observing of commandments and therefore of the conditions <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is not within the reach of all, it is evident that neither the intention of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to save nor the efficacy of the sufferings of the Saviour extend to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. So "all those whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wishes to save through Christ are infallibly saved" (prop. 30), and if "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself delivered Himself up to death", it was solely "to snatch the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>, that is the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, from the hand of the exterminating <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>" (prop. 32).

<p>All these extraordinary <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of Quesnel's concerning grace, and his obstinate defence of them against legitimate authority had, as a practical and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> result, a second group of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> no less serious about the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, its membership, discipline, and government in general. According to Quesnel, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is invisible; for it comprises "as members only the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>" or "the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> and the just" (prop. 72-7), and "a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is separated from it by not living according to the Gospel as much as by not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in the Gospel" (prop. 78). It is an abuse in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> "to forbid <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to read the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and especially the Gospel" (prop. 85), for this reading "is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to all, in every place and at all times" (prop. 79-84). "It is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that has the power of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicating</a>, to be used by the chief <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> with the consent, at least presumed, of the whole body" (prop. 90). This, as the author states explicitly in his seventh "M&eacute;moire", supposes that the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, without distinction of rank, is properly speaking the sole depository of all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> power; but, as it cannot exercise this power by itself, the community entrusts it to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who are its agents and its mandatories; and, in this sense, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is only "the ministerial head" of the episcopal body. Moreover, "the fear of an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> must never keep us from doing our <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>" (prop. 91), "to suffer in peace an undeserved <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> rather than betray the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is to imitate <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>" (prop. 92). The directly personal character and object of these last declarations are apparent. The same may be said of the articles that protest against the abuse of multiplying <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (prop. 101), or speak of the contempt, intolerance, and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> to which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is subjected (prop. 93-100), and which, crowning this sad arraignment with an assertion more offensive than the others, see in the abuses pretended to have been discovered "one of the most striking <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the senile decay of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>" (prop. 95).
