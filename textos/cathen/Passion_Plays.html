<h1>Passion Plays</h1>  

<p>The modern drama does not originate in the ancient, but in the <a href="../cathen/10348a.htm">religious plays</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, themselves an outcome of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Ecclesiastical worship</a> was thoroughly dramatic, particularly the <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Holy Mass</a>, with its progressive action, its dialogue between the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and their <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> at the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, or, on <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feastdays</a>, between the officiating <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and his assistants, with the <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir of singers</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">people</a>. Often &#151; e.g. at <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, <a href="../cathen/05504c.htm">Epiphany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> &#151; the text of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> called for a variety of r&ocirc;les. The celebration of the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feasts</a> was as rich and varied as they were numerous; poetry and <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">music</a>, in particular, helped to impress properly on the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> the full significance of the great events commemorated. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of <a href="../cathen/06347a.htm">St. Gall</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, in the tenth century wrote <a href="../cathen/12481d.htm">sequences</a>, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15065a.htm">tropes</a> and set them to <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">music</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15065a.htm">tropes</a> &#151; elaborations of parts of the <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Liturgy</a>, particularly the <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a>, fine <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">musical</a> settings &#151; found universal acceptance and remained in use in various forms until the end of the seventeenth century. These <a href="../cathen/15065a.htm">tropes</a> were dramatic in construction and, as their <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">musical</a> settings prove, were sung alternately by two <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choirs</a> of men and boys, or by two halfchoirs. The history of the <a href="../cathen/10348a.htm">ecclesiastical drama</a> begins with the <a href="../cathen/15065a.htm">trope</a> sung as <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit of the Mass</a> on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a>. It has come down to us in a <a href="../cathen/06347a.htm">St. Gall</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> dating from the time of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Tutilo (tenth century).

<p>The conversation held between the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> at the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre of our Lord</a> forms the text of this <a href="../cathen/15065a.htm">trope</a>, which is comprised in the four sentences:

<blockquote><p>Quem qu&aelig;ritis in sepulchro, o christicol&aelig;
<br>Jesum Nazarenum, o c&oelig;licol&aelig;
<br>Non est hic. Surrexit, sicut pr&aelig;dixerat.
<br>Ite nuntiate quia surrexit de sepulchro.
<br>Resurrexi, postquam factus homo, tua jussa paterna peregi."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The first three sentences are found in many <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> dating from the tenth to the eighteenth century. The <a href="../cathen/15065a.htm">trope</a>, however, did not develop into a dramatic scene, until it was brought into connection with the Descent from the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">Cross</a>, widely commemorated in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Continental</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, but which appears first in a <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Ritual</a> of <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">English</a> origin, attributed to <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">St. Dunstan</a> (967). In giving directions for public services, the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Ritual</a> refers to this custom particularly as observed at <a href="../cathen/06102c.htm">Fleury-sur-Loire</a> and <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>. On <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, after the morning services, a <a href="../cathen/04533a.htm">crucifix</a> swathed in cloth was laid in a sort of grave arranged near the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>, where it remained until <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> morning. On <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> morning, after the third <a href="../cathen/12787a.htm">responsory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a>, one or two <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> clothed in <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">albs</a>, and carrying palms in their hands, went to the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">grave</a> and seated themselves there. Thereupon three other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vested</a> in <a href="../cathen/04351a.htm">copes</a>, and carrying <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censers</a> representing the three <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, joined them. Upon their arrival the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> asked them: "Whom seek ye?" The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> answered; they hear from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> the message of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> and were told to go forth and announce it. Then they intoned the <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphon</a>: "Surrexit enim, sicut dixit dominus. <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>". The <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> finished <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> with the <a href="../cathen/14468c.htm">"Te Deum"</a>.

<p>This simplest form of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> celebration was elaborated in many ways by the addition of <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Biblical</a> sentences, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12481d.htm">sequences</a>, in particular the <a href="../cathen/15407a.htm">"Victim&aelig; paschali"</a>, which dates from the first half of the eleventh century; also by the representation of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John</a> running to the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">grave</a>, and by the appearance of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, who thenceforth becomes the central figure. The union of these scenes in one concerted action (the dialogue), rendered in poetic form (<a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, <a href="../cathen/12481d.htm">sequences</a>) or in prose (<a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Bible</a> texts), and the participation of a <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> gave to the <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> celebration of the thirteenth century the character of a short <a href="../cathen/12144a.htm">chanted</a> drama. Such celebrations, however, remained parts of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a> as late as the eighteenth century. They were inserted between <a href="../cathen/10050a.htm">Matins</a> and <a href="../cathen/09038a.htm">Lauds</a>, and served for the instruction of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">people</a>, whose hearts and minds were more deeply impressed by reproductions of the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of the Lord</a>, which appealed to the senses, than by a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermon</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> text was no obstacle, since the separate parts of the plays were known or were previously explained. The wide diffusion of these <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> plays, in which <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> took the different parts, is proof of their popularity. Lange, to whom we owe some thorough studies on this subject, proves the existence of 224 <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> dramas, of which 159 were found in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, 52 in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and the rest in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">England</a>.

<p>The popular taste for <a href="../cathen/10348a.htm">dramatic productions</a> was fed by these <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> celebrations. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> emphasized more and more the dramatic moments, often merely hinted at in the rude original celebrations, and added new subjects, among them some of a secular nature. They introduced the characters of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a>, and the soldiers guarding the <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">sepulchre</a>, added the figure of an ointment-vender bargaining with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and other features which did not contribute to the edification or instruction of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">people</a>, though they satisfied their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of novelty and amusement. In this way the early <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> celebrations became real <a href="../cathen/10348a.htm">dramatic performances</a>, known as the Easter Plays. Since the element of worldly amusement predominated more and more (a development of which <a href="../cathen/06472a.htm">Gerhoh of Reichersberg</a> complained as early as the twelfth century), the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> began to prohibit the production of Easter Plays in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>. It became necessary to separate them from church services, because of their length, which increased greatly, particularly after the introduction of the story of the <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">Passion</a>. Fragments of an Easter Play in <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> dating from the thirteenth century are found in the <a href="../cathen/02441a.htm">Benedictbeurn</a> Easter Play, also in that of Klosterneuburg, both of which, probably, go back to the same source as the <a href="../cathen/10348a.htm">Mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, composed as late as the twelfth century, and which, better than any other, offers an insight into the development of the Easter Plays from the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> celebrations.

<p>When, in course of time, as shown in the Easter Play of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German</a> translations were added to the original texts as sung and spoken, the popularizing of the Easter Play had begun. That of the <a href="../cathen/10643a.htm">monastery of Muri</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, belongs to this period, and is written entirely in <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German</a>. But it was only after the popular element had asserted itself strongly in all departments of poetry, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, that the popular <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German</a> <a href="../cathen/10348a.htm">religious drama</a> was developed. This was brought about chiefly by the strolling players who were certainly responsible for the introduction of the servant, of the ointment-vender (named Rubin), whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it was to entertain the people with coarse jests (Wolfenb&uuml;ttel, Innsbruck, <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10107a.htm">Mecklenburg</a> Easter Plays, 1464). The <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> Easter Plays, with their <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> texts, were still produced, as well as the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German</a> plays, but gradually, being displaced by the latter, the <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> text was confined to the meagre <a href="../cathen/02543a.htm">Biblical</a> element of the plays and the player's directions. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> still retained the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to direct these productions, even after the plays reflected the spirit and opinions of the times. Popular poetry, gross and worldly, dominated in the plays, particularly susceptible to the influence of the Carnival plays.

<p>The Easter Plays represented in their day the highest development of the secular drama; nevertheless this most important event in the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life of the God-Man</a> did not suffice: the people wished to see His whole <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life</a>, particularly the story of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">Passion</a>. Thus a series of dramas originated, which were called Passion Plays, the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">sufferings of Jesus</a> being their principal subject. Some of them end with the entombment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; in others the Easter Play was added, in order to show the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> in His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; others again close with the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> or with the <a href="../cathen/05046a.htm">dispersion of the Apostles</a>. But, since the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> is intelligible only in the light of His work as teacher, this part of the <a href="../cathen/08377a.htm">life of Christ</a> was also added, while some authors of these plays went back to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> for symbolical scenes, which they added to the Passion Plays as "prefigurations"; or the plays begin with the <a href="../cathen/07310a.htm">Creation</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a>, and the fall of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angels</a>. Again two short dramas were inserted: the Lament of Mary and the Mary Magdalene Play. The <a href="../cathen/12481d.htm">sequence</a> "Planctus ante nescia", which was brought to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> during the latter half of the twelfth century, is the basis for the Lamentations of Mary. This <a href="../cathen/12481d.htm">sequence</a> is merely a monologue of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> at the foot of the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">Cross</a>; by the introduction of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, and the bystanders as taking part in the lamentations, a dramatic scene was developed which became a part of almost all Passion Plays and has been retained even in their latest survivor. The Magdalene Play represents the seduction of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalene</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> life up to her <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>. In <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Magdalene's</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinfulness</a> the people saw a picture of the depraved condition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> after the <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">sin of the Garden</a>, from which it could be <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redeemed</a> only through the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. This profound thought, which could not be effaced even by the coarse reproduction of <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Magdalene's</a> life, explains the presence of this little drama in the Passion Play.



<p>The evolution of the Passion Play was about the same as that of the Easter Play. It originated in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">ritual</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which prescribes, among other things, that the <a href="../cathen/06659a.htm">Gospel</a> on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a> should be sung in parts divided among various <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Later on, Passion Plays, properly so called, made their appearance, first in <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a>, then in <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German</a>; contents and form were adapted more and more to popular <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> until, in the fifteenth century, the popular <a href="../cathen/10348a.htm">religious plays</a> had developed. Thus the <a href="../cathen/02441a.htm">Benedictbeurn</a> Passion Play (thirteenth century) is still largely composed of <a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> ritual sentences in prose and of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">church hymns</a>, and, being designed to be sung, resembles an <a href="../cathen/11270a.htm">oratorio</a>. Yet even this oldest of the Passion Plays already shows, by the interpolation of free translations of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">church hymns</a> and of <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German</a> verses not pertaining to such <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, as well as by the appearance of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of Jesus</a> and <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalene</a> in the action, a tendency to break away from the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">ritual</a> and to adopt a more popular form. From these humble beginnings the Passion Play must have developed very rapidly, since in the fourteenth century we see it at a stage of development which could not have been reached except by repeated practice. From this second period we have the <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> Passion, the <a href="../cathen/06347a.htm">St. Gall</a> Passion, the oldest <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> Passion, and the Maestricht Passion. All four Plays, as they are commonly called, are written in rhyme, principally in <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> Passion embraces the entire history of the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Redemption</a>, and begins with the revolt and fall of <a href="../cathen/09410a.htm">Lucifer</a>; it is to be regretted that the play as transmitted to us ends with the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a>. The oldest <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> Passion play, that of Canon Baldemar von Peterwell (1350-80), the production of which required two days, was more profusely elaborated than the other Passion Plays of this period. Of this play only the "Ordo sive Registrum" has come down to us, a long roll of parchment for the use of the director, containing directions and the first words of the dialogues. The plays based on this list of directions lead us to the period in which the Passion Play reached its highest development (1400-1515). During this period the later <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> Passion Play (1467), the Alsfelder, and the Friedberger (1514) originated. Connected with this group are the Eger, the Donaueschingen, <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Freising</a> and <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a> Passion Plays, in which the whole world drama, beginning with the <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">creation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and brought down to the <a href="../cathen/15614b.htm">coming of the Holy Ghost</a>, is exhibited, and which was produced with great splendour as late as 1583.

<p>Nearly all these Passion Plays have some relation to those coming from the Tyrol, some contributing to, others taking from, that source. These, again, are founded upon the Tyrolese Passion Play which originated during the transition period of the fourteenth to the fifteenth century. Wackernell, with the aid of the plays that have reached us, has reconstructed this period. In the Tyrol the Passion Plays received elaborate cultivation; at Bozen they were presented with great splendour and lasted seven days. Here, too, the innovation of placing the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> r&ocirc;les in the hands of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> was introduced, which innovation did not become general until during the seventeenth century. The magnificent productions of the Passion Plays during the fifteenth century are closely connected with the growth and increasing self-confidence of the cities, which found its expression in noble buildings, <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and municipal, and in gorgeous public <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">festivals</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">artistic</a> sense and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> of the citizens had, in co-operation with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, called these plays into being, and the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of the citizens provided for magnificent productions of them on the public squares, whither they migrated after expulsion from the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>. The citizens and <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> considered it a point of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to render the production as rich and diversified as possible. Ordinarily the preparations for the play were in the hands of a spiritual brotherhood, the play itself being considered a form of <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">worship</a>. People of the most varied classes took part in the production, and frequently the number of actors was as high as two hundred and even greater. If was undoubtedly no small task to drill the performers, particularly since the stage arrangements were still very primitive.

<p>The stage was a wooden structure, almost as broad as it was long, elevated but slightly above the ground and open on all sides. A house formed the background; a balcony attached to the house represented <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. Under the balcony three <a href="../cathen/04533a.htm">crosses</a> were erected. Sometimes the stage was divided into three sections by doors. Along the sides of the stage, taken lengthwise, stood the houses required for the production; they were indicated by fenced-in spaces, or by four posts upon which a roof rested. The entrance into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> was pictured by the mouth of a monster, through which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> captured or released during the plays passed back and forth. The actors entered in <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a>, led by musicians or by a <em>pr&aelig;cursor</em> (herald), and took their stand at the places appointed them. They remained on the stage all through the performance; they sat on the barriers of their respective divisions, and were permitted to leave their places only to recite their lines. As each actor finished speaking, he returned to his place. The audience stood around the stage or looked on from the windows of neighbouring houses. Occasionally platforms, called "bridges", were erected around the stage in the form of an amphitheatre.

<p>The scenery was as simple as the stage. There were no side scenes, and consequently no stage perspective. Since an illusion of reality could not be had, indications were made to suffice. Thus a cask standing on end represents the mountain on which <a href="../cathen/14504b.htm">Christ is tempted by the devil</a>; thunder is imitated by the report of a gun; in order to signify that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> had entered into him, <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> holds a bird of black plumage before his mouth and makes it flutter. The <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a> of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> is an execution, in which <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> performs the hangman's <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. He precedes the culprit up the ladder and draws <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> after him by a rope. <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> has a black bird and the intestines of an animal concealed in the front of his clothing, and when <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> tears open the garment the bird flies away, and the intestines fall out, whereupon <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> and his executioner slide down into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> on a rope. A <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted picture</a> representing the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is hung from the mouth of each of the two thieves on the <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a>; the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> takes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the penitent, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> that of the impenitent thief. Everything is presented in the concrete, just as the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> of the audience pictures it, and the scenic conditions, resembling those of the antique theatre demand. All costume, however, is contemporary, historical accuracy being ignored.

<p>The Passion Plays of the fifteenth century, with their peculiar blending of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a>, <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">artistic</a>, and popular elements, gave a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> picture of German city life of those times. Serious thought and lively humour were highly developed in these plays. When, however, the patricians, in the sixteenth century, withdrew more and more from the plays, these, left to the lower classes, began to lose their serious and (in spite of the comic traits) dignified character. The influence of the Carnival plays (<em>Fastnachtspiele</em>) was felt more and more. Master Grobianus with his coarse and obscene jests was even introduced into the Passion Plays. In time the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> forbade the production of the plays. Thus the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Havelberg commanded his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, in 1471, to suppress the Passion Plays and legend plays in their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish districts</a> because of the disgraceful and irrelevant farces interspersed through the productions. In a similar manner the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">Synod</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> (1549) opposed the <a href="../cathen/10348a.htm">religious plays</a>, and the year previous (1548), the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> forbade the production of "the <a href="../cathen/10348a.htm">Mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">Passion</a> of our <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Redeemer</a> and other <a href="../cathen/10348a.htm">Spiritual Mysteries</a>". One consequence was that the secular plays were separated from the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a>, and, as Carnival plays, held the public favour. The Passion Plays came to be presented more rarely, particularly as the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was inimical to them.

<p>School dramas now came into vogue in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> schools, and frequently enough became the battle-ground of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> controversies. When, in the seventeenth century, the splendidly equipped <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> drama arose, the Passion Plays were relegated to out-of-the-way villages and to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, particularly in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, during the so-called age of enlightenment, efforts were made in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, particularly in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and the Tyrol, to destroy even the remnants of the tradition of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> plays. Public interest in the Passion Play awoke anew during the last decades of the nineteenth century, and since then Brixlegg and Vorderthiersee in the Tyrol, H&ouml;ritz in southern <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, and above all, Oberammergau in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Upper Bavaria</a> attract thousands to their plays. The text of the play of Vorderthiersee (<em>Gespiel in der Vorderen Thiersee</em>) dates from the second half of the seventeenth century, is entirely in verse, and comprises in five acts the events recorded in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/14341a.htm">Last Supper</a> to the Entombment. A prelude (<em>Vorgespiel</em>), on the Good Shepherd, precedes the play. After being repeatedly remodelled, the text received its present classical form from the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, P. Weissenhofer. Productions of the play, which came from <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> to the Tyrol in the second half of the eighteenth century, were arranged at irregular intervals during the first half of the nineteenth century; since 1855 they have taken place at regular intervals, at Brixlegg every ten years. The H&ouml;ritz Passion Play, the present text of which is from the pen of Provost Landsteiner, has been produced every five years, since 1893.

<p>The chief survival, however, of former times is the Passion Play of Oberammergau. The first mention we find of it is in 1633, when if is referred to in connection with a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> made to obtain relief from the Black Death, when the people of Ammergau vowed to produce the play every ten years. As early as 1634 the Passion was enacted (<em>tragiert</em>). Since this Passion Play was then well-known, productions must have taken place before that date. The oldest text still in existence was written about 1600 and contains traces of two older dramas, one of which was preserved at St. Ulric, the other at St. Afra, <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>. In 1662 a Passion text by the <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> Meistersinger, Sebastian Wild, was woven into it, together with parts of the Weilheim Passion Play of Rector Johann Aelbel (c. 1600). About the middle of the eighteenth century the text was revised by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Rosner, after the model of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> drama; in 1780 this bombastic version was again reduced to a simpler form by the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Knipfelberger. Finally, P. Otmar Weiss and M. Daisenberger gave it its present simple and dignified form, and transcribed the verse into prose. Stage and costuming are adapted to modern requirements. The <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">music</a> is by Rochus Dedler. (See also <a href="../cathen/10348a.htm">MIRACLE PLAYS AND MYSTERIES</a>.)
