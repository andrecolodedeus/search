<h1>Pastoral Theology</h1>  

<p>Pastoral theology is the science of the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. This article will give the definition of pastoral theology, its relations to other <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological sciences</a>, its history, sources, and contents.
<h2 id="section1">Definition</h2>

<p>Pastoral <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> is a branch of practical <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>; it is essentially a practical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. All branches of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, whether theoretical or practical, purpose in one way or another to make <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> "the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the dispensers of the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co004.htm#vrs1">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>). Pastoral <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> presupposes other various branches; accepts the apologetic, dogmatic, exegetic, moral, juridical, ascetical, <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a>, and other conclusions reached by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> student, and scientifically applies these various conclusions to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> ministry.
<h2 id="section2">Relation to other theological sciences</h2>

<p>Dogmatic <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> establishes the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as the depository of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and systematizes the deposit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which Christ entrusted to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to hand down to all generations; pastoral theology teaches the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> his part in this work of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> tradition of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Moral <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> explains the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">laws of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/04154a.htm">of the Church</a>, the means of grace and hindrances thereto; pastoral theology teaches the practical bearing of these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> means, and hindrances upon the daily life of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, alone and in touch with his people. Canon law collects, correlates, and co-ordinates the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; pastoral theology applies those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. In brief, pastoral theology begins, where the other <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> leave off; takes the results of them all and makes these results effective for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> through the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> established by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.
<h2 id="section3">History</h2>

<p>The name pastoral theology is new; the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> is as old as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself, as appears from the manifold instructions given by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> to His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> for the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> (<a href="../bible/mat010.htm#vrs6">Matthew 10:6 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/mar006.htm#vrs8">Mark 6:8 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/luk009.htm#vrs3">Luke 9:3 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs4">10:4 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/luk022.htm#vrs35">22:35</a>) and from the pastoral letters of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> and the very detailed instructions they give to Timothy and to Titus in regard to the sacred ministry. The writings of the Fathers, from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> age onward, are replete with pastoral instruction. <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">St. Ignatius of Antioch</a> [A.D. 110 [Harnack]) scatters such advice throughout his epistles &#151; see, for instance, "Ad Magnesios" (Harnack's ed., "Patres apostolici", II, 29). The letters of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (A.D. 248) are, many of them, either wholly or in part written about the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> (cf. P.L., IV, 194 sq.) &#151; "Qui Antistites in ecclesia eligendi?", "Qualis esse debeat vita sacerdotum?" etc. His <a href="../fathers/050703.htm">"De lapsis"</a> (P.L., IV, 477) is a classic among pastoral instructions. <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory Nazianzen</a> (A.D. 389), explaining his flight to <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, tells his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in "Oratio apologetica de fuga sua", a work sometimes called "De sacerdotio" (P.G., XXXV, 408), and sets down pastoral care as a great <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and art, "Ars qu&aelig;dam artium et scientia scientiarum mihi esse videtur hominem regere". Other landmarks in the history of pastoral theology are <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, "De officiis ministrorum" (P.L., XVI, 25); <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a>, "De sacerdotio" (P.G., XLVIII, 623); <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a>, "De institutione clericorum", "De institutionibus monachorum", "De regulis clericorum" (P.L., LXXXIV, 25, 45, 77); <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard's</a> letters and treatises "De consideratione", "De moribus episcoporum", "De conversione ad clericos" (P.L., CLXXXII, 727, 809, 833). The great classic among patristic works on the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is "Regul&aelig; pastoralis liber" (P.L., LXXVII, 13), written by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> (c. A.D. 590) to John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>.

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, there was not yet a separated and systematized <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of pastoral theology. <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholasticism</a> did not recognize this <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> apart from other branches of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Dogma and moral were so taught as to include the application of their conclusions to the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Still, even then writings of the great <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctors of the Church</a> were at times purely pastoral; such were the "Opuscula", 17-20, of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>; <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure's</a> "De sex alis seraphim", "De regimine anim&aelig;", "Confessionale"; the "Summa theologica" (Books II, III), together with the "Summa confessionalis" of <a href="../cathen/01585b.htm">St. Antoninus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>. At the same time, writers on <a href="../cathen/14621a.htm">mystical theology</a> (see V. <a href="../cathen/14621a.htm">MYSTICAL THEOLOGY</a>) have often entered into the domain of pastoral theology. Not until the period of the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a> did the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of pastoral theology take its present systematized form. During the latter half of the fifteenth century, in certain places, pastoral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> were very much neglected. By the dawn of the sixteenth century, the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> was to many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and not a few <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> a lost or a never-acquired art, with the result that the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> were ready to throw off what was deemed to be a useless <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> yoke. In such places, a reform of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was sorely needed. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> set itself to bring about a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reformation of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> followed the lead of the council. The result was the treatment of the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> as a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> by itself. During the following centuries of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reform and of battle with <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> reform, the most scientific treatises on pastoral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> were written. <a href="../cathen/08469a.htm">John of Avila</a>, <a href="../cathen/09385b.htm">Louis of Granada</a>, Peter <a href="../cathen/14152a.htm">de Soto</a>, Claude le Jay (Institutiones practic&aelig;), Neumayr (Vir apostolicus), <a href="../cathen/12317a.htm">Possevin</a> (Praxis cur&aelig; pastoralis), Segneri, <a href="../cathen/11240d.htm">Olier</a>, Molina, Toledo (De instructione sacerdotum), <a href="../cathen/03145c.htm">Cardinal Cajetan</a>, <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> (Instructio pastorum), the works of <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>, of Rodriguez, of Scaramelli &#151; such are a few of the scientific treatises that did much to illumine and to strengthen the <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04437a.htm">Counter-Reformation</a>, In 1759 <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a> issued his great pastoral theology, "Homo apostolicus". He epitomized the conclusions reached by him in his "Moral Theology", applied these conclusions practically to the work of hearing <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>, and added four appendices bearing specifically upon such pastoral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as the direction of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, the assistance of the dying, the examination of those to be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of confessors and <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> in regard to their own as well as their flock's sanctification. This work, together with the legislation of <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> in the matter of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, gave a great impetus to the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of pastoral theology.


<h2 id="section4">Sources</h2>

<p>Tradition and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Bible</a>, in so far as they portray the ideal Priest, Teacher, and Pastor, and hand down to us His <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> for the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, are the first sources of pastoral theology. As evidence of Tradition the decrees of <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a> are of the highest moment. Next come pontifical Constitutions &#151; <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a>, Briefs, and Motu Proprios; decrees of <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>; the works cited in Sanford-Drum, op. cit. below; the various sources of dogmatic and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> and of canon law, in so far as they bear directly or indirectly upon the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Decrees of various provincial councils and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> together with pastoral letters of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are also among the sources whence pastoral theology draws. For <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation, one must follow the "Acta Apostolic&aelig; Sedis", a monthly official bulletin published in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> authentic interpretations, decisions and <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescripts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> is now effected <em>ipso facto</em> by publication in this periodical. For past decisions the various <em>decreta authentica</em> of different <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a> must be consulted. Such are "Thesaurus resolutionum Sacr&aelig; Congregationis Concilii", from 1718 (Rome); "Decreta authentica Congregationis Sacrorum Rituum" (Rome, 1898); "Decreta authentica sacr&aelig; Congregationis Indulgentiis Sacrisque Reliquiis Pr&aelig;posit&aelig;", from 1668 to 1882 (Ratisbon); Pallottini, "Collectio omnium decretorum Sacr&aelig; Congregationis Concilii" (Rome, 1868); Bizarri, "Collectanea Sacr&aelig; Congregationis Episcoporum et Regularium" (Rome, 1863, 1885); "Collectanea Sacr&aelig; Congregationis de Propaganda Fide" (Rome, 1893, 1907). A handy reference work in this matter is <a href="../cathen/06048a.htm">Ferraris</a>, "Prompta bibliotheca", together with its supplement edited by Bucceroni (Rome, 1885). Ojetti, "Synopsis rerum moralium et juris pontificii" (Prato, 1904), is also useful. For the pastoral care of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities, <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> information may be obtained from Vermeersch, "De religiosis et missionariis supplementa et monumenta", together with the periodical supplements thereto (Bruges, 1904--), and Dom Bastien, "Constitution de L&eacute;on XIII sur les instituts a voeux simples et leur relations avec les autorit&eacute;s dioc&eacute;saines" (Bruges), a work which has been translated into English by Lanslots (<a href="../cathen/12583a.htm">Pustet</a>, New York). Periodicals giving current direction and information as to the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are: "Acta Sanct&aelig; Sedis" (Rome, from 1865), now discontinued; "Analecta juris pontificii" (Rome, 1833; Paris, 1869), replaced by "Analecta ecclesiastica" (Rome, 1893-1911); "II Monitore Ecclesiastico" (Rome, 1876); "The American Ecclesiastical Review" (Philadelphia, 1889); "The Irish Ecclesiastical Record" (Dublin, 1865); "Nouvelle Revue Th&eacute;ologique" (Tournai, 1869); "Theologischpraktische Quartalschrift" (Linz); "Zeitschrift f&uuml;r katholische Theologie" (Innsbruck, 1877).
<h2 id="section5">Contents</h2>

<p>From the days when <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> wrote his classic "Regul&aelig; pastoralis liber", the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> that make for the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> have been conveniently divided into those of the teacher, of the minister of the sacred mysteries, and of the shepherd; pastoral theology purposes to impart the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of these <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and of the treatise known as "pastoral medicine", the medical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> requisite for the proper care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p>Under the head of teacher are treated the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of teaching, the qualities of the teacher, his training, the models of teaching left us by the Fathers and <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctors of the Church</a>, as well as by distinguished preachers and catechists, and the occasions and forms of instruction suited for the various needs of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, young and old, literate and illiterate. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, in the fifth session, lays down a twofold <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the teacher, to preach on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and festivals, and to give <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction to children and to others who have need of such instruction. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, in his Constitution, "Etsi Minime", calls special attention to this latter most important <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, in his <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> on the teaching of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> (15 April, 1905), insists once again on the paramount need of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction. All <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and all others to whom the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is committed, must teach the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> to their young girls and boys for the space of one hour on all <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and holy days of the year without exception, and must explain to them what one is bound to believe and practise in order to be saved. These children shall, at stated times during each year, be prepared by more extended instruction for the Sacraments of Penance and Confirmation. Daily instruction during <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, and even after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, will make the young children of both sexes ready for their first <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>. Moreover, an hour every <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> and holy day shall be devoted to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instruction of adults. This lesson in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>, in plain and simple language, is to be given over and above the Sunday <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> on the Gospel and the children's instruction in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>.

<p>As minister of the sacred mysteries, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> must not only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the nature of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, so far as <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">dogmatic theology</a> explains it, besides what is needed for their valid administration, as taught in <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, but must also possess such additional <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as may serve him in his spiritual ministrations &#151; for instance, in attending the sick, in advising what is lawful or unlawful in critical operations, especially in such as may affect childbirth; in directing others, when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, how to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> the unborn child; in deciding whether to confer extreme unction or other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in cases of apparent death, etc.

<p>Finally, as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, a variety of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> have to be mastered, which keep growing and varying in number constantly with the complicated conditions of modern life, especially wherever there is a tendency to mass people together in large cities, or wherever migration to and fro causes frequent change. This, perhaps, is the main part of pastoral theology. The organization of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; the maintenance of a church and other institutions that grow up around it; the management of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; the formation of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> for men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, young and old; the vast number of social works into which a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in a modern city is almost necessarily drawn &#151; all these points furnish material for instruction, which, as the fruit of experience, can rarely be conveyed through books. Usually the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> acquires sufficient <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all these things from prudent directors as he goes through his <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> course, or from his own experience under a competent <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>; but gradually an extensive literature on these subjects has accumulated during the past half century, and it is the systematization of such writings that constitutes pastoral theology.
