<h1>Patras</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> in <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>. It was one of the twelve ancient cities of <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>, built near Mount Panachaicon (now Voidia), and formed of three small districts, Aroe, Antheia, and Mesatis. After the Dorian invasion Patreus established there a colony from Laconia, and gave his name to the city. In the Peloponnesian War it took sides with Athens, and, in 419 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>, Alcibiades advised the construction of long walls to connect the town with its harbour. Reverses having reduced it to extreme misery, <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> restored it after the victory at Actium by a military colony, called Aroe Patrensis, the existence of which till the reign of <a href="../cathen/06648b.htm">Gordianus III</a> is attested by <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a>. It became very prosperous through its commerce and especially through its weaving industry. In the sixth century it suffered from an earthquake (Procopius, "Bell. Goth.", IV, xxv), and afterwards from the ravages of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>. In 807, however, it resisted the attacks of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> and, in return, received the title of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> from the Emperor Nicephorus I. Patras was dependent on <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> until 733, when it became subject to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of the beginning of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in the city, unless we accept the tradition that it was evangelized by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> St. Andrew. A celebrated Stylite lived there in the tenth century, to whom St. Luke the Younger went to be trained (P.G., CXI, 451). In 1205 William of Champlitte took possession and installed canons; they in turn elected Anthelme, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of Cluny, as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. The territory formed a barony subject to the Aleman <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and included in the principality of Morea or <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>. The Latin <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> held it from the second half of the thirteenth century till 1408, when they sold it to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. In 1429 it again fell into the power of the Greeks, and was taken by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in 1460. Under the Ottoman dominion Patras became the capital of the pashalik of Morea, and underwent severe trials. In 1532 it was captured by Andrea Doria; in 1571, at the time of the Battle of <a href="../cathen/09181b.htm">Lepanto</a>, the Greek <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> aroused the populace on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> and was cut to pieces by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. It was burnt by the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> in 1595; pillaged by the Maltese in 1603, and captured by the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> on 24 July, 1687, and kept by them for thirty years. In 1770, at the instigation of the Russians, the city revolted, and was sacked by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. On 4 April, 1821, it rose unsuccessfully against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Ottomans</a>, who held it until it was delivered by General Maison on 5 October, 1828. It is now the capital of the nome <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a>, and has 38,000 inhabitants.

<p>The Greek see, first dependent on Corinth, became a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> in the ninth century. It had four suffragans (Gelzer, "Ungedruckte . . . Texte der Notiti&aelig; episcopatuum", 557); then five about 940 (Gelzer, "Georgii Cyprii Descriptio orbis Romani", 77); after 1453 it had only two, which successively disappeared (Gelzer, op. cit., 634). Its titulars were called Metropolitans of Patras from the ninth century until the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, Metropolitans of Old Patras until 1833, Bishops of <a href="../cathen/01101c.htm">Achaia</a> until 1852, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Patras and Eleia from that time. The list of its titulars has been compiled by <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> (Oriens christ., II, 177-82), Gelzer (in Gerland, "Neue Quellen zur Geschichte des lateinischen Erzbistums Patras", Leipzig, 1903), 247-55, Pargoire (in "Echos d'Orient", VII, 103-07). The Latin archdiocese, created in 1205, lasted until 1441, when it became a <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a>. It had five suffragans, Andravida, <a href="../cathen/01444a.htm">Amycl&aelig;</a>, Modone, Corone, and <a href="../cathen/15750a.htm">Cephalonia-Zante</a>; even when Modone and Corone belonged to the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> they continued to depend on Patras. The list of Latin titulars has been drawn up by <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> (op. cit., III, 1023-32), Eubel (Hierarchia cath. med. &aelig;vi, I, 412; II, 236; III, 289), and Gerland (op. cit., 244-46). In 1640 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> established themselves at Patras, and in 1687 the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>. In the nineteenth century the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> confided the administration of the Peloponnesus to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15750a.htm">Zante</a>, in 1834 to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14395a.htm">Syra</a>. Since 1874 the city has formed a part of the Apostolic Delegation of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>. It contains from 8000 to 10,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work is in charge of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. There is a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Sisters of the Immaculate Conception of <a href="../cathen/08258a.htm">Ivrea</a>.
