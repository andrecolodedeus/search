<h1>Patrician Brothers</h1>  

<p>(Or BROTHERS OF SAINT PATRICK).

<p>This Brotherhood was founded by the Right Rev. Dr. Daniel Delaney, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08637a.htm">Kildare and Leighlin</a>, at Tullow, in the County of Carlow, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, on the feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in 1808, for the religious and literary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth and the instruction of the faithful in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> was at this period just emerging from the troubled times of the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a>. These <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> made it treasonable for a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> parent to procure for his child a religious and secular <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in consonance with his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, and consequently not only were the young deprived of the means of instruction, but adults also were in a state of enforced <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> and its practices. Bishop Delaney set about the good work of founding the Religious congregation of the Brothers of Saint Patrick in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, for the purpose of affording his people that <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of which they had been so long deprived. He chose from among the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> instructors of the Sunday <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> seven young men who formed the nucleus of the new order, and under the personal instruction of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and direction of his successor, the illustrious <a href="../cathen/05151a.htm">Dr. Doyle</a>, the congregation was established as a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> institution. In succeeding years filiations were established in other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and the Brothers were invited by several Australian and Indian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to these distant countries. Several foundations were made, among them those of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a>, to which archdiocese the Brothers were invited by <a href="../cathen/14366a.htm">Cardinal Moran</a>; and that of <a href="../cathen/09515a.htm">Madras</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, undertaken at the request of the late <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, Bishop Stephen Fennelly.

<p>In 1885 the Brothers made application to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for the approval of the congregation, for constituting a central government and for establishing a common <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. The request was granted. After taking the opinions of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in whose <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> the Brothers were labouring, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> provisionally approved the congregation for five years by a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">Rescript</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 6 January, 1888, and on 8 September, 1893, issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of final confirmation, highly commending the good work hitherto accomplished by the Brothers, approving of their rules and constitutions, granting them all the facilities and powers <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for carrying on the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of their congregation, constituting <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and Australia separate provinces, and imparting to the institute the Apostolic Benediction. The houses of the order, which had hitherto been independent and separate communities, were united under a superior general who with four assistants governs the congregation.

<p>A general chapter of the Patrician communities assembles every six years. As a result of the confirmation of the institute the Brothers have been enabled to perfect and extend their congregation in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and to open new colleges, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> in the above-mentioned foreign countries. The scope of their work, which embraces primary, intermediate and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, has been much extended in recent years. The introduction of a scheme of technical and scientific study by the different <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> departments has been warmly supported by the Brotherhood; while by their management of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a> and industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> they aid thousands of youths to raise themselves to a higher place in the social scale. Their residential colleges and secondary day-schools equip the students for responsible positions in life. The colleges of the Brothers in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> are affiliated to the Allahabad and Calcutta Universities, in which their students have distinguished themselves; while in <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, notwithstanding that the Brothers receive no State aid, their pupils compete successfully with those of the highly subsidized Government <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for positions in the civil service. On the occasion of the centenary in 1908, His Holiness <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a> bestowed on the order many favours and special <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. The superior general and his assistants reside at the mother-house, Tullow, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, where are also the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and house of studies.
