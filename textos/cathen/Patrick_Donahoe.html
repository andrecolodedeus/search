<h1>Patrick Donahoe</h1>  

<p>Publisher, born at Munnery, County Cavan, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 17 March, 1811; died at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston, U.S.A.</a>, 18 March, 1901. He <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> when ten years of age with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and at fourteen was apprenticed to a printer. He worked on "The Jesuit" when that paper was started by Bishop Fenwick in 1832, and after the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> relinquished its ownership, he carried it on for some time with H.L. Devereaux under the new title of "The Literary and Catholic Sentinel". In 1836 he began the publication of "The Pilot", a weekly paper devoted to <a href="../cathen/08132b.htm">Irish-American</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests, which in succeeding years became the organ of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> opinion in New England. He established in connection with it a publishing and book-selling house from which were issued a large number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> books. Later he organized a bank. All his ventures proved successful and the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> he acquired was generously given to advance <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. The great <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> fire of 1872 destroyed his publishing plant. Another fire in the following year and injudicious loans to friends made him lose so much more that his bank failed in 1876. Archbishop Williams purchased "The Pilot" to help to pay the depositors of the bank, and Mr. Donahoe then started a monthly "Donahoe's Magazine" and an exchange and passenger agency. In 1881 he was able to buy back "The Pilot" and devoted his remaining years to its management. During the Civil War he actively interested himself in the organization of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> regiments that volunteered from New England. In 1893 the <a href="../cathen/11132a.htm">University of Notre Dame</a> gave him the Laetare Medal for signal services to American <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> progress.
