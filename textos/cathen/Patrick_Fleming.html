<h1>Patrick Fleming</h1>  

<p>Franciscan friar b. at Lagan, Couny Louth, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 17 April, 1599; d. 7 November, 1631. His father was great-grandson of Lord Slane; his mother was daughter of Robert Cusack, a baron of the exchequer and a near relative of Lord Delvin. In 1612, at a time when religious <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> raged in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, young Fleming went to <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, and became a student, first at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, and then at the College of St. Anthony of Padua at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. In 1617 he took the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> habit and a year later made his solemn profession. He then assumed in religion the name of Patrick, Christopher being the name he received at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Five years after his solemn profession he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with Hugh MacCaghwell, the definitor general of the order, and when he had completed his studies at the College of St. Isidore, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. From <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he was sent by his superiors to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> and for some years lectured there on philosophy. During that time he established a reputation for scholarship and administrative capacity, and when the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> of the Strict Observance opened a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at Prague in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, Fleming was appointed its first superior. He was also lecturer in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years War</a> was raging at this time, and in 1631 the Elector of Saxony invaded <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and threatened Prague. Fleming, accompanied by a fellow-countryman named Matthew Hoar, fled from the city. On 7 November the fugitives encountered a party of armed <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> peasants; and the latter animated with the fierce fanaticism of the times, fell upon the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> them. Fleming's body was carried to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Voticium, four miles distant from the scene of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and there buried.

<p>Eminent both in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, he was specially devoted to <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, his tastes in this direction being still further developed by his friendship for his learned countryman <a href="../cathen/15550a.htm">Father Hugh Ward</a>. The latter, desirous of writing on early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, asked for Fleming's assistance which was readily given. Even before Fleming left <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> for Prague he had massed considerable materials and had written a "Life of St. Columba". It was not, however, published in his lifetime. That and other <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> fell into the hands of Thomas O'Sheerin, lecturer in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the College of St. Anthony of Padua who edited and published them at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in 1667. Fleming also wrote a life of Hugh MacCaghwell, <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Armagh, a chronicle of St. Peter's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> (an ancient <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> foundation), and letters to Hugh Ratison on the lives and works of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. The letters have been published in "The Irish Ecclesiastical Record" (see below). The work published at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in 1667 is now rare and costly; one copy in recent years was sold for seventy pounds.
