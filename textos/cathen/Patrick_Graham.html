<h1>Patrick Graham</h1>  

<p>First <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of St. Andrews and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth uncertain; d. 1478. He was a son of Mary, younger daughter of Robert III, by her third husband, Sir William Graham of Kincardine, ancestor of the dukes of Montrose. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the University of St. Andrews, where, in 1457, he held the position of dean of the <a href="../cathen/01757a.htm">Faculty of Arts</a>. In 1463 he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Brechin. In 1466 he succeeded his half-brother, the illustrious Bishop Kennedy, in the See of St. Andrews. He proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to receive the confirmation of <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a>, and remained abroad until 1469 to escape the avowed enmity of certain powerful nobles. While in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he obtained the erection of St. Andrews into an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a> and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church, to which the other twelve sees were subjected as suffragans. This was announced to the king, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> chapters of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 27 Aug., 1472. The announcement aroused a storm of opposition. The See of York ineffectually appealed against the loss of <a href="../cathen/06370a.htm">Galloway</a>, its suffragan for more than five centuries, and the consequent deprivation of all future claim to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>; that of <a href="../cathen/15064a.htm">Trondhjem</a> as ineffectually resented the transference of the Dioceses of Argyle and the Isles; the king and the whole episcopate of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> set themselves to resist the innovation, rendered still more odious by the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Apostolic nuncio</a> to raise subsidies for a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>. James III, bribed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> with an offering of 12,000 marks (according to some writers), joined them in appealing to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> against his cousin the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, in view of the extraordinary charges brought against Graham, sent a <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, John Huseman, to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> to investigate. The accusation included <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, disobedience to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, with reviling and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against its authority; the claiming by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, as imposed upon him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the appointment of <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, prothonotaries, and suchlike officials; the revoking of <a href="../cathen/07788a.htm">papal indulgences</a>, because granted for lucre; the saying of Mass, even thrice a day, when under the ban of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, suspension, and <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, after examining numerous witnesses, sent a report to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and, after its due consideration by a commission of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, Graham was declared guilty of the alleged charges. He was deprived of all dignities, degraded from orders, and subjected to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for life. He died in the Castle of Lochleven in 1478, and was buried in the old <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> there. Many historians regard him as a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and good <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, a victim to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of his enemies, though this scarcely explains his condemnation. Whether he lost his reason under the stress of trouble, or whether he had become imbued with Lollardism (as Dickson suggests, though the charge concerning Mass seems to contradict this), it is impossible to say, in the absence of all official records except the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of deposition, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 9 Jan., 1478.
