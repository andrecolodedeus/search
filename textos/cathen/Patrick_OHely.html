<h1>Patrick O'Hely</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Mayo, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; d. At Kilmallock, September, 1579. He was a native of Connaught, and joined the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at an early age. Four years after his profession he was sent to the <a href="../cathen/01271a.htm">University of Alcal&aacute;</a>, where he surpassed his contemporaries in sacred studies. Summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he was promoted in 1576 to the See of Mayo, now merged in that of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>. <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> empowered him to officiate in adjoining <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, if no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> were at hand, and supplied him generously with money. At <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> he took part in public disputations at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, amazing his hearers by his mastery of patristic and controversial <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, as well as of <a href="../cathen/13610b.htm">Scotist</a> philosophy. In autumn, 1579, he sailed from Brittany and arrived off the coast of <a href="../cathen/08627a.htm">Kerry</a> after James Fitzmaurice had landed at Smerwick from <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> with the remnant of Stukeley's expedition. All Munster was then in arms. The House of Desmond was divided, and the politic earl had withdrawn from the scene of action. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his companion, Conn O'Rourke, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> priest, son of Brian, Lord of Breifne, came ashore near Askeaton, and sought hospitality at the castle where, in the earl's absence, his countess entertained them. Next day they departed for Limerick; but the countess, probably so instructed, for the earl claimed the merit afterwards, gave information to the Mayor of <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, who three days later seized the two <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and sent them to Kilmallock where Lord Justice Drury then was with an army. As president of Munster, Drury had recently perpetrated <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> barbarities. In one year he executed four hundred <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> "by <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and martial law". Some he sentenced "by <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>, for that he found no law to try them by in the realm". At first he offered to secure O'Hely his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> if he would acknowledge the royal supremacy and disclose his business. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> replied that he could not barter his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for life or honours; his business was to do a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> part in advancing religion and saving <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. To questions about the plans of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> for invading <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> he made no answer, and thereupon was delivered to torture. As he still remained silent, he and O'Rourke were sent to instant execution by martial law. The execution took place outside one of the gates of Kilmallock.
