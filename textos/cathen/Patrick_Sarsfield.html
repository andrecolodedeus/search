<h1>Patrick Sarsfield</h1>  

<p>Born at Lucan near <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, about 1650; died at Huy in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, 1693. On his mother's side he was descended from the O'Mores, princes of Leix, his grandfather being Roger More, the ablest of the leaders who planned the rebellion of 1641; on his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> side from Anglo-Norman stock. One of his ancestors was mayor of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> in 1566 and was <a href="../cathen/01695a.htm">knighted</a> by Sir Henry Sidney for valuable services rendered to the Government against Shane O'Neill. Another Sarsfield, in the reign of Charles I, became a peer with the title of Lord Kilmallock. His father left him landed <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> bringing an income of &#163;2000 sterling a year. His elder brother was married to an <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> daughter of Charles II, sister of the Duke of Monmouth, and it was as an ensign in Monmouth's Regiment of Foot that Sarsfield first saw service in the army of <a href="../cathen/09465a.htm">Luxembourg</a>; but at Sedgemoor, where he was wounded, Sarsfield was on the king's side. In 1688 he followed James II to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and landed with him at Kinsale in the following year. James recognized his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a>, but thought him incapable of high command. Nevertheless in 1689 he captured Sligo and secured all Connaught for the king. At the Boyne he was compelled to inactivity, and when James fled to Dublin he took Sarsfield with him. After James's departure for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, it was largely through Sarsfield that <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a> was defended so well, and it was he who destroyed William's siege train, the most brilliant exploit of the whole <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. James was so well pleased with him that he created him Earl of Lucan. In the campaign of 1691 he held a subordinate position under St. Ruth. The two often disagreed, and at Aughrim St. Ruth allowed Sarsfield no active share in the battle, leaving him in command of the cavalry reserve. When St. Ruth fell Sarsfield could not turn defeat into victory, but he saved the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> from utter destruction. In the second siege of <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a> he was again prominent, but finding prolonged resistance impossible assented to the Treaty of Limerick, which ended the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. He then joined the army of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in which with the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Brigade he saw much service. At Landen in 1693, he commanded the left wing of <a href="../cathen/09465a.htm">Luxembourg's</a> army, and there received his death wound. There is a tradition that as he lay mortally wounded he put his hand to his wound, and drawing it forth covered with blood, he lamented that the blood was not shed for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. He was carried to Huy where he lingered for a few days. His <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> married the Duke of Berwick.
