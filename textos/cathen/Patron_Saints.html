<h1>Patron Saints</h1>  

<p>A patron is one who has been assigned by a venerable tradition, or chosen by election, as a special intercessor with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the proper advocate of a particular locality, and is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people with a special form of religious observance. The term "patron", being wider in its meaning than that of "titular", may be applied to a church, a district, a country, or a corporation. The word "titular" is applied only to the patron of a church or institution. Both the one and the other, according to the legislation now in force, must have the rank of a <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>.
<h2>Patrons of Churches</h2>
<h3>Origin</h3>

<p>During the first three centuries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> history, the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> assembled for worship in private houses, in <a href="../cathen/03504a.htm">cemeteries</a>, or other retired places. At intervals it had been possible to erect or adapt buildings for the sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of religion. Such buildings, however, were not <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, but were spoken of as the House of God, the House of Prayer, and sometimes as the Temple of God. They were also known as <em>Kyriaca, Dominica, or Oratoria</em>. Larger structures received the name of <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>, and the term <em>church</em> (<em>ecclesia</em>) was constantly employed to designate the place where the faithful assembled to hear the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and partake of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. After peace had been given to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by Constantine, sacred edifices were freely erected, the emperor setting the example by the character and magnificence of his own foundations. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> had always held in deep <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">reverence</a> the memory of the heroes who had sealed with blood the profession of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The celebration of the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> rites had long been intimately associated with the places where the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> reposed, and the choice of sites for the new edifices was naturally determined by the scene of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs'</a> sufferings, or by the spot where their sacred remains lay enshrined. The great <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> founded by Constantine, or during his lifetime, illustrate this tendency. The churches of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter</a>, <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul outside the walls</a>, St. Lawrence in Agro Verano, St. Sebastian, St. Agnes on the Via Nomentana were all cemeterial <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>, i.e. they were built over the spot where the bodies of each of these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> lay <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a>. The same practice finds illustration in the churches of SS. Domitilla and Generosa, SS. Nereus and Achilleus, St. Felix at <a href="../cathen/11089b.htm">Nola</a>, and others. From this custom of rendering <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were derived the names of <em>Memori&oelig;</em> (memorial churches), <em>Martyria</em>, or <em>Confessio</em>, frequently given to churches. The name of "Title" (<em>Titulus</em>) has from the earliest times been employed with reference to the name of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> by which a church is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. The practice of placing the body or some <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> under the altar of sacrifice has been perpetuated in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but the dedication was early extended to <a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">confessors</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who were not <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. The underlying <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of patrons is that of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">communion of saints</a>, or the bond of spiritual union existing between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> servants on earth, in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, or in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are thereby regarded as the advocates and <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercessors</a> of those who are making their earthly <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>.
<h3>Choice of patrons</h3>

<p>Down to the seventeenth century <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">popular devotion</a>, under the guidance of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, chose as the titulars of churches those men or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> renowned for their <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, the saintliness of their lives, or their apostolic ministry in <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converting</a> a nation to the Gospel. <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> (23 March, 1638) laid down the rules that should guide the faithful in the future selection of patrons of churches, cities, and countries, without, however, interfering with the traditional patrons then <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> (<a href="../cathen/01111c.htm">Acta S. Sedis</a>, XI, 292). As during the days of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> the most illustrious among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were those who had <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> their lives for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it was to be expected that during the fourth century the selection of the names of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> as titulars would everywhere prevail. But with the progress of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in times of comparative peace, with the development of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, and the preaching of the Gospel in the different countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> displayed in their lives lofty examples of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Churches, therefore, began to be dedicated in their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. The choice of a particular patron has depended upon many circumstances. These, as a rule, have been one or other of the following: <ul><li>(1) The possession of the body or some important <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>; <li>(2) his announcement of the Gospel to the nation; <li>(3) his labours or death in the locality; <li>(4) his adoption as the national patron; <li>(5) the special devotion of the founder of the church; <li>(6) the spirit of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> devotion at a given time.</ul>

<p><a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> enumerated (28 Nov., 1897) as characteristic religious movements of our time: <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">devotion to the Sacred Heart</a>, to Our Lady of the Rosary, to <a href="../cathen/13356b.htm">St. Joseph</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. It should be clearly understood that a church is, and always has been, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: other dedications are annexed on an entirely different plane. Thus a church is dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> (for example) of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. A typical form is the following: "Deo sacrum in honorem deipar&aelig; immaculat&aelig; et SS. Joannis Baptist&aelig; et Evangelist&aelig;." In 1190 a <a href="../cathen/04114a.htm">collegiate</a> church in Dublin was dedicated "to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Blessed Lady</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>". Sometimes out of several who are mentioned the patron is expressly designated, as in the dedication of a chaplainry in Arngask (Scotland) in 1527, "for the praise, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the indivisible Trinity, the most glorious Virgin and <a href="../cathen/04136a.htm">St. Columba</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, our patron of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>". The celestial patronage here considered will be restricted in the first instance to <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>. Patrons in different countries generally present a distinctly national colouring; but the principles which have governed the selection of names will be made apparent by the examination of a few instances. In comparing place with place, the rank or precedence of patrons should be kept in view. A convenient arrangement will be the following:



<h4>Dedications</h4>

<ol><li>to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Sacred Humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> or its emblems; <li>to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>; <li>to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angels</a>; <li>to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> personages who introduced the New Law of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; <li>to the Apostles and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>; <li>to other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</ol>
<h3>Rome</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is illustrious for churches named after its local <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. The most important are the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter</a>, of <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul Outside the Walls</a>, of St. Lawrence, St. Sebastian, and of St. Agnes in the Via Nomentana. Other churches have received their title from the fact of being constructed in connexion with houses belonging to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in question: St. Clement's, St. Pudentiana's, St. Alexius's, St. Cecilia's, St. Praxedes's, St. Bartholomew's, Sts. John and Paul, St. Frances's of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Santa Croce recalls <a href="../cathen/07202b.htm">St. Helen</a>; the <em>Domine quo vadis</em> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> refers to the meeting of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> and St. Peter on the Appian Way; San Pietro in Carcere is erected above the <a href="../cathen/09579a.htm">Mamertine prison</a>; San Pietro in Montorio adjoins the place of St. Peter's <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>; San Pietro in Vincoli contains the actual chains with which St. Peter was bound. St. John Lateran's was first <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Saviour</a>, but the title was changed in the twelfth century; St. Gregory on the C&oelig;lian recalls the home of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> and the site of the church he built in honour of <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">St. Andrew</a>; St. Lorenzo in Damaso recalls its founder, <a href="../cathen/04614a.htm">Pope Damasus</a>. There are thirty-four churches <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, distinguished often topographically (as Sta Maria in Via lata, or Sta Maria in Trastevere) and also in other ways (as Sta Maria Maggiore, so called in relation to other Roman churches of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, Sta Maria della Pace, Sta Maria dell' Anima, etc.). The formal dedications to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> consist of Trinit&agrave; dei Pellegrini, Trinit&agrave; dei Monti, S. Spirito in Sassia, S. Salvatore in Lauro, S. Salvatore in Thermis, and the Gesu. There are no dedications to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">Angels</a> nor (until recently) to <a href="../cathen/13356b.htm">St. Joseph</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07163a.htm">Sacred Heart</a>, All Saints, or All Souls. In a few instances titulars occur more than once: Lawrence, 6; Peter, 4; Paul, Andrew, Charles, John, Nicholas, 3 each (see <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>).
<h3>England</h3>

<p>St. Augustine and his companions brought with them to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the Roman customs and traditions respecting the naming and dedication of churches. Altars were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> with the <a href="../cathen/01776c.htm">ashes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. One of the earliest dedication <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">Anglo-Saxon Church</a> runs thus: "Tibi, sancta Dei genitrix, virgo Maria (vel tibi, sancte J. B. Domini, . . . vel martyres Christi, vel confessores Domini) tibi commendamus hanc curam templi hujus, quod consecravimus Domino Deo nostro, ut hic intercessor existas; preces et vota offerentium hic Domino Deo offeras; odoramenta orationum plebis . . . ad patris thronum conferas", etc. (<a href="../cathen/09270c.htm">Lingard</a>, "The History and Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church", II 40). Among the titulars of the Anglo-Saxon period are found: Christ Church (Canterbury), St. Mary's de Comeliis, St. Mary's of Huntingdon, and of Lyming, All Hallows (Lincoln), Peter (to whom the greater part of the Anglo-Saxon churches were dedicated), Peter and Paul (Canterbury), Paul (Jarrow), Andrew (Rochester), Martin (near Canterbury), Pancratius (Canterbury). Accepting the figures of F. A. Foster in her "Studies in Church Dedications", and without drawing a line between pre-Reformation and post-Reformation English churches (not now <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>), we get the following enumeration of titulars: Christ 373, Holy Cross or Holy Rood 83, Michael, or Michael the Archangel, or St. Michael and the Angels 721 (one in six of the churches, ancient and modern, now attached to the Established Church bears the name of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> or one of her titles, the total being 2162, and the proportion in pre-Reformation times was still larger), John Baptist, 576; Peter, 936; Peter and Paul, 277; Paul, 329; <a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Holy Innocents</a>, 15; Helen, 117; <a href="../cathen/02081a.htm">Augustine of Canterbury</a>, 57; Thomas of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, 70; <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">Nicholas</a>, 397; Lawrence, 228. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> at the present time has shown the same spirit of conservatism and of independence which is everywhere manifested in the choice of patrons. Among the chief of the 170 dedications to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> (not counting <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a>, <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a>, or institutions), the numbers are: <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>, 16; Holy Cross, 15; Sacred Heart, 90. <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">Consecrations</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> maintain their ancient pre-eminence, reaching a total of 374. The simple designation of St. Mary's is the most frequent appellation. The form "Our Lady" occurs usually in combination with other titles. Among the numerous special titles are the following: Immaculate Conception, Our Lady of Sorrows, Help of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, Star of the Sea, Assumption, Our Lady of the Rosary. One church only bears the title of the Transfiguration, and one only is distinguished by each of the following titles: Our Lady of Refuge, of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, of Pity, of <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a>, of Reparation, of Reconciliation, Spouse of the Holy Ghost, Most Pure Heart of Mary. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are not favoured, Michael standing almost alone, but with 38 dedications. St. John Baptist has 20, while the name of Joseph appears as titular in no fewer than 145 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>. <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> reach a total of 153: Peter leads the way with 43; the Beloved Disciple counts his 30, Peter and Paul follow with 17. Each of the remaining Apostles has at least 2 churches under his invocation, except Matthias, Barnabas, and Mark, who have but 1. Among the male <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: <a href="../cathen/01556a.htm">Anthony of Padua</a>, <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">Charles</a>, Edward, <a href="../cathen/05293a.htm">Edmund</a>, George, and Richard have each between 10 and 20; but <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a>, with 46, heads the list; then follow Augustine 22, Benedict 19, <a href="../cathen/04579a.htm">Cuthbert</a> 18, and <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">Francis of Assisi</a> 21. A special interest attaches to names which occur but once, for frequently they are dedications to a local saint, as in the instances of <a href="../cathen/02578a.htm">Birinus</a> (Dorchester), Dubritius (Treforest), Gwladys (Newport, Mon.), Ia (<a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">St. Ives</a>), Neot (Liscard), <a href="../cathen/11349a.htm">Oswin</a> (Tynemouth), Prian (Truro), <a href="../cathen/14473b.htm">Teilo</a> (Tenby), <a href="../cathen/13800a.htm">Simon Stock</a> (Faversham), <a href="../cathen/06303b.htm">Frideswide</a> (Abingdon), and <a href="../cathen/15687a.htm">Walstan</a> (Cossey). Nothing could have been more appropriate than the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> names selected in the northern <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> corresponding with the ancient Northumbria. There we meet with dedications to <a href="../cathen/01233d.htm">Aidan</a>, <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, Bennet, Columba, Cuthbert, <a href="../cathen/11084a.htm">Ninian</a>, <a href="../cathen/07350a.htm">Hilda</a>, Oswald, etc. Among the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> <a href="../cathen/01538a.htm">Anne</a>, the mother of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, occupies a position of eminence with 30 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, Winefrid ranks next with 10, and Catherine follows with 8. The <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxon</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in the localities which they hallowed by their saintly lives, thus: Begh (Northumbria); <a href="../cathen/05554b.htm">Etheldreda</a> (Ely); Hilda (Whitby); Mildred (Minster); Modwena (Burtonon-Trent); Osberg (Coventry); <a href="../cathen/15588b.htm">Wereburg</a> (Chester); Winefrid (Holywell).
<h3>Scotland (Celtic and Medieval)</h3>

<p>In the days of the Picts, St. Peter was held in preference, from <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 710 when Roman usages were adopted, but Andrew claimed the greater number of dedications from the time his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> had been brought to the coast by St. Regulus. As instances of double titulars, native and foreign, the following may be taken: St. Mary and St. Manchar (Old Aberdeen); St. Mary and <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>; Sts. Mary and Peter; Madrustus and John Baptist; Stephen and Moanus. In pre-Reformation times <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> occurred less frequently than in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; the Holy Ghost is met with three times; many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> bore the title of Christ (Kilchrist, Kildomine); Holy Blood and Holy Rood are found in several instances. A <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> styled "Teampull-Cro-Naomh" (Temple of the Holy Heart) once stood on the shore at Gauslan in Lews. Numerous churches bore <a href="../cathen/09753a.htm">Our Lady's name</a> (Lady Kirk); the Assumption is found as early as 1290, and a church is dedicated to Our Lady of Loreto in 1530. Many churches had St. Michael for patron (Kilmichael). St. Anne is the titular in several places, and an altar to the Three Kings existed in almost every church. St. Joseph is nowhere found as a church titular, though he held the position of joint titular of an altar in 1518. The present day. &mdash; The choice of titulars in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> at the present time displays the same twofold direction that we find elsewhere: the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> and of other lands, and the promptings of modern devotion. The Sacred Heart has 8 dedications, the Holy Rood 3. The Apostles receive the special <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of 39 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, John being the patron of 13, and Andrew of 7. 77 churches are dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, of which 11 celebrate the Immaculate Conception, 7 bear the title of Star of the Sea; Our Lady of the Waves and Our Lady of Good Aid stand alone. Churches with the titles of modern <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are in a minority, for <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">Patrick</a> takes the lead with 12; Ninian, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland's</a> first apostle, has 6; Columba 5; <a href="../cathen/08620a.htm">Mungo</a> 4; <a href="../cathen/04640b.htm">David</a> 3; and Margaret 2. Many Celtic <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> occur but once, as for example, Bean, <a href="../cathen/02758c.htm">Brendan</a>, Cadoc, Columbkille, Fillian, Kessog, <a href="../cathen/08636b.htm">Kieran</a>, Mirin, and Winning.
<h3>Ireland</h3>

<p>The history of the patron saints of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> has yet to be written. The country has passed through long periods of trouble and oppression, yet several of the Celtic dedications have been preserved and linger in some districts even to this day. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church is often known simply by the name of the street in which it is situated, as the Cathedral, Marlborough St., <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> church in Gardiner Street. A similar instance occurs in Dublin with regard to the church dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, but always styled "Adam and Eve", from the fact that when the building was erected in the seventeenth century, there swung at the end of the alley, in which the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was situated, a public-house sign with the full figures of our <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">first parents</a>. The two <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">religious edifices</a> in a town are sometimes called the "Cathedral" and the "Old Chapel". In the days of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, when churches and endowments had alike been confiscated, the <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship recalled the secrecy of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>. During the nineteenth century the old "barns" that had so long served for <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> were replaced by beautiful and spacious churches for which <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were frequently selected as patrons; but as a rule the choice has been determined by the tendencies of modern devotion. There are dedications to the Sacred Heart, to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> under her various titles, and to many of the more recently <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, such as St. Vincent and <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>. Still the people continue to refer to the churches by the names of the streets. In Celtic times man churches were dedicated to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> and called Kilmurray. All the Donaghmore (<em>Dominica Major</em>) churches were dedicated to <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, because they had been founded by him. Other dedications include Bridget (Kilbride), Peter (Kilpedder), Paul (Kilpool), <a href="../cathen/03445a.htm">Catherine of Alexandria</a> (Killadreenan, Kilcatherine). The <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">Holy Sepulchre</a> found a place among the oldest dedications. In Dublin or the neighbourhood the titles of Peter, Bride Martin, <a href="../cathen/04092c.htm">Kevin</a>, McTail (St. Michael-lePole), <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">Nicholas</a> within and <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">Nicholas</a> without the walls, were to be met with. Then there were churches under the patronage of All Hallows, Macud (Kilmacud), Machonna, <a href="../cathen/06078a.htm">Fintan</a>, Brendan (Carrickbrenan), Begnet (St. Bega, Kilbegnet), Gobhain (Kilgobbin), Tiernan (Kilter, Kilternan). Bern's church was so called because founded by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Byrne's clan. The title of Cell-Ingen-Leinin (Church of the five daughters of Leinin, whence the name Killiney) was so called from its founders. New names were introduced by the Normans, as Audven (Dublin), being <a href="../cathen/11360b.htm">St. Ouen</a> of. Rouen. The colony from <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>, brought over to repeople Dublin which had been decimated by the plague at the end of the twelfth century, erected a church dedicated to their patroness, St. Werburg.
<h3>Continental Europe</h3>

<p>With regard to the patrons of churches on the continent of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> it must suffice to mention that in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> alone there are 3000 dedications under the invocation of <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin</a>, and then to take a glance at the single <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>: <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> is the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of an old country that has never lost the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Its churches have 95 titulars which are distributed as follows: <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> 1; Holy Redeemer 2; Sacred Heart 3; Exaltation of the Holy Cross 3; <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> (Notre Dame) 24; Immaculate Conception 4; Assumption 6; Nativity 4. Michael holds the patronage of 7 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, Joseph of 5, and <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> of 16: Seven of the Apostles are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with 63 dedications: Peter has 23; Peter's Chains 3; Paul 5; Conversion of Paul 2; Bartholomew 6; James 6; and John only 3. Every town and district of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> is hallowed with the traditions of the holy men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of ancient days, so that the devotion shown to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of other countries is not a little remarkable. Out of 57 male <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> adopted as titulars Martin has the highest number, namely 20; <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">Nicholas</a> 13; Lawrence 8; <a href="../cathen/02592a.htm">Blaise</a> 6. Amand, Apostle of the Flemings, has been chosen patron of 19 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, Audomar of 8; Bavo, the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, of 7; <a href="../cathen/05386a.htm">Eligius</a> of 10; Medard of 6; and <a href="../cathen/15248a.htm">Vaast</a> of 4.
<h3>United States</h3>

<p>The fourteen <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archdioceses</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> have been examined as affording suitable material for a study of local <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, namely, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, New York, <a href="../cathen/11293a.htm">Oregon City</a>, Philadelphia, St. Louis, St. Paul, <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, and Santa F&eacute;. Over this area are found some 300 churches under dedications of the first rank, the principal ones being here enumerated: <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Most Holy Trinity</a> 27; Holy Ghost 10; Holy Redeemer 11; Sacred Heart 109; <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> (including <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> 4, <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> 1) 14; <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Holy Name</a> 12; Holy Cross 19. The life of Christ is adequately represented, thus: <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">Incarnation</a> 3; Nativity 9; <a href="../cathen/05504c.htm">Epiphany</a> 3; Transfiguration 4; <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> 3; <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> 9. Other titles may be mentioned: Holy Spirit 3; Gesu 2; Atonement, Good Shepherd, Holy Comforter, Holy Saviour, <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Providence of God</a>, St. Sauveur, and Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary 1 each. With the increasing realization of the <a href="../cathen/06553a.htm">gifts</a> of the Incarnation which appears in modern devotions, it will excite little wonder that some 500 or more churches are dedicated to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> under one or other of her many titles, the principal being: St. Mary 148; Immaculate Conception 105; Assumption 36; <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Holy Rosary</a> 19; <a href="../cathen/01541c.htm">Annunciation</a> 12; Visitation 10; Star of the Sea 9; Presentation 6; Nativity 5; Holy Name of Mary 3; Maternity 3; <a href="../cathen/07168a.htm">Immaculate Heart of Mary</a> 2; <a href="../cathen/03245b.htm">Purification</a> 2; Most Pure Heart of Mary 1. Titles from the <a href="../cathen/09287a.htm">Litany of Loreto</a> attract in so far as they represent the more recent expressions of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> devotion, thus: <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a> 2; Mother of Divine Grace 1; Our Lady of Good Counsel 10; Gate of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> 1; Help of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> 13; Queen of the Angels 1; Our Lady of the Angels 6; Our Lady of the Rosary 11. With the foregoing list certain derivative titles may be connected: Our Lady of Consolation 6; of Good Voyage 1; of Grace 3; of Help 2; of Mercy 4; of Perpetual Help 10; of Pity 2; of <a href="../cathen/11699b.htm">Prompt Succour</a> 1; of Refuge 1; of Solace 1; of Sorrows 6; of the Lake 5; of the Sacred Heart 3; of the Seven Dolours 5; of the Snow 1; of Victory 8. The following geographical determinations occur: Our Lady of Czestochowa 4; of <a href="../cathen/07043a.htm">Guadalupe</a> 8; of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> 2; of Loreto 4; of Mount Cannel 22; of Lourdes 14; of Pompeii 4; of <a href="../cathen/15432a.htm">Vilna</a> 2. Notre Dame de Bon Port, du Bon Secours, de <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, de la Paix, Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Belen, <a href="../cathen/12083b.htm">del Pilar</a>, Sancta Maria Addolorata, and Sancta Maria Incoronata, 1 each, suggest French, Spanish, and Italian affiliations.

<p>The list of male <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in the fourteen <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> comprises 156 names, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> 41. For the sake of convenience these have been divided into groups. 10 churches are dedicated to All Saints, the Apostles in general have 1; Peter, the Prince of the Apostles, 58; James 26; Andrew 15; Thomas 11; Matthias 5; Philip 5; Barnabas 3; Bartholomew 2; <a href="../cathen/08542b.htm">Jude</a> 1; the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a> have: John 59; Matthew 13; Mark 9; <a href="../cathen/09420a.htm">Luke</a> 6.

Among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, more than in any other class, the nationality of devotion finds occasion for its manifestation. Celtic centres are shown by such titles as: Brendan 5; <a href="../cathen/03250a.htm">Canice</a> 1; Colman 3; Columba 5; <a href="../cathen/04137a.htm">Columbanus</a> 2; Columbkille 6; <a href="../cathen/04514d.htm">Cronan</a> 1; <a href="../cathen/06076a.htm">Finbar</a> 1; <a href="../cathen/08323c.htm">Jarlath</a> 1; Kevin 1; <a href="../cathen/08639a.htm">Kilian</a> 3; <a href="../cathen/09091b.htm">Lawrence O'Toole</a> 3; <a href="../cathen/09565a.htm">Malachy</a> 6; Mel 1; <a href="../cathen/02062d.htm">Attracta</a> 1; Bridget 11; <a href="../cathen/08201c.htm">Ita</a> 1; George, a widely favoured national patron, has 17 churches. <a href="../cathen/13064a.htm">Rita of Cascia</a> 3, and Rocco 2, show the Italian; <a href="../cathen/09416a.htm">Ludmilla</a> 1, Procopius 1, and <a href="../cathen/15490b.htm">Vitus</a> 1, are <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a>; Stephen with 23 suggests <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>; <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> with 21 dedications, and Henry with 8, tell of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>.

<h3>Canada</h3>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Dominion of Canada</a>, to a very great extent, the name of a district or village is the same as that of the patron of the church. Obviously the different localities have been named after their respective patrons. The number of titulars is considerable, the names having been assigned on the plan of avoiding repetitions. In the list examined the names of about 400 male, and 100 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a>, <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are represented, and the entire range of popular devotion is covered. It is a surprise to find that in this long list of provincial divisions no dedications are to be found to the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Most Holy Trinity</a>, the Holy Ghost, the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>.

<h2>Patrons of countries</h2>

<p>An <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authentic</a> catalogue of patron saints of countries of the world has yet to be made. Some countries appear to have no celestial patron, others have several assigned to them, and it is by no means clear that the distinction between patron and Apostle is invariably taken into account. The following list gives the patrons of some few countries of the world: <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> (<a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>), <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> (St. Joseph), <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> (declared "The Land of the Holy Cross", 3 May, 1500), <a href="../cathen/02687a.htm">Borneo</a> (<a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a>), <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> (St. Anne and <a href="../cathen/06453a.htm">St. George</a>), The <a href="../cathen/04228a.htm">Congo</a> (<a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our lady</a>), <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chili</a> (St. James), <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (St. George), East Indies (St. Thomas, Apostle), <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a> (styled "The Republic of the Sacred Heart"), <a href="../cathen/06076d.htm">Finland</a> (Henry of Upsal), <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (St. Denis), <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (St. Michael), <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> (<a href="../cathen/15645a.htm">St. Willibrord</a>), <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (St. Stephen), <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> (<a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>), <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (various), <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> (<a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles</a>), Mexico (Our Lady of Help, and Our Lady of Guadaloupe), <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> (<a href="../cathen/11234a.htm">St. Olaf</a>), <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> (St. George), <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a> (<a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a>), <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> (St. Andrew), <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> (<a href="../cathen/02782a.htm">St. Bridget</a>), <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (St. James), South America (<a href="../cathen/13192c.htm">St. Rose of Lima</a>), <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of North America</a> (<a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> under the title of Immaculate Conception), <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> (<a href="../cathen/04640b.htm">St. David</a>).
<h2>Patrons of trades and professions</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in an age of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> prompted him to place not only his churches under the protection of some illustrious servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the ordinary interests of life, his health, and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, trade, maladies, and perils, his death, his city and country. The whole social life of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> was animated with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of protection from the citizens of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. It has been stated that in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> there existed 40,000 religious corporations, including <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> bodies of all kinds, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a>, industrial and professional <a href="../cathen/07066c.htm">guilds</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a>, each of which had its patron, its rites, funds, and methods of assistance. Some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the vastness of the subject may be gathered from a few examples of the trades under their respective patrons: Anastasia (weavers), Andrew (fishermen), Anne (houseworkers and cabinet-makers), Christopher (porters), Cloud (nailmakers), <a href="../cathen/04403e.htm">Cosmas and Damian</a> (doctors), <a href="../cathen/10317b.htm">Crispin</a> (shoemakers), Eloi (all workers with the hammer), Hubert (huntsmen), Lydia (dyers), Joseph (carpenters), Mark (notaries), Luke (painters), Nativity (trades for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>), <a href="../cathen/12671b.htm">Raymund Nonnatus</a> (<a href="../cathen/10287a.htm">midwives</a>), <a href="../cathen/12671c.htm">Raymund of Pennafort</a> (canonists), Stephen (stonemasons), Vincent Martyr (winegrowers), Vitus (comedians). Conditions of life: <a href="../cathen/06159a.htm">foundlings</a> (<a href="../cathen/07419a.htm">Holy Innocents</a>), girls (Blandina), boys (Aloysius), singers and scholars (<a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>), <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> (Catherine), musicians (Cecilia), <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> (Dismas). There were patrons or protectors in various forms of illness, as for instance: <a href="../cathen/01203c.htm">Agatha</a> (diseases of the breast), <a href="../cathen/01617c.htm">Apollonia</a> (toothache), Blaise (sore throat), Clare and Lucy (the eyes), Benedict (against poison), Hubert (against the bite of dogs). These patrons with very many others were chosen on account of some real correspondence between the patron and the object of patronage, or by reason of some play on words, or as a matter of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individual</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Thus, while the great special patrons had their clients all over <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, other patrons in regard of the same class of objects might vary with different times and places.

<p>In order to complete this imperfect and summary sketch of the subject of patrons, a list of the patrons announced by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> within the last few years should here find a place: St. Joseph was declared patron of the universal Church by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> on 8 December, 1870. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> during the course of his pontificate announced the following patrons: <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, patron of all <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, colleges, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> (4 August, 1880); St. Vincent, patron of all <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> (1 May, 1885); <a href="../cathen/03217b.htm">St. Camillus of Lellis</a>, patron of the sick and of those who attend on them (22 June, 1886); the patronal <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of Our Lady of the Congo to be the Assumption (21 July, 1891); St. Bridget, patroness of <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> (1 October, 1861); the Holy Family, the model and help of all <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm#christian">Christian families</a> (14 June, 1892); St. Peter Claver, special patron of missions to the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> (1896); <a href="../cathen/11512a.htm">St. Paschal Baylon</a>, patron of <a href="../cathen/05592a.htm">Eucharistic congresses</a> and all Eucharistic <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> (28 November, 1897). On 25 May, 1899, he dedicated the world to the Sacred Heart, as Prince and Lord of all, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and non-Catholics, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and non-Christians. Lourdes was dedicated to our Lady of the Rosary (8 September, 1901). <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> declared <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> patron of the Propagation of the Faith (25 March, 1904).

<p>The honouring of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> has in some instances doubtless been the occasion of abuse. Spells and incantations have been intruded in the place of trust and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; the prayerful abstinence of a <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigil</a> has been exchanged for the rollicksome enjoyment of wakes; reverence may have run incidentally to puerile extravagance; and patrons may have been chosen before their claim to an <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic exercise of Christian virtue</a> had been juridically established. Still it remains <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the manifestation of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> paid to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> has been singularly free from the taint of human excess and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.
