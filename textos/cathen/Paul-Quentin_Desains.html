<h1>Paul-Quentin Desains</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">Physicist</a>, b. at St-Quentin, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 12 July, 1817; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 3 May, 1885. He made his literary studies at the Coll&egrave;ge des Bons-Enfants in his native town and then entered the Lyc&eacute;e Louis-le-Grand in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Here he distinguished himself, taking the first prize in physics. In 1835 he entered the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> section of the Ecole Normale where his brother Edouard had preceded him. He made the acquaintance there of La Provostaye who was at the time a <em>surveillant</em> and who became his lifelong friend and his associate in his researches. After completing his course, he accepted a professorship in 1839 at <a href="../cathen/03132a.htm">Caen</a>, and in 1841 returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> where he received similar appointments, first at the Lyc&eacute;e St-Louis and later at the Lyc&eacute;e Condorcet, where he succeeded La Provostaye who was forced to retire on account of ill-health. His growing <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> won for him in 1853 the chair of physics at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a> which he held for thirty-two years. His lectures were characterized by great clearness and precision and many of his experimental illustrations were devised or improved by him.

<p>Between 1858 and 1861 he made many observations in connexion with terrestrial magnetism. His most important contributions to <a href="../cathen/12047a.htm">physics</a>, however, were his researches on radiant heat made in conjunction with La Provostaye. With rare experimental skill the two physicists <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that radiant heat, like light,, is a disturbance set up in the ether and propagated in all directions by transverse waves. They showed in a series of "M&eacute;moires" published in the "Annals de Chimie etde Physique" that it manifests the characteristic phenomena of reflection, refraction, and polarization, as well as of emission and absorption. They also made a study of the latent heat of fusion of ice, and a careful investigation of the range of applicability of the formula of Dulong and Petit representing the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of cooling. Of no less importance, however, was Desain's work in connexion with the establishment and development of laboratory instruction in physics. When the "Ecole pratique des hautes &eacute;tudes" was founded in 1869 he was commissioned to organize the physical laboratory. He made it a model of its kind both in completeness and in convenience of detail. During the siege of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1870, he succeeded after many difficulties in establishing electrical communication with d'Alm&eacute;ida who was outside the lines. The exposure he underwent brought on a rheumatism which greatly weakened his constitution. Desains published a "Traite&eacute;de Physique" (Paris, 1855) and numerous articles, chiefly with La Provostaye. Among them are: "Recherches sur la chaleur latente de fusion de la glace" (Ann. de chim. et de phys. [3], VIII, 5); "Notes et m&eacute;moires sur les lois du rayonnement de la chaleur" (ibid., XII, 129, XVI, 337, XXII, 358); "M&eacute;moire sur la polarisation de la chaleur" (ibid., XXVII, 109, 232, XXVIII, 252, XXX, 159); "M&eacute;moire sur les anneaux color&eacute;s" (ibid., XXX, 276); "M&eacute;moires sur la d&eacute;termination du pouvoir absorbant des corps pour la chaleur rayonnante" (XXX, 431); etc.
