<h1>Paul Heliae</h1>  

<p>(POVL HELGESEN)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, opponent of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, born at Warberg (in the Laen of Halland), about 1480; died after 1534, place unknown, In early youth he entered the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of his native town, where he received his first <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and in course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> obtained the degrees of Lecturer on <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and Bachelor of Divinity; he was elected provincial in 1519 and soon after professor at the <a href="../cathen/04352a.htm">University of Copenhagen</a>. In these positions he had to choose sides in the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> strife which broke out on the appointment of a <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Nicholas, and the introduction of a new <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> code of distinctly <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> tendencies. In a sermon preached at court he warmly defended the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and made some pointed remarks on the king's <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, with the result that he had to seek safety in flight until the dethronement of Christian II and the election of Frederick I procured a short respite to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. Unfortunately Helgesen through misdirected <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, rendered his own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> suspect; he preached against <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> vices with a vehemence peculiar to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> invectives, and also published a <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> translation of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> "Betb&uuml;chlein" (<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> book on the commandments, the Creed, the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Father</a> and Hail Mary); his object in placing <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> work before the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> was evidently to eliminate what was unsound in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and to preserve only that which agreed with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; yet, owing to hurry, Helgesen allowed much to pass which should have been omitted, and failed to emphasize some of the most important <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>.

<p>The result was that both <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> remained for some time uncertain as to his real <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, and afterwards, when his attitude <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> him to be an uncompromising adherent of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, he was nicknamed <em>Vendekaabe</em> (weathercock), under which name he went down to posterity. Nevertheless he missed no occasion to attack <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, writing no less than six works in defence of the old <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and taking part in public disputations. But all in vain; protected by the king (in flagrant violation of his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>), and fostered both by <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and Sweden, the new religion grew every day more powerful; <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship was gradually abolished, and Helgesen had the sorrow to see the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of his order secularized. Nothing is known concerning his last days; Schmitt inclines to think that he met with a violent death during or after the siege of <a href="../cathen/16071c.htm">Roskilde</a> (1536), and thus gained a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> crown; others are of opinion that he may have withdrawn to some <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> abroad, perhaps in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>.
