<h1>Paul Melchers</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, b. 6 Jan., 1813, at <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>; d. 14 December, 1895, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a> (1830-33), and a few years practice at <a href="../cathen/10634b.htm">M&uuml;nster</a>, took up <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> under <a href="../cathen/08666a.htm">Klee</a>, G&ouml;rres, Windischmann and <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> in 1841, he was assigned to <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> in the village of Haltren. In 1844 he became vice-rector of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> (1851), canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> (1852), <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> (1854). <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a> (1857) and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> (1966). Here he laboured <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> and, moreover, inaugurated (1867) at <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, those annual reunions of the German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> which have since produced such excellent results. Though he had always accepted and taught the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>, he regarded its formal definition as untimely, a conviction which he, with thirteen other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, expressed in a letter to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, 4 Sept., 1869. At the same time, however, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, in a pastoral letter which they signed without ex ception, warned the faithful against reports unfavourable to the future (Vatican) Council and exhorted them to await calmly its decisions. In the Council itself Archbishop Melchers took a prominent part. At the session of 13 July, 1870, he voted negatively on the question of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a>; but he refused to sign an address in which fifty-five other members of the minority notified the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of their immediate departure and reiterated their non placet. He left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> before the fourth solemn session, giving as his reason the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and declaring his readiness to abide by the decisions of the Council. On his return to Cologne he proclaimed in an elegant address (24 July) the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> defined 18 July. As a means of insuring obedience to the Council, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled by him at <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, published (1 Sept.) a joint letter, which produced a deep and salutary impression, and for which <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> (20 Oct.) expressed his gratitude to Archbishop Melchers. To eliminate the opposition at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> (20 Sept. and 8 Oct.) called on professors <a href="../cathen/04786c.htm">Dieringer</a>, Reusch, Langen, and Knoodt to sign a declaration accepting the Vatican <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> and pledging conformity thereto in their teaching. <a href="../cathen/04786c.htm">Dieringer</a> alone complied; the others were suspended and eventually (12 March, 1872) <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.

<p>The encroachment and repressive measures of the <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a> were firmly resisted by Archbishop Melchers. In June, 18973, he <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who had joined the <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a>; for this and other administrative acts he was fined and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for six months (12 March-Oct., 1874). On 2 December, 1875, the President of the Rhine Province demanded his resignation on pain of deposition; he refused, but learning that preparations were being made to deport him to K&uuml;strin he escaped (13 Dec.) to Maestritch and took refuge with the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. From their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> he administered his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> for ten years. Knowing, however, the temper of the German Government, and fearing that his absence from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> would prove injurious to religion, he on different occasions informed <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> of his willingness to resign for the general good. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at last reluctantly consented, but called him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> (27 July, 1885). In 1892 during a serious illness he was received into the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> and lived as a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> until his death three years later. He was laid to rest in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Cologne amidst obsequies that attested to the people's admiration and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. St. Paul's church in the same city, completed in 1908, fittingly commemorates Melcher's heroic struggle for the liberty of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>His principal publications are: "Erinnerungen An die Feier des 50 j&auml;hrigen Bischofsjubil&auml;ums des h. Vaters Pius IX" (Cologne, 1876); "Eine Unterweisung &uuml;ber das Gebet" (Cologne, 1876); "Einer Unterweisung &uuml;ber des heilige Messopfer" (Cologne, 1879); "Das Sendschriben des heilige Vaters Papst Leo XIII &uuml;ber den Socialismus" (Cologne, 1880); "Die katholiche Lehre von der Kirche" (Cologne, 1881); "Das enine Nothwendige" (Cologne, 1882); "De canonica dioecesium visitatione" (Rome, 1892).
