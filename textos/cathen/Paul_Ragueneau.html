<h1>Paul Ragueneau</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary, b. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 18 March, 1608; d. 8 Sept., 1680. He entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in 1626. In 1636 he went to Quebec and was soon sent to the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Hurons</a> with <a href="../cathen/09149a.htm">Le Moyne</a>, Depron, Jogues, and <a href="../cathen/06388b.htm">Garnier</a>, to labour under Br&eacute;beuf during the long and painful period preceding the conversion of that nation. He was one of the heroic band who, in 1637, being exposed to death at every moment, signed and sent to their superior as their last will a joint act of resignation to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. In 1645 Ragueneau was superior of the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> mission which counted eighteen workers. He possessed a perfect mastery of the language. The death of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Jogues was the signal for many conversions, and Ragueneau writes with admiration of the fervour of his <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a>. Five of his fellow missionaries won the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> crown in different posts under Ragueneau's direction, the first being Father Daniel (4 July, 1648). He remained at his post on St. Mary's on the Wye until persuaded by the <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> captains to join the fugitives on St. Joseph's island (1649). The notable increase in the number of conversions (3000 Indians being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in 1649) rewarded his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. After a bloody defeat, followed by the massacres of Fathers <a href="../cathen/03551a.htm">Chabanel</a> and <a href="../cathen/06388b.htm">Garnier</a>, Ragueneau, yielding to the entreaties of the few whom famine, pestilence, and the fury of the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> had spared, led the small band of 400 survivors, the remnants of a nation of ten thousand, to their final refuge, Quebec, after a long and perilous journey. In 1650 he became vice <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the College of Quebec and superior of the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> mission. It was during this time that he directed in the ways of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> a highly privileged <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, Sister Catherine of St-Augustine, whose life he wrote. His influence in the supreme council and with <a href="../cathen/09043a.htm">Governor de Lauzon</a> was the occasion of his removal to <a href="../cathen/14708a.htm">Three Rivers</a> (1656). The year following he was sent as superior to the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> mission. On his way to Onondaga he witnessed the butchery of his <a href="../cathen/07565a.htm">Huron</a> companions, for which he reproved the murderers, the Senecas and Onondagas, at the peril of his own life. Informed of the impending massacre of all the French in the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> country, Ragueneau's genius planned and realized their escape and return to Quebec (1658). He returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1662) with Bishop Laval, and remained there as <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of the missions. Besides a life of Sister Catherine of St-Augustine (Paris, 1671), Ragueneau wrote "Relations" of 1648-9, 1649-50, 1650-1, and 1651-2. No other <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> wrote so much as he. On one of his missions he saw and mentioned Niagara Falls thirty-five years before <a href="../cathen/07215c.htm">Hennepin</a>, the alleged discoverer, described the cataract.
