<h1>Paul of Burgos</h1>  

<p>(PAUL DE SANTA MARIA; Jewish name, SOLOMON HA-LEVI)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, lord chancellor and <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a> about 1351; died 29 Aug., 1435. He was the most wealthy and influential <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, a scholar of the first rank in Talmudic and rabbinical literature, and a Rabbi of the Jewish community. The irresistible <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> of the <a href="../summa/index.html">Summa</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> led him to the Faith of Christ. He received Baptism, 21 July, 1390. His brothers Pedro Suares and Alvar Garcia, together with his daughter and four boys, aged from three to twelve years, were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with him. His wife Joanna died a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewess</a> shortly after. Paul de Santa Maria, as he was called, spent some years at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, where he took his degree of doctor in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. His sincerity, keen insight into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, thorough <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and soul-stirring eloquence marked him out as a prominent churchman of the future. In 1405 he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03384b.htm">Cartagena</a>; in 1415, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>. In 1416 King Henry of Castile named him lord chancellor. After the king's death Archbishop Paul was a member of the council which ruled Castile in the name of the regent Do&ntilde;a Catalina, and by the will of the deceased king he was tutor to the heir to the throne &#151; later John II of Castile. The published writings of Archbishop Paul were: <ol><li>"Dialogus Pauli et Sauli contra Jud&aelig;os, sive Scrutinium scripturarum" (Mantua, 1475; Mains, 1478; Paris, 1507, 1535; Burgos, 1591). <li>"Additiones" to the "Postilla" of <a href="../cathen/11063a.htm">Nicholas of Lyra</a> (Nuremberg, 1481; 1485; 1487, etc.; Venice, 1481, 1482, etc.). It is chiefly on the latter work that Paul's reputation as an <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a> rests. The "Additiones" were originally mere marginal notes written in a volume of the "Postilla" which he sent to his son Alfonso. Their publication aroused Matthias D&ouml;ring, the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the Saxon <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, to publish his "Replic&aelig;", a bitter rejection of almost half of the 1100 suggestions and additions Paul had made. The converted <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> was superior to <a href="../cathen/11063a.htm">Nicholas of Lyra</a> in Hebrew, but not in Biblical interpretations; in fact, Paul <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> in not admitting an inspired allegorical meaning of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a>, prejudiced against it, no doubt, by the extravagance of Talmudic allegorical fancies. <li>"De nomine divino qu&aelig;stiones duodecim" (Utrecht, 1707). These tracts are excerpts from the "Additiones" in regard to <a href="../bible/exo003.htm">Exodus 3</a>, and are joined to the <em>scholia</em> of J. Drusius on the correct pronunciation of the name of Jahweh.</ol>

<p>Archbishop Paul was succeeded in the See of Burgos by his second son, <a href="../cathen/01309b.htm">Alfonso</a>.
