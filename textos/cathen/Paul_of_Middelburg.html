<h1>Paul of Middelburg</h1>  

<p>A scientist and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, born in 1446 at Middelburg, the ancient capital of the province of Zealand, belonging then to the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, now to <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>; died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 13 December, 1534. After finishing his studies in <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> he received a <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">canonry</a> in his native town, of which he was afterwards deprived. The circumstances of this fact are not known, but in his apologetic letter on the celebration of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> he calls it a usurpation, and shows great bitterness against his country, calling it "barbara Zelandi&aelig; insula", "vervecum patria", "cerdonum regio", etc. He then taught for a while in <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, was invited by the Signoria of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to take a chair for <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> in Padua (1480), travelled through <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, became physician to Francesco Maria della Rovere, Duke of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, and friend to Maximilian, Archduke of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, afterwards emperor. By the former he was endowed with the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey St. Christophorus in Castel Durante (1488), and by the latter he was recommended to <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> for the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/06154b.htm">Fossombrone</a> (Moroni, LXXXV, 314). Being nominated to that see, in 1494, he destroyed some of his former publications; first "Giudizio dell' anno 1480", in which he had censured a number of mathematicians; then a "Practica de pravis Constellationibus", and a defence of that work against the nephew of <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> (1484); and finally an "Invectiva in superstitiosum Vatem". He chose for himself an <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">coat of arms</a>, and, in 497, enlarged and embellished the episcopal palace. Besides some smaller treatises against <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usurers</a> and against the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> fear of a flood in 1524 (Fossombrone, 1523), he wrote important works on the reform of the Calendar, which procured for him invitations by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> and <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09018b.htm">Fifth Lateran Council</a> (1512-1518). His "Epistola ad Universitatem Lovaniensem de Paschate recte observando" (1487) was followed by an "Epistola apologetica" (1488), and finally by his principal work "Paulina, de recta Pasch celebratione" (Fossombrone, 1513). The contents and result of the work are described under the article LILIUS. He died while assisting at the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in S. Maria dell' Anima. His family name is unknown, but in one place he is called Paolo di Adriano (Moroni, XLIV, 120). <a href="../cathen/13506a.htm">Scaliger</a>, who calls him "Omnium sui s&aelig;culi mathematicorum . . . facile princeps", was his godson.
