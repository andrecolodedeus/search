<h1>Paul of Samosata</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. Several <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, probably three, were held against him about 264-66. <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">St. Dionysius of Alexandria</a> had desired to attend the first of these, but was prevented by his infirmities. Firmilian of C&aelig;sarea, <a href="../cathen/07015a.htm">St. Gregory Thaumaturgus</a>, his brother Athenodorus, and many others, were present. Paul held the civil office of <em>Procurator ducenarius,</em> and was protected by Zenobia, the famous Queen of <a href="../cathen/11433a.htm">Palmyra</a>. He was a wealthy man, and had many obsequious followers among neighbouring <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Many defended his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, and he declared himself <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. In the first meetings the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were satisfied. At another Paul was condemned, but promised to retract his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. This he failed to do. A final council was summoned. Firmilian died on the way to it. The principal part was taken by a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Antioch, Malchion, who was an accomplished man of letters and head of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Greek literature at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, In disputation with Paul he plainly convicted him of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and procured his deposition. A letter written by Malchion in the name of the synod and addressed to Pope <a href="../cathen/05009b.htm">Dionysius of Rome</a>, Maximus of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> throughout the world, has been preserved by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> in part; a few fragments only remain of the shorthand report of the disputation.

<p>The letter accuses Paul of acquiring great wealth by illicit means, of showing haughtiness and worldliness, of having set up for himself a lofty <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> in the church, and of insulting those who did not applaud him and wave their handkerchiefs, and so forth. He had caused <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> by admitting <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to live in his house, and had permitted the same to his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Paul could not be driven from his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> until the emperor <a href="../cathen/02108b.htm">Aurelian</a> took possession of Antioch in 272. Even then he refused to vacate the house belonging to the church. An appeal was made to <a href="../cathen/02108b.htm">Aurelian</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> emperor, who was at this time favourable to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, decided most justly, says <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (vii, 30, 19), that the house should be given up to those to whom the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> should write; &mdash; evidently it had been argued before him that the question of legitimacy depended on communion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to be granted after examination by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and his council. Paul was driven out in utter disgrace by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>. Of his life no more is known to us. His <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was akin to the dynamistic <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Monarchianism</a> of Theodotus, and he was nicknamed a follower of <a href="../cathen/01755a.htm">Artemas</a>. We can gather these points: the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are but a single Person (<em>prosopon</em>). The Son or Logos is without hypostasis, being merely the wisdom and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is in Him as reason is in a man. Before all worlds He was born as Son (<em>Logos prophorikos</em>) without a virgin; he is without shape and cannot be made visible to men. He worked in the Prophets, especially in Moses (let us remember that Zenobia was a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewess</a>, and that this monarchianism may have been intended to please her), and in a far higher way in the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Son of David</a> who was born by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> of a Virgin. The Christ, the Saviour, is essentially a man, but the Holy Ghost inspired Him from above. The Father and the Son are one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereas Christ is from the earth with a <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> of his own. Thus there are two Persons in Christ. The Logos as Wisdom dwelt in the man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, as we live in houses, and worked in Him as inspiration, teaching Him and being with Him, and was united with Him not substantially (or essentially, <em>ousiodos</em>), but qualitatively (<em>kata poioteta</em>). Mary did not bring forth the Word, for she did not exist before the worlds, but a man like to us. Paul denied the inference that there are two Sons. The Son of the Virgin is great by Wisdom, who dwelt in no other so.

<p>Union of two Persons is possible only by agreement of will, issuing in unity of action, and originating by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. By this kind of union Christ had merit; He could have had none had the union been by nature. By the unchangeableness of His will He is like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was united to Him by remaining pure from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. By striving and suffering He conquered the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of our first parent, and was joined to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being one with Him in intention and action. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> worked in Him to do <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in order to prove Him the Redeemer and Saviour of the race. By the ever growing and never ceasing movement of friendship He has joined Himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> so that He can never be separated through all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and His Name is above every Name as a reward of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Judgment is made over to Him; He may be called "God from the Virgin", "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>". He is said to have pre-existed, but this means by <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> only. The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as usual was regarded by Paul as a step in His junction with the Logos. If He had been <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by nature, Paul argued, there would be two Gods. He forbade <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> to Christ, and openly attacked the older (Alexandrian) interpretations of Scripture.

<p>The party of Paul did not at once disappear. The <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> declared the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> conferred by the Paulianists to be invalid. There is something, though not much, of his teaching in the Lucianist and <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> systems which issued from Antioch. But their <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a> was the very opposite of his, which was rather to reappear in a modified form in <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, Diodorus, Nestorius, and even Theodoret, though these later Antiochenes warmly rejected the imputation of any agreement with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> Paul, even in <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a>.

<p>It must be regarded as certain that the council which condemned Paul rejected the term <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousios</a></em>; but naturally only in a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> sense used by Paul; not, it seems because he meant by it an unity of Hypostasis in the Trinity (so St. Hilary), but because he intended by it a common substance out of which both Father and Son proceeded, or which it divided between them, &mdash; so <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> and <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a>; but the question is not clear. The objectors to the Nicene <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in the fourth century made copious use of this disapproval of the Nicene word by a famous council.

<p>The fragments are best collected by Routh, "Rell. SS.", III. Further fragments in Pitra, "Analecta sacra", III-IV. The letter of St. Dionysius is spurious. That of six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to Paul is usually rejected, but Harnack thinks it genuine, following Hagemann.
