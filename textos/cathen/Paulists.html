<h1>Paulists</h1>  

<p>From the time that the abode and virtues of <a href="../cathen/11590b.htm">St. Paul</a> the first <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> were revealed to St. Anthony, various communities of <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> adopted him as patron. The name Paulists, however, was also applied to the members of congregations established under the patronage of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul the Apostle</a>. (See the articles on <a href="../cathen/02302a.htm">BARNABITES</a>; MINIMS; PIARISTS; and <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">THEATINES</a>.)
<h2 id="section1">Hermits of St. Paul of Hungary</h2>

<p>Formed in 1250 by Blessed Eusebius of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>, of two communities, one founded at Patach in 1215 by Bishop Bartholomew of Pecs who united the scattered <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and the other consisting of his own followers. In 1246 Blessed Eusebius, canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>, resigned his dignities, distributed his goods among the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and withdrew to the solitude of Pisilia, a forest near <a href="../cathen/15750a.htm">Zante</a>, to lead a life of penance with a few companions. Four years later he is said to have been admonished in a vision to gather into community the other <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> living in the vicinity, for whom he built a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and church. In the same year he proposed and obtained affiliation with the Patach community under the rule prescribed by its founder, and was chosen superior. He received the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of Ladislaus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pecs, for the new congregation, but the publication of the decrees of the Lateran Council at this time necessitated a journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to secure the further sanction of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In 1263 a new rule was given the congregation by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pecs, which was superseded by still another drawn up by Andrew, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01230a.htm">Agria</a>, after the death of Eusebius (20 Jan., 1270), and this was followed until 1308, when the permission of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was obtained to adopt the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>. The order was accorded many privileges by succeeding pontiffs, among others that of exemption from episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, and provisions were made for the pursuit of higher studies in many of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, one <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> regulation ordaining that no member could be raised to any dignity in the order without the degree of Doctor of Divinity, for which a rigid examination was prescribed.

<p>The congregation spread rapidly through <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, where alone it soon numbered 170 houses, and it attained an equal degree of prosperity in other countries, being divided into five flourishing provinces: <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (including Croatia), <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, Istria, and Sweden. In 1381 the body of St. Paul, patron of the order, was transferred from <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Laurence in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, which thereby gained greatly in prestige. Among the other famous houses of the congregation were the historical Polish <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Our Lady of Claremont (commonly called Czestochovia), with its <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> image of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> (according to legend the work of St. Luke and discovered by St. Helena with the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">True Cross</a>), and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at Presburg and Neustadt near <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. The church of San Stefano Rotondo at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was attached to the Hungarian College by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>. In 1783 a number of houses in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, <a href="../cathen/14318a.htm">Styria</a>, etc. were suppressed, and political disturbances in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> brought the same fate to most of the Hungarian <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, which had rendered incalculable services to religion and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The destruction of the annals of these houses left the historical sources very meagre. There are still a few houses of the congregation in Galicia and Russian <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and the church connected with the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Kracow may be regarded as a national sanctuary.

<p>Among the members of the congregation to attain prominence were <a href="../cathen/09735a.htm">George Martinuzzi</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07040a.htm">Grosswardein</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> (<a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> 16 Dec., 1551), an important figure in the history of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>; Matthias Fuhrmann of Hernals (d. 1773), historian of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and editor of the Acts of St. Paul of <a href="../cathen/14562b.htm">Thebes</a>; Fortunatus D&uuml;rich (1802), and Franz Faustin Prochaska (d. 1809), editors of a Czech translation of the Scriptures. The garb was originally brown, but about 1341 white was adopted, with a <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a>, and over the habit a <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> with a hood. In choir a white mantle is worn.
<h2 id="section2">Hermits of St. Paul of France</h2>

<p>Also called Brothers of Death. There is much discussion as to the origin of this congregation, but it was probably founded about 1620 by Guillaume Callier, whose constitutions for it were approved by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> (18 Dec., 1620) and later by Louis XIII (May, 1621). There were two classes of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, those in the cities, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to maintain at least twelve members, who visited the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, the sick, and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, attended those condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a>, and buried the dead; and the houses outside the city, with which were connected separate cells in which solitaries lived, the whole community assembling weekly for choir and monthly in chapter to confess their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Severe <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> and disciplines were prescribed. The name Brothers of Death originated from the fact that the thought of death was constantly before the religious. At their profession the <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers for the dead</a> were recited; their <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> bore the skull; their salutation was <em>Memento mori</em>; the death's head was set before them at table and in their cells. This congregation was suppressed by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> in 1633.
<h2 id="section3">Hermits of St. Paul of Portugal</h2>

<p>Among the conflicting accounts of the foundation of this congregation, the most credible seems to be that it was established about 1420 by Mendo Gomez, a nobleman of Simbria, who resigned dearly bought military laurels to retire to a solitude near Setuval, where he built an oratory and gave himself up to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and penance, gradually assuming the leadership of a number of other <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> in the vicinity. Later a community of <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> of Sierra de Ossa, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of whose foundation is also in dispute, being left without a superior, prevailed on Mendo Gomez to unite the two communities, under the patronage of St. Paul, first <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>. At the chapter held after the death of the founder (24 Jan., 1481), constitutions were drawn up, which at a later date were approved, with some alterations, by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> (1578), at the request of Cardinal Henry of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, who also obtained for the congregation the privilege of adopting the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>. This congregation was later suppressed. Probably the most celebrated member was Antonius a Matre Dei, author of "Apis Libani", a commentary on the Proverbs of Solomon.
<h2 id="section4">Blind Sisters of St. Paul</h2>

<p>Founded at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1852, by A. F. Villemain (d. 1870), Anne Bergunion (d. 1863), and the Abb&eacute; Jug&eacute;, to enable blind <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to lead a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, and to facilitate the training of blind children in useful occupations. A home was established for blind <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and girls with defective sight.
<h2 id="section5">Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres</h2>

<p>(Also called to <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a>). Known also as <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a>, founded in the latter part of the seventeenth century for teaching and the care of the poor and sick. After the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> the congregation was revived, was authorized by the Government in 1811, and soon numbered 1200 sisters and over 100 houses in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/07044a.htm">Guadeloupe</a>, <a href="../cathen/09731a.htm">Martinique</a>, French Guiana, Corea, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a>, Further <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, etc. In <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> has been established for native subjects, and in Hong-Kong a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> children, besides various benevolent institutions. In Further <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> there are thirty institutions, chiefly of a benevolent nature, in addition to a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, which has already admitted a number of native <a href="../cathen/12319b.htm">postulants</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> are <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>.
