<h1>Paulus Bril</h1>  

<p>A brilliant <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> and engraver, born at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, 1556; died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 7 October, 1626. He first studied with Damiaen Oertelmans, a member of the guild of St. Luke in his native city. Fired by the news of the success of his brother Matthys, in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he left his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> secretly and started for that city. He was detained at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> by lack of funds, and worked there in order to be able to continue his journey. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he studied with his brother, but found his best inspiration later in the copies he made of the landscapes of <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a>. With these as a basis he developed a vigorous and individual style of his own, the manifestations of which are said to have led greatly to the development of landscape art by their influence on <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a>, <a href="../cathen/03374c.htm">Annibale Carracci</a>, and Claude Lorraine. He assisted his brother in his works at the Vatican, and on the death of the latter (b. about 1548, d. 1584) he continued his labours <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Pope Gregory XIII</a> gave him his work which they had jointly undertaken.

<p>Bril's principal production in the Vatican is a landscape in fresco sixty-eight feet long, ordered by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Pope Clement VIII</a> for the Sala Clementina, in which appears St. Clement, with an anchor fastened to his neck, being cast into the sea. Bril worked in the Sistine Chapel, in Santa Maria Maggiore, and in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13505a.htm">Scala Santa</a> in St. John Lateran. He introduced figures in the landscapes with much success, but in some of them appear compositions of <a href="../cathen/03374c.htm">Annibale Carracci</a>. His "Duck Hunt", "Diana and Nymphs", "Fisher-men", "Pan and Syrinx", "St. Jerome in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a>" and three other landscapes are in the Louvre. His "Prodigal Son" is in the Antwerp Museum, and his "St. Paul in the Desert", "Boar Hunt" and "Triumph of Psyche" in the Uffizi at Florence. His works appear in number in all the principal <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> galleries.
