<h1>Paulus Orosius</h1>  

<p>Historian and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a>; b. probably at Bracara, now Braga, in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, between 380 and 390, the dates of his birth and death not being precisely known. His first name has been known only since the eighth century. Having early <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> himself to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, and went to Africa in 413 or 414. The reason for his leaving his native country is not known; he tells us only that he left his fatherland "sine voluntate, sine necessitate, sine consensu" (Commonitorium, i). He repaired to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, at <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, to question him as to certain points of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, concerning the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and its origin, attacked by the Priscillianists. In 414 he prepared for St. Augustine a "Commonitorium de errore Priscillianistarum et Origenistarum" (P.L. XXXI, 1211-16; also, ed. Schepss, in "Priscilliani quae supersunt", in "Corpus script. eccl. lat.", <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 1889, XVIII, 149 sqq.) to which St. Augustine replied with his "Ad Orosium contra Priscillianistas et Origenistas". In order to become better acquainted with these questions concerning the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and its origin, Orosius, with a hearty recommendation from .htm-->St. Augustine (Epist. clxvi), went to Palestine, to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> was then trying to spread his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrines</a> in Palestine, and Orosius aided <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> and others in their struggle against this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. In 415 Bishop John of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, who was inclined to the teaching of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> and influenced by <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>, summoned the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> of his church to a council at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. At this council Orosius sharply attacked the teachings of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>. But, as <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> declared that he believed it impossible for man to become perfect and avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> assistance, John did not condemn him, but decided that his opponents should state their arguments before <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Pope Innocent</a>. In consequence of his opposition to <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>, Orosius was drawn into dissensions with Bishop John, who accused him of having maintained that it is not possible for man to avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">God's grace</a>. In answer to this charge, Orosius wrote his "Liber apologeticus contra Pelagium de Arbitrii libertate" (P.L. XXXI, 1173-1212, and ed. Zangemeister, "Orosii opera" in "Corpus script. eccl. lat.", V, Vienna, 1882), in which he gives a detailed account of the Council of 415 at <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and a clear, correct treatment of the two principal questions against <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>: the capability of man's <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">Christian perfection</a> in doing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will here on earth.

<p>In the spring of 416 Orosius left Palestine, to return to Augustine in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, and thence home. He brought a letter from <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (Epist. cxxxiv) to <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, as well as writings of the two Gallic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Hero and Lazarus, who were in Palestine struggling against <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> (cf. St. Augustine, Epist. clxxv). He also brought from <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> the then recently discovered <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the Protomartyr Stephen and a Latin letter from Lucian, who had discovered them (Gennadius, "De Viris Illustr.", xxxi, xlvi, xlvii, ed. Czapla, M&uuml;nster, 1898, 87-89, 104). After a short stay with Augustine at <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, Orosius began his journey home, but, on reaching Minorca, and hearing of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and devastations of the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, he returned to <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Stephen, which he left in <a href="../cathen/10332a.htm">Minorca</a>, became the object of a great veneration, which spread into Gaul and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. On the conversion of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> through these <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, cf. Severus, "De virtutibus ad conversionem Judaeorum in Minoricensi Insula factis", P.L. XLI, 821-32. Orosius went back to Africa and at St. Augustine's suggestion wrote the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Universal History: "Historiarum adversus paganos libri septem" (P.L. XXXI, 663-1174; ed. Zangemeister, in "Corpus script. eccl. lat.", V, Vienna, 1882), thought to be a supplement to the "Civitas Dei", especially the third book, in which St. Augustine proves that the Roman Empire suffered as many calamities before as after <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was received, combating the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> argument, that the abandonment of their <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> had led to calamity. .htm-->St. Augustine wished to have this <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> developed in a special work through the whole period of human history of all the known peoples of antiquity, with the fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> determines the destinies of nations. According to his view, two chief empires had governed the world: Babylon in the East, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the West. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> received the heritage of Babylon through the intermediate Macedonian and Carthaginian Empires. Thus he holds that there were four great empires in history &mdash; a view widely accepted in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The first book briefly describes the globe, and traces its history from the <a href="../cathen/04702a.htm">Deluge</a> to the founding of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; the second gives the history of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to the sack of the city by the Gauls, that of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> to Cyrus, and of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> to the Battle of Cunaxa; the third deals chiefly with the Macedonian Empire under Alexander and his successors, as well as the contemporary Roman history; the fourth brings the history of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to the destruction of Carthage; the last three books treat Roman history alone, from the destruction of Carthage to the author's own time. The work, completed in 418, shows signs of some haste. Besides <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05616a.htm">chronicle of Eusebius</a> revised by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, Livy, Eutropius, Caesar, Suetonius, Florus, and <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> are used as sources. In pursuance of the apologetic aim, all the calamities suffered by the various peoples are described. Thought superficial and fragmentary, the work is valuable; it contains contemporary information on the period after A.D. 378. It was used largely during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> as a compendium, and nearly 200 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> copies are still extant. <a href="../cathen/01309d.htm">Alfred the Great</a> translated it into Anglo-Saxon (ed. H. Sweet, London, 1843).
