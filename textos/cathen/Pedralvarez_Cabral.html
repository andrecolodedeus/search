<h1>Pedralvarez Cabral</h1>  

<p>(Pedro Alvarez.)

<p>A celebrated Portuguese navigator, generally called the discoverer of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, born probably around 1460; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of death uncertain. Very little is known concerning the life of Cabral. He was the third son of Fernao Cabral, Governor of Beira and Belmonte, and Isabel de Gouvea, and married Isabel de Castro, the daughter of the distinguished Fernando de Noronha. He must have had an excellent training in navigation and large experience as a seaman, for King Emmanuel of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> considered him competent to continue the work of <a href="../cathen/06374a.htm">Vasco da Gama</a>, and in the year 1500 placed him in command of a fleet which was to set sail for <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. His commission was to establish permanent commercial relations and to introduce <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> wherever he went, using force of arms when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to gain his point. The nature of the undertaking led rich Florentine merchants to contribute to the equipment of the ships, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to join the expedition. Among the captains of the fleet, which consisted of thirteen ships with 1,200 men, were Bartolomeu Diaz, Pero Vaz de Caminha, and Nicolao Coelho, the latter the companion of <a href="../cathen/06374a.htm">da Gama</a>. <a href="../cathen/06374a.htm">Da Gama</a> himself gave the directions <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the course of the voyage.

<p>The fleet left <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, 9 March, 1500, and following the course laid down, sought to avoid the calms of the coast of Guinea. On leaving the Cape Verde Islands, where Luis Pirez was forced by a storm to return to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, they sailed in a decidedly southwesterly direction. On 22 April a mountain was visible, to which the name of "Mt. Paschoal" was given; on the 23rd Coelho landed on the coast of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, and on the 25th the entire fleet sailed into the harbor called "Porto Seguro". Cabral perceived that the new country lay east of the line of demarcation made by <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>, and at once sent Andreas Gon&ccedil;alvez (according to other authorities Gaspar de Lemos) to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> with the important tidings. Believing the island to be an island he gave it the name of "Island of Vera Cruz" and took possession of it by erecting a cross and holding a religious service. The service was celebrated by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, Father Henrique, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ceuta, on the island called Coroa Vermelha in the bay of Cabralia. Cabral resumed his voyage 3 May; by the end of the month the fleet approached the Cape of Good Hope, where it was struck by a storm in which four vessels, including that of Bartolomeu Diaz, were lost. With the ships now reduced to one-half of the original number, Cabral reached Sofala, 16 July, and Mozambique, 20 July; in the latter place he received a cordial greeting. On 26 July he came to Kilwa where he was unable to make an agreement with the ruler; on 2 August he reached Melinde; here he had a friendly welcome and obtained a pilot to take him to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. At Calicut, where he arrived 13 September, he met with many obstacles, so that he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to bombard the town for two days; in <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a> and Kananur, however, he succeeded in making advantageous treaties. Cabral started on the return voyage, 16 January, 1501, and arrived at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, 31 July, or, as is sometimes given, 23 June. On the way home he met Pero Diaz whom he had dispatched, during his voyage, to Magadoxo, and in September the last of his ships, in command of Sancho de Toar whom he had sent to Sofala, returned to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>. Of his later life nothing is known.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The authorities for the voyage of discovery of Cabral are contained in the reports of eyewitnesses, especially in the letter of VAZ DE CAMINHA to King Emmanuel, of which the original was discovered in 1790. This letter was first published by CAZAL in his Corograf&iacute;a brazilica (1817), I, 12-34; the best edition is in the Revista do Instituto Historico Geographico do Brasil (Rio de Janeiro, 1877), XL, Pt. II, 12-37. Another narrative is that of a pilot, published by RAMUSIO in his Delle Navig. e Viaggi (Venice, 1563), I, 1221-127. There is also a description of the voyage in BARROS, Asia (Lisbon, 1552), Dec. I, lib. V, i-x; in FARIO Y SOUSA, Asia Port., I, 1, v, 45-49, and in the writings of other historians. VARNHAGEN, Historia geral do Brazil (Rio de Janeiro, 1854), I; Materials for a Biography in Revista do Instituto Histor.
