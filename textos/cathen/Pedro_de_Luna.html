<h1>Pedro de Luna</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">Antipope</a> under the name of Benedict XIII, b. at Illueca, <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, 1328; d. at the Pe&ntilde;iscola, near <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, either 29 Nov., 1422, or 23 May, 1423. He was elected 28 Sept., 1394, deposed at the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> 26 July, 1417. Pedro Martini belonged to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of de Luna; he studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a>, where he obtained his doctor's degree, and later taught canon law at that <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. On 30 Dec., 1375, <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> made him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal deacon</a> of S. Maria in Cosmedin. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was attracted to him by his noble lineage, his austere life, and great learning, as well as by his untiring energy and great <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Cardinal Pedro de Luna returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a>, after whose death in 1378 he took part in the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> which was attacked by the Romans, and which elected <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>, for whom he voted. He showed great <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> at the unexpected attack upon the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, and would not take flight, declaring "Even if I must die, I will fall here". He was among the first <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to return to the Vatican on 9 April, in order to continue the election of <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>. At first he distinctly and decidedly took sides for this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (Valois, "La France et le grand schisme d'occident", I, 72-74). About 24 June, 1378, he joined the other non-Italian <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> at <a href="../cathen/01448a.htm">Anagni</a>, where he became convinced of the invalidity of the vote for <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>. He took part in the election of <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Robert of Geneva (Clement VII)</a> at Fondi on 20 Sept., 1378, and became a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> adherent of this <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> whose legality he energetically defended, and to whom he rendered great service.

<p><a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a> sent him as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> for the Kingdoms of Castile, <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, in order to win them over to the obedience of the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Owing to his powerful relations, his influence in the Province of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> was very great. In 1393 <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Brabant, <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. As such he stayed principally in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, but he did not confine his activities to those countries that belonged to the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> obedience. He did not then oppose the union; on the contrary, he familiarized himself with the endeavours of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, which strove to suppress the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, in consequence of which, on his return to the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, a coolness arose between <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a> and himself. When the latter died, 16 Sept., 1394, Pedro de Luna was unanimously chosen, 28 Sept., to succeed him. His desire to put an end to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, even if he had to renounce the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> dignity (<em>via cessionis</em>) was a strong inducement for the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> obedience to unite their votes in his favour. After his election he solemnly renewed his promises given during the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, to work for the re-establishment of unity, and if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to renounce the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> in order to put an end to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. As he was only a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, he was made a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 3 Oct., and on 11 Oct. was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He took the name of Benedict XIII.

<p>The choice of Cardinal de Luna was welcomed by the French court, and by the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>; they hoped that the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who was much esteemed because of his austere life and personal ability, would by his own efforts restore Church unity. Nevertheless Benedict XIII sought to preserve entire freedom of action in his relations with the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. The assembly of the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> which took place 3 Feb., 1395, and lasted until 18 Feb., in order to confer on a means of putting an end to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, agreed that the only way was for both <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> to abdicate (<em>via cessiones</em>), and the French court believed it could arbitrarily put this expedient in practice. A brilliant embassy, headed by three of the most powerful French princes, brought this resolution to Benedict XIII, and sought to gain his consent. But the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> obstinately opposed it, in spite of the fact that the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> sided with the embassy. He insisted that personal negotiations between both <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> was the best course to pursue (<em>via discussionis</em>), and tenaciously clung to his opinion. Upon which the French court and the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> sought to win over the secular princes to the support of the <em>via cessionis.</em> But the different embassies of the year 1396 met with little success. Meanwhile Benedict XIII sought to enter into an alliance with the Roman <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>. Ambassadors were sent from <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and vice versa; but <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> refused to entertain the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of resigning, being as firmly convinced as Benedict that he was the legitimate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had possessions in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, which he held on to with all his power; seeking not only to prejudice the kings and princes of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> who belonged to his obedience against the action of the French court, but to win them over to his own cause; he also tried to win back the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Another assembly of the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> met 16 Aug., 1396. They again decided in favour of the abdication of both <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>; this time the ambassadors of the French court met with greater success at the foreign courts. However, neither the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> nor the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> would consent to this way, so that the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> remained as heretofore, while general discontent reigned in all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> countries. An embassy undertaken by Pierre d'Ailly, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>, to Benedict, by order of Charles VI of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and Wenceslaus of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, accomplished nothing. In May, 1398, a third assembly of the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> took place, and they resolved to withdraw from the obedience of Benedict. This resolution was published 27 July, 1398, and immediately took effect. On 1 Sept., two royal commissioners publicly announced the withdrawal of the obedience at Villeneuve, near <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, inviting all the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to leave Benedict's curia, under penalty of the forfeiture of their <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Also those who were not French lost their <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> if they still remained with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> On 2 Sept., seventeen <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> left <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and took up their abode at Villeneuve, on French territory. They sent an envoy to Benedict, summoning him to agree to the <em>via cessionis.</em> But he declared that he would rather suffer death. Then eighteen <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> left him and withdrew their obedience; only five <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> remained faithful to him.



<p>Geoffroy Boucicout occupied <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> with troops, and besieged the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in his palace, but failed to take the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> fortress by storm. Benedict was at last <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to treat with his enemies; in an understanding with his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> he pledged himself to renounce the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> if the Roman <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> would do likewise. Nevertheless on 9 May, 1399, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had a notary, in the presence of two witnesses, draw up a protest opposing these stipulations as obtained from him by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>, which proceedings he repeated later on. The negotiations as to the custodians of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in his palace at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> were long drawn out, owing to Benedict's clever policy; at last Louis of Orl&eacute;ans was chosen. Meanwhile a change took place in the public opinion in favour of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> who was considered to be ill-used. Advances were made between the latter and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and many <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, among them <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a> and <a href="../cathen/04011b.htm">Nicholas de Cl&eacute;manges</a>, began to attack as unlawful the aforesaid withdrawal of the French obedience. The negotiations which <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had carried on with the different princes in order to end the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> met with no success. On 12 March, 1403, Benedict secretly took flight from <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and reached territory belonging to Louis II of Anjou, where he was safe. <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> immediately submitted again to him, and his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> likewise recognized him, so that in a short time his obedience was re-established in the whole of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>Benedict XIII now renewed the interrupted negotiations with the Roman <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and in 1404 sent four envoys to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to suggest to <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> that some safe spot should be chosen for a meeting between the two <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and both <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">colleges of cardinals</a>, and thus by mutual agreement put an end to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. To this proposition <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface</a> would not listen. After the latter's death (1 Oct., 1404) Benedict's envoys continued to parley with the Roman <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. These however on 17 Oct., elected <a href="../cathen/08019a.htm">Innocent VII</a>, who also declined any further negotiations. Meanwhile Benedict XIII was trying to strengthen his position through extension of his obedience. In May, 1405, he went to <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, in order to enter into new negotiations with <a href="../cathen/08019a.htm">Innocent VII</a>, but again without results. Benedict understood how to gain new adherents, and now hoped with their aid to drive his adversary from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and thus keep the field as the only <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. However, his position in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> again became critical. While his attitude in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> caused great dissatisfaction, partly because of his taxation of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, and partly because of his indifference to the restoration of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> unity; also because of his departure from <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. He returned to <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> by way of <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Nice</a>, and declared himself ready to assemble a council of the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> obedience. Another assembly of the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> took place at the end of 1406; they wished to revoke the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> right to tax the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. Though Benedict was severely censured, he also found <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> partisans. But no palpable results were obtained.

<p>When <a href="../cathen/08019a.htm">Innocent VII</a> died, 6 Nov., 1406, it was hoped, in case a new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was not chosen at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, that Benedict would at last fulfil his promise of abdication, so as to open the way for a new and unanimous election; but as he gave only evasive answers to such suggestions, <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a> was chosen <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> 30 Nov., at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The latter wrote immediately to Benedict, and announced that he was ready to abdicate on condition that Benedict would do likewise, and that afterwards the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> would unite with those of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for a unanimous papal election. Benedict replied 31 Jan., 1407, accepting the proposition. Further endeavours were now made, in order to induce both <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> to secede, and for this purpose a meeting was planned at <a href="../cathen/13489c.htm">Savona</a> between Benedict and <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory</a>. But it never took place. Benedict, indeed, arrived at <a href="../cathen/13489c.htm">Savona</a>, 24 Sept., but <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory</a> did not appear. The position of the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> grew worse; on 23 Nov., 1407, his principal protector in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Louis of Orl&eacute;ans, the king's brother, was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> no longer received any revenues from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, and when he wrote a threatening letter to King Charles VI, the latter tore it up. On 25 May, 1408, the king declared that <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was neutral towards both <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> pretenders. Soon a number of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> belonging to both obediences met for the purpose of convening a universal council (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">COUNCIL OF PISA</a>). Benedict XIII fled to Roussillon, and on his side called a council at Perpignan which opened on 21 Nov., 1408. Both <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> were deposed at the <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a>. The delegation that Benedict sent thither arrived too late. In spite of this, the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was still recognized by <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a>, and the Island of Sicily.

<p>The territory of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> was seized in 1411 for the Pisan <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (<a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Alexander V</a>). Since 1408 Benedict had resided at Perpignan. Emperor Sigismund went there, 19 Sept., 1415, from the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>, in order to urge the abdication of Benedict, but without avail. Later it was decided to hold a conference at Narbonne in Dec., 1415, between the representatives of those countries who until then had acknowledged Benedict, for the purpose of withdrawing their obedience on account of his obstinacy. Thereupon, Benedict retired to the castle of Pe&ntilde;iscola (near Valencia, in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>) which belonged to his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. An embassy to him from the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> failed to soften his stubbornness, and he was deposed by the council 27 July, 1417. He never submitted to the decision of the council, but continued to consider himself the only legitimate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and compared Pe&ntilde;iscola to <a href="../cathen/01720a.htm">Noah's Ark</a>. Four <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who remained with him, later acknowledged <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> as rightful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Benedict maintained that in 1418 one of the latter's ambassadors had tried to poison him. The date of Pedro de Luna's death has never been ascertained. It is difficult to decide between 29 Nov., 1422, and 23 May, 1423; the date generally given [1424] is incorrect. His few adherents gave him a successor, Mu&ntilde;oz, who for a time continued the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. Pedro de Luna wrote one or two treatises on canon law ("De concilio generali"; "De novo schismate") edited only in part (Ehrle in "Archiv f&uuml;r Literatur- und Kirchengeschichte des Mittelalters", VII, 515 sqq.).
