<h1>Pelagia</h1>  

<p>The name of several <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. The old Syrian <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> gives the feast of a St. Pelagia of Antioch (in Antiochia Pelagi&aelig;) under the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of 8 October. Further information concerning this <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, undoubtedly an historical <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, is given in a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> [P.G., L, 479 sqq.; Ruinart, &quot;Acta mart. sincera&quot; (ed. <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>), 540 sqq.]. Pelagia was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> virgin fifteen years of age. Soldiers came in search of her, evidently during the <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, in order to force her to offer publicly a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> sacrifice. She was alone in the house, no one being there to aid her. She came out to the soldiers sent after her and when she learned the order they had to execute, she requested permission to go again into the house in order to put on other clothing. This was granted to her. The virgin who probably <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what was before her was not willing to expose herself to the danger of being dishonoured. She therefore went up to the roof of the house and threw herself into the sea. Thus she died, as St. Chrysostom says, as virgin and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as such by the Antiochene Church. <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> also mentions this Pelagia of Antioch (&quot;De virginibus&quot;, III, vii; Epist. XXVII, &quot;Ad Simplicianum&quot;, xxxviii).

<p>There is a later legend of a Pelagia who is said to have led the life of a prostitute at Antioch and to have been converted by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> named Nonnus. According to the story she went to Jerusalem where disguised as a man and under the name of Pelagius she led a life of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">self-mortification</a> in a grotto on the Mount of Olives. The author of this legend who calls himself the Deacon Jacob has drawn the essential part of his narrative from the forty-eighth <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> on the Gospel of St. Matthew. In this <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> the preacher relates the conversion of a celebrated actress of Antioch whose name he does not give. As no old authority makes any mention of a Pelagia in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the alleged converted <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is a purely legendary recasting of the historical Pelagia. In the East the feast of this second Pelagia is observed on the same day (8 October); in the present Roman <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> the feast of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> is observed on 9 June, that of the penitent on 8 October.

<p>On the latter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> also celebrates as virgin and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> still another Pelagia of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>. The Roman <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> places the feast of this Pelagia on 4 May. There is a legend of later date concerning her. As Tarsus was near Antioch St. Pelagia of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> should probably be identified with the Antiochene <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, whose feast was also observed in <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> and who was afterwards turned into a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>. Usener's opinion that all these different <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are only a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> reconstitution of Aphrodite has been completely disproved by Delehaye.

<p>In addition to St. Pelagia of Antioch, taken from the Syrian <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a>, the &quot;Martyrologium Hieronymianum&quot; also mentions on 11 July a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Pelagia, the companion in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of a Januarius, naming Nicopolis in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> as the place of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and giving a brief account of this saint. She is plainly a different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> from the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of Antioch. Her name was included by <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a> in his <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> and was adopted from this into the present Roman list of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.
