<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pelagius II</h1>  

<p>The date of whose birth is unknown, seemingly a native of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but of Gothic descent, as his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> name was Winigild, died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 7 Feb., 590. He succeeded <a href="../cathen/02427c.htm">Benedict I</a>, when the Lombards were besieging <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> was delayed in the hope of securing the confirmation of the election by the emperor. But the blockade of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the Lombards, and their control of the great thoroughfares was effective and, after four months, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> (26 Nov., 579). The most important acts of Pelagius have relation to the Lombards, or to the Istrian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a>. Moved, it would seem, by the words of the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and probably still more by his money and that of the emperor, the Lombards at length drew off from the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Thereupon, Pelagius at once sent an embassy (in which the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> was apparently included) to Constantinople to explain the circumstances of his election, and to ask that succour should be sent to save <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> from the barbarians. But not very much in the way of help for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was forthcoming at this period from the exhausted Eastern Roman Empire. Emperor Maurice, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, sent somewhat later (c. 584) a new official to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> with the title of <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a>, and with combined civil and military authority over the whole peninsula. But, when he came to <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, this new functionary brought with him only an insufficient military force, and meanwhile both emperor and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had turned to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>.

<p>Towards the beginning of his pontificate (Oct., 580 or 581) Pelagius wrote to Aunacharius (or Aunarius), <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Auxerre, a man of great influence with the different <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kings, and begged him to give a practical <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he had professed for the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, by urging them to come to the assistance of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. "We believe", he wrote, "that it has been brought about by a special <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Princes should profess the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; like the Roman Emperors, in order that they may help this city, whence it took its rise. . . . Persuade them with all earnestness to keep from any friendship and alliance with our most unspeakable enemies, the Lombards." At length either the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of Pelagius, or the political arts of the emperor, induced the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> to attack the Lombards in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. But their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> or imperial cause was soon exhausted, and they allowed themselves to be bribed to retire from the peninsula. The distress of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> deepened. Pelagius had already sent to Constantinople the ablest of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Gregory, afterwards <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory I, the Great</a>. As the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> apocrisiary, or <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> had been commissioned to haunt the imperial palace day and night, never to be absent from it for an hour, and to strain every nerve to induce the emperor to send help to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. To him Pelagius now dispatched letter after letter urging him to increased exertion. He also implored the new Exarch of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a> (584), to succour <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but was told that he was unable to protect the exarchate, still less <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>Failing to get help from <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> he sent a fresh embassy to Constantinople and exhorted <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> to act along with it in endeavouring to obtain the desired help. "Here", he wrote, "we are in such straits that unless <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> move the heart of the emperor to have pity on us, and send us a Master of the soldiery (<em>magister militum</em>) and a duke, we shall be entirely at the mercy of our enemies, as most of the district round <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is without protection; and the army of these most unspeakable people will take possession of the places still held for the empire." Though no imperial troops came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> succeeded in concluding a truce with the Lombards. Taking advantage of this "peace and quiet", Pelagius II renewed the exertions of his <a href="../cathen/11602a.htm">namesake</a> to put an end to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> caused in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> by the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> by Vigilius. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> was recalled from Constantinople, and assisted the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the correspondence which was forthwith initiated with Bishop Elias of Grado and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Istria. In one letter after another the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> bade them remember that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Peter could not be crushed nor changed, and that that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he held was the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, as well as of the first three <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a>; and, in the most touching terms, he exhorted them to hold to that glorious <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> unity which they were breaking "for the sake of superfluous questions and of defending <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> chapters". The words of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> were, however, lost upon the schismatics, and equally without effect was the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the Exarch Smaragdus, who seized Severus, the successor of Elias, and, by threats, compelled him to enter into communion with the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, John of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> (588). But as soon as Severus returned to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, he repudiated what he had done, and the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> continued for some two hundred years longer.

<p>Pelagius was one of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> who laboured to promote the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy of the clergy</a>, and he issued such stringent regulations on this matter, with regard to the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> in the island of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, that his successor <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory I</a> thought them too strict, and modified them to some extent. But if <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> had to check the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Pelagius in one direction he emulated it in another. The protest of Pelagius against the assumption of the title "&oelig;cumenical" by the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople was repeated with added emphasis by his former secretary. Among the works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> recorded of Pelagius may be noted his adorning of the Shrine of St. Peter, turning his own house into a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and rebuilding the Church of St. Lawrence, where may still be seen a <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> (probably executed by Pelagius) depicting <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> as standing on the right side of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>. Pelagius fell a victim to the terrible plague that devastated <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the end of 589 and was buried in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>.
