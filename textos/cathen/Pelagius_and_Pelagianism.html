<h1>Pelagius and Pelagianism</h1>  

<p>Pelagianism received its name from Pelagius and designates a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the fifth century, which denied <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Christian grace</a>.
<h2>Life and writings of Pelagius</h2>

<p>Apart from the chief episodes of the Pelagian controversy, little or nothing is known about the personal career of Pelagius. It is only after he bade a lasting farewell to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in A.D. 411 that the sources become more abundant; but from 418 on history is again silent about his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. As <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (De peccat. orig., xxiv) testifies that he lived in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> "for a very long time", we may presume that he resided there at least since the reign of Pope Anastasius (398-401). But about his long life prior to the year 400 and above all about his youth, we are left wholly in the dark. Even the country of his birth is disputed. While the most trustworthy witnesses, such as Augustine, Orosius, Prosper, and Marius Mercator, are quite explicit in assigning Britain as his native country, as is apparent from his cognomen of Brito or Britannicus, Jerome (Praef. in Jerem., lib. I and III) ridicules him as a "Scot" (loc. cit., "habet enim progeniem Scoticae gentis de Britannorum vicinia"), who being "stuffed with Scottish porridge" (<em>Scotorum pultibus proegravatus</em>) suffers from a weak memory. Rightly arguing that the "Scots" of those days were really the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, H. Zimmer ("Pelagius in Ireland", p. 20, Berlin, 1901) has advanced weighty reasons for the hypothesis that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> home of Pelagius must be sought in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and that he journeyed through the southwest of Britain to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Tall in stature and portly in appearance (Jerome, loc. cit., "grandis et corpulentus"), Pelagius was highly <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, spoke and wrote Latin as well as Greek with great fluency and was well versed in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Though a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and consequently devoted to practical asceticism, he never was a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>; for both Orosius and <a href="../cathen/15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a> simply call him a "layman". In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself he enjoyed the reputation of austerity, while St. Augustine called him even a "saintly man", <em>vir sanctus</em>: with <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">St. Paulinus of Nola</a> (405) and other prominent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, he kept up an edifying correspondence, which he used later for his personal defence.

<p>During his sojourn in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he composed several works: "De fide Trinitatis libri III", now lost, but extolled by <a href="../cathen/06417a.htm">Gennadius</a> as "indispensable reading matter for students"; "Eclogarum ex divinis Scripturis liber unus", in the main collection of Bible passages based on <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian's</a> "Testimoniorum libri III", of which St. Augustine has preserved a number of fragments; "Commentarii in epistolas S. Pauli", elaborated no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> before the destruction of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Alaric (410) and known to St. Augustine in 412. Zimmer (loc. cit.) deserves credit for having rediscovered in this commentary on <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> the original work of Pelagius, which had, in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, been attributed to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (P.L., XXX, 645-902). A closer examination of this work, so suddenly become famous, brought to light the fact that it contained the fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> afterwards condemned as "Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>". In it Pelagius denied the primitive state in <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a> and <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> (cf. P.L., XXX, 678, "Insaniunt, qui de Adam per traducem asserunt ad nos venire peccatum"), insisted on the naturalness of <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> and the death of the body, and ascribed the actual existence and universality of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to the bad example which Adam set by his first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. As all his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> were chiefly rooted in the old, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> philosophy, especially in the popular system of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, rather than in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, he regarded the moral strength of man's will (<em>liberum arbitrium</em>), when steeled by asceticism, as sufficient in itself to desire and to attain the loftiest ideal of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The value of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">Christ's redemption</a> was, in his opinion, limited mainly to instruction (<em>doctrina</em>) and example (<em>exemplum</em>), which the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> threw into the balance as a counterweight against Adam's wicked example, so that nature retains the ability to conquer <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and to gain eternal life even without the aid of grace. By justification we are indeed cleansed of our personal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone (loc. cit., 663, "per solam fidem justificat Deus impium convertendum"), but this pardon (<em>gratia remissionis</em>) implies no interior renovation of sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. How far the <em>sola-fides</em> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> "had no stouter champion before <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> than Pelagius" and whether, in particular, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> conception of fiducial <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> dawned upon him many centuries before <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, as Loofs ("Realencyklop&#228;dies fur protest. Theologie", XV, 753, Leipzig, 1904) assumes, probably needs more careful investigation. For the rest, Pelagius would have announced nothing new by this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/01564b.htm">Antinomists</a> of the early Apostolic Church were already familiar with "justification by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone" (cf. <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">JUSTIFICATION</a>); on the other hand, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> boast of having been the first to proclaim the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of abiding <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, might well arouse opposition. However, Pelagius insists expressly (loc. cit. 812), "Ceterum sine operibus fidei, non legis, mortua est fides". But the commentary on St. Paul is silent on one chief point of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, i.e. the significance of infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which supposed that the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were even then clearly conscious of the existence of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> in children.



<p>To explain psychologically Pelagius's whole line of thought, it does not suffice to go back to the ideal of the wise man, which he fashioned after the <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> principles of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> and upon which his vision was centred. We must also take into account that his intimacy with the Greeks developed in him, though unknown to himself, a one-sidedness, which at first sight appears pardonable. The gravest <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> into which he and the rest of the Pelagians fell, was that they did not submit to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> decisions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. While the Latins had emphasized the guilt rather than its punishment, as the chief characteristic of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, the Greeks on the other hand (even <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a>) laid greater stress on the punishment than on the guilt. <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> went even so far as to deny the possibility of original guilt and consequently the penal character of the death of the body. Besides, at that time, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Christian grace</a> was everywhere vague and undefined; even the West was convinced of nothing more than that some sort of assistance was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and was given gratuitously, while the nature of this assistance was but little understood. In the East, moreover, as an offset to widespread fatalism, the moral power and freedom of the will were at times very strongly or even too strongly insisted on <em>assisting</em> grace being spoken of more frequently than <em>preventing</em> grace (see <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">GRACE</a>). It was due to the intervention of St. Augustine and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that greater clearness was gradually reached in the disputed questions and that the first impulse was given towards a more careful development of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> and grace.
<h2>Pelagius and Caelestius (411-415)</h2>

<p>Of far-reaching influence upon the further progress of Pelagianism was the friendship which Pelagius contracted in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with Caelestius, a lawyer of noble (probably Italian) descent. A eunuch by birth, but endowed with no mean talents, Caelestius had been won over to asceticism by his enthusiasm for the monastic life, and in the capacity of a <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay-monk</a> he endeavoured to convert the practical maxims learnt from Pelagius, into theoretical principles, which successfully propagated in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, while charging Pelagius with mysteriousness, mendacity, and shrewdness, calls Caelestius (De peccat. orig., xv) not only "incredibly loquacious", but also open-hearted, obstinate, and free in social intercourse. Even if their secret or open intrigues did not escape notice, still the two friends were not molested by the official Roman circles. But matters changed when in 411 they left the hospitable soil of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a>, which had been sacked by Alaric (410), and set sail for North Africa. When they landed on the coast near <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, Augustine, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city, was absent, being fully occupied in settling the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> disputes in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. Later, he met Pelagius in Carthage several times, without, however, coming into closer contact with him. After a brief sojourn in North Africa, Pelagius travelled on to Palestine, while Caelestius tried to have himself made a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> in <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>. But this plan was frustrated by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Paulinus of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, who submitted to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Aurelius, a memorial in which six theses of Caelestius &#151; perhaps literal extracts from his lost work "Contra traducem peccati" &#151; were branded as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. These theses ran as follows:

<ol> <li>Even if Adam had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, he would have died. <li>Adam's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> harmed only himself, not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. <li>Children just born are in the same state as Adam before his fall. <li>The whole <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">human race</a> neither dies through <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">Adam's sin</a> or death, nor rises again through the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection of Christ</a>. <li>The (<a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a>) is as good a guide to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> as the Gospel. <li>Even before the advent of Christ there were men who were without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. </ol>

<p>On account of these doctrines, which clearly contain the quintessence of Pelagianism, Caelestius was summoned to appear before a synod at Carthage (411); but he refused to retract them, alleging that the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">Adam's sin</a> was an open question and hence its denial was no <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. As a result he was not only excluded from <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, but his six theses were condemned. He declared his intention of appealing to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but without executing his design went to Ephesus in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.

<p>Meanwhile the Pelagian <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> had infected a wide area, especially around Carthage, so that Augustine and other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were compelled to take a resolute stand against them in sermons and private conversations. Urged by his friend Marcellinus, who "daily endured the most annoying debates with the erring brethren", <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> in 412 wrote the famous works: <a href="../fathers/1501.htm">"De peccatorum meritis et remissione libri III"</a> (P.L., XLIV, 109 sqq.) and "De spiritu et litera" (ibid., 201 sqq.), in which he positively established the existence of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, the necessity of infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the impossibility of a life without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the necessity of interior grace (<em>spiritus</em>) in opposition to the exterior grace of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> (<em>litera</em>). When in 414 disquieting rumours arrived from <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and the so-called "Definitiones Caelestii" (reconstructed in Garnier, "Marii Mercatoris Opera", I, 384 sqq., Paris, 1673), said to be the work of Caelestius, were sent to him, he at once (414 or 415) published the rejoinder, "De perfectione justitiae hominis" (P.L., XLIV, 291 sqq.), in which he again demolished the illusion of the possibility of complete freedom from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Out of charity and in order to win back the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erring</a> the more effectually, Augustine, in all these writings, never mentioned the two authors of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> by name.

<p>Meanwhile Pelagius, who was sojourning in Palestine, did not remain idle; to a noble Roman virgin, named Demetrias, who at Alaric's coming had fled to <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, he wrote a letter which is still extant (in P.L., XXX, 15-45) and in which he again inculcated his <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> principles of the unlimited energy of nature. Moreover, he published in 415 a work, now lost, "De natura", in which he attempted to prove his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> from authorities, appealing not only to the writings of Hilary and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, but also to the earlier works of Jerome and Augustine, both of whom were still alive. The latter answered at once (415) by his treatise <a href="../fathers/1503.htm">"De natura et gratia"</a> (P.L., XLIV, 247 sqq.). Jerome, however, to whom Augustine's pupil Orosius, a <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, personally explained the danger of the new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and who had been chagrined by the severity with which Pelagius had criticized his commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians, thought the time ripe to enter the lists; this he did by his letter to Ctesiphon (Ep. cxxliii) and by his graceful "Dialogus contra Pelagianos" (P.L., XXIII, 495 sqq.). He was assisted by Orosius, who, forthwith accused Pelagius in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Thereupon, Bishop John of Jerusalem "dearly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a>" (St. Augustine, "Ep. clxxix") Pelagius and had him at the time as his guest. He convoked in July, 415, a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> council for the investigation of the charge. The proceedings were hampered by the fact that Orosius, the accusing party, did not understand Greek and had engaged a poor interpreter, while the defendant Pelagius was quite able to defend himself in Greek and uphold his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. However, according to the personal account (written at the close of 415) of Orosius (Liber apolog. contra Pelagium, P.L., XXXI, 1173), the contesting parties at last agreed to leave the final judgment on all questions to the Latins, since both Pelagius and his adversaries were Latins, and to invoke the decision of <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a>; meanwhile silence was imposed on both parties.

<p>But Pelagius was granted only a short respite. For in the very same year, the Gallic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Heros of Arles and Lazarus of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, who, after the defeat of the usurper Constantine (411), had resigned their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and gone to Palestine, brought the matter before Bishop Eulogius of Caesarea, with the result that the latter summoned Pelagius in December, 415, before a synod of fourteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, held in Diospolis, the ancient Lydda. But fortune again favoured the heresiarch. About the proceedings and the issue we are exceptionally well informed through the account of St. Augustine, "De gestis Pelagii" (P.L., XLIV, 319 sqq.), written in 417 and based on the acts of the synod. Pelagius punctually obeyed the summons, but the principal complainants, Heros and Lazarus, failed to make their appearance, one of them being prevented by ill-health. And as Orosius, too, derided and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by Bishop John of Jerusalem, had departed, Pelagius met no personal plaintiff, while he found at the same time a skillful advocate in the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Anianus of Celeda (cf. Hieronym., "Ep. cxliii", ed. <a href="../cathen/15260a.htm">Vallarsi</a>, I, 1067). The principal points of the petition were translated by an interpreter into Greek and read only in an extract. Pelagius, having won the good-will of the assembly by reading to them some private letters of prominent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> among them one of Augustine (Ep. cxlvi) &#151; began to explain away and disprove the various accusations. Thus from the charge that he made the possibility of a sinless life solely dependent on <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, he exonerated himself by saying that, on the contrary, he required the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<em>adjutorium Dei</em>) for it, though by this he meant nothing else than the grace of creation (<em>gratia creationis</em>). Of other doctrines with which he had been charged, he said that, formulated as they were in the complaint, they did not originate from him, but from Caelestius, and that he also repudiated them. After the hearing there was nothing left for the synod but to discharge the defendant and to announce him as worthy of communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The Orient had now spoken twice and had found nothing to blame in Pelagius, because he had hidden his real sentiments from his judges.
<h2>Continuation and end of controversy (415-418)</h2>

<p>The new acquittal of Pelagius did not fail to cause excitement and alarm in North Africa, whither Orosius had hastened in 416 with letters from Bishops Heros and Lazarus. To parry the blow, something decisive had to be done. In autumn, 416, 67 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from Proconsular Africa assembled in a synod at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, which was presided over by Aurelius, while fifty-nine <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of Numidia, to which the See of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, St. Augustine's see belonged, held a synod in Mileve. In both places the doctrines of Pelagius and Caelestius were again rejected as contradictory to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. However, in order to secure for their decisions "the authority of the Apostolic See", both <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> wrote to <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a>, requesting his supreme sanction. And in order to impress upon him more strongly the seriousness of the situation, five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (Augustine, Aurelius, Alypius, Evodius, and Possidius) forwarded to him a joint letter, in which they detailed the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Christian grace</a> (.htm-->St. Augustine, "Epp. clxxv-vii"). In three separate epistles, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 27 Jan., 417, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> answered the synodal letters of Carthage and Mileve as well as that of the five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (Jaff&eacute;, "Regest.", 2nd ed., nn. 321-323, Leipzig, 1885). Starting from the principle that the resolutions of <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a> have no binding force until they are confirmed by the supreme authority of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> developed the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> on <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> and grace, and excluded Pelagius and Caelestius, who were reported to have rejected these doctrines, form communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> until they should come to their senses (<em>donec resipiscant</em>). In Africa, where the decision was received with unfeigned <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, the whole controversy was now regarded as closed, and Augustine, on 23 September, 417, announced from the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> (Serm., cxxxi, 10 in P.L., XXXVIII, 734), "Jam de hac causa duo concilia missa sunt ad Sedem apostolicam, inde etiam rescripta venerunt; causa finita est". (Two <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> having written to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> about this matter; the replies have come back; the question is settled.) But he was mistaken; the matter was not yet settled.

<p><a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> died on 12 March, 417, and Zosimus, a Greek by birth, succeeded him. Before his tribunal the whole Pelagian question was now opened once more and discussed in all its bearings. The occasion for this was the statements which both Pelagius and Caelestius submitted to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> in order to justify themselves. Though the previous decisions of <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> had removed all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> about the matter itself, yet the question of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> involved was undecided, viz. Did Pelagius and Caelestius really teach the theses condemned as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>? Zosimus' sense of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> forbade him to punish anyone with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> before he was duly convicted of his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. And if the steps recently taken by the two defendants were considered, the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> which might arise on this point were not wholly groundless. In 416 Pelagius had published a new work, now lost, "De libero arbitrio libri IV", which in its phraseology seemed to verge towards the Augustinian conception of grace and infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, even if in principle it did not abandon the author's earlier standpoint. Speaking of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Christian grace</a>, he admitted not only a <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>, but also a sort of interior grace, viz. an illumination of the mind (through sermons, reading of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, etc.), adding, however, that the latter served not to make salutary works possible, but only to facilitate their performance. As to infant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> he granted that it ought to be administered in the same form as in the case of adults, not in order to cleanse the children from a real original guilt, but to secure to them entrance into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">"kingdom of God"</a>. Unbaptized children, he thought, would after their death be excluded from the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">"kingdom of God"</a>, but not from "eternal life". This work, together with a still extant confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which bears witness to his childlike obedience, Pelagius sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, humbly begging at the same time that chance inaccuracies might be corrected by him who "holds the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and see of Peter". All this was addressed to <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a>, of whose death Pelagius had not yet heard. Caelestius, also, who meanwhile had changed his residence from Ephesus to Constantinople, but had been banished thence by the anti-Pelagian Bishop Atticus, took active steps toward his own rehabilitation. In 417 he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in person and laid at the feet of Zosimus a detailed confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (Fragments, P.L., XLV, 1718), in which he affirmed his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in all doctrines, "from the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Trinity of one God</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a>" (cf. St. Augustine, "De peccato orig.", xxiii).

<p>Highly pleased with this <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and obedience, Zosimus sent two different letters (P.L., XLV, 1719 sqq.) to the African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, saying that in the case of Caelestius Bishops Heros and Lazarus had proceeded without due circumspection, and that Pelagius too, as was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by his recent confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, had not swerved from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. As to Caelestius, who was then in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> charged the Africans either to revise their former sentence or to convict him of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in his own (the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a>) presence within two months. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> command struck Africa like a bomb-shell. In great haste a synod was convened at Carthage in November, 417, and writing to Zosimus, they urgently begged him not to rescind the sentence which his predecessor, <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a>, had pronounced against Pelagius and Caelestius, until both had confessed the necessity of interior grace for all salutary thoughts, words, and deeds. At last Zosimus came to a halt. By a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> of 21 March, 418, he assured them that he had not yet pronounced definitively, but that he was transmitting to Africa all documents bearing on Pelagianism in order to pave the way for a new, joint investigation. Pursuant to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> command, there was held on 1 May, 418, in the presence of 200 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the famous <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a>, which again branded Pelagianism as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in eight (or nine) canons (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchir.", 10th ed., 1908, 101-8). Owing to their importance they may be summarized: <ol> <li>Death did not come to Adam from a physical necessity, but through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <li>New-born children must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> on account of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>. <li>Justifying grace not only avails for the forgiveness of past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but also gives assistance for the avoidance of future <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. <li>The grace of Christ not only discloses the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">God's commandments</a>, but also imparts strength to will and execute them. <li>Without <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">God's grace</a> it is not merely more difficult, but absolutely impossible to perform <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>. <li>Not out of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, but in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must we confess ourselves to be sinners. <li>The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> refer the petition of the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Our Father</a>, "Forgive us our trespasses", not only to others, but also to themselves. <li>The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> pronounce the same supplication not from mere <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, but from truthfulness. <li>Some <a href="../cathen/04080b.htm">codices</a> containing a ninth canon (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, loc. cit., note 3): Children dying without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> do not go to a "middle place" (<em>medius locus</em>), since the non reception of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> excludes both from the "kingdom of heaven" and from "eternal life". </ol> <br>These clearly worded canons, which (except the last-named) afterwards came to be <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> binding on the universal Church, gave the death blow to Pelagianism; sooner or later it would bleed to death.

<p>Meanwhile, urged by the Africans (probably through a certain Valerian, who as <em>comes</em> held an influential position in <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>), the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> also took a hand in the dispute, the <a href="../cathen/07460a.htm">Emperor Honorius</a>, by <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> of 30 April, 418, from <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, banishing all Pelagians from the cities of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Whether Caelestius evaded the hearing before Zosimus, to which he was now bound, "by fleeing from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>" (St. Augustine, "Contra duas epist. Pelag.", II, 5), or whether he was one of the first to fall a victim to the imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of exile, cannot be satisfactorily settled from the sources. With regard to his later life, we are told that in 421 he again haunted <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> or its vicinity, but was expelled a second time by an imperial rescript (cf. P.L., XLV, 1750). It is further related that in 425 his petition for an audience with <a href="../cathen/03477c.htm">Celestine I</a> was answered by a third banishment (cf. P.L., LI, 271). He then sought refuge in the orient, where we shall meet him later. Pelagius could not have been included in the imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of exile from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. For at that time he undoubtedly resided in the Orient, since, as late as the summer of 418, he communicated with Pinianus and his wife Melania, who lived in Palestine (cf. Card. Rampolla, "Santa Melania giuniore", Rome, 1905). But this is the last information we have about him; he probably died in the orient. Having received the Acts of the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a>, Zosimus sent to all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the world his famous "Epistola tractoria" (418) of which unfortunately only fragments have come down to us. This <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> encyclical, a lengthy document, gives a minute account of the entire "causa Caelestii et Pelagii", from whose works it quotes abundantly, and categorically demands the condemnation of Pelagianism as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. The assertion that every <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the world was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to confirm this circular by his own signature, cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, it is more probable that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were required to transmit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a written agreement; if a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> refused to sign, he was deposed from his office and banished. A second and harsher <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a>, issued by the emperor on 9 June, 419, and addressed to Bishop Aurelius of Carthage (P.L., XLV, 1731), gave additional force to this measure. Augustine's triumph was complete. In 418, drawing the balance, as it were, of the whole controversy, he wrote against the heresiarchs his last great work, "De gratia Christi et de peccato originali" (P.L., XLIV, 359 sqq.).
<h2>The disputes of St. Augustine with Julian of Eclanum (419-428)</h2>

<p>Through the vigorous measures adopted in 418, Pelagianism was indeed condemned, but not crushed. Among the eighteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> who were exiled on account of their refusal to sign the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, Julian, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Eclanum, a city of Apulia now deserted, was the first to protest against the "Tractoria" of Zosimus. Highly <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> and skilled in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and dialectics, he assumed the leadership among the Pelagians. But to fight <em>for</em> Pelagianism now meant to fight <em>against</em> Augustine. The literary feud set in at once. It was probably Julian himself who denounced St. Augustine as <em>damnator nupitarum</em> to the influential <em>comes</em> Valerian in <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, a nobleman, who was very happily married. To meet the accusation, Augustine wrote, at the beginning of 419, an apology, "De nuptiis et concupiscentia libri II" (P.L., XLIV, 413 sqq.) and addressed it to Valerian. Immediately after (419 or 420), Julian published a reply which attacked the first book of Augustine's work and bore the title, "Libri IV ad Turbantium". But Augustine refuted it in his famous rejoinder, written in 421 or 422, "Contra Iulianum libri VI" (P.L., XLIV, 640 sqq.). When two Pelagian circulars, written by Julian and scourging the "Manichaean views" of the Antipelagians, fell into his hands, he attacked them energetically (420 or 421) in a work, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/02658a.htm">Boniface I</a>, "Contra duas epistolas Pelagianorum libri IV" (P.L., XLIV, 549 sqq.). Being driven from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Julian had found (not later than 421) a place of refuge in Cilicia with <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>. Here he employed his leisure in elaborating an extensive work, "Libri VIII ad Florum", which was wholly devoted to refuting the second book of Augustine's "De nuptiis et concupiscentia". Though composed shortly after 421, it did not come to the notice of St. Augustine until 427. The latter's reply, which quotes Julian's argumentations sentence for sentence and refutes them, was completed only as far as the sixth book, whence it is cited in patristic literature as "Opus imperfectum contra Iulianum" (P.L., XLV, 1049 sqq.). A comprehensive account of Pelagianism, which brings out into strong relief the diametrically opposed views of the author, was furnished by Augustine in 428 in the final chapter of his work, "De haeresibus" (P.L., XLII, 21 sqq.). Augustine's last writings published before his death (430) were no longer aimed against Pelagianism but against Semipelagianism.

<p>After the death of <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a> (428), <a href="../cathen/08557b.htm">Julian of Eclanum</a> left the hospitable city of Cilicia and in 429 we meet him unexpectedly in company with his fellow exiles Bishops Florus, Orontius, and Fabius, and the Court of the Patriarch Nestorius of Constantinople, who willingly supported the fugitives. It was here, too, in 429, that Caelestius emerged again as the <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</em> of the patriarch; this is his last appearance in history; for from now on all trace of him is lost. But the exiled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> did not long enjoy the protection of Nestorius. When Marius Mercator, a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> and friend of St. Augustine, who was then present in Constantinople, heard of the machinations of the Pelagians in the imperial city, he composed towards the end of 429 his "Commonitorium super nomine Caelestii" (P.L., XLVIII, 63 sqq.), in which he exposed the shameful life and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> character of Nestorius' wards. The result was that the Emperor Theodosius II decreed their banishment in 430. When the Ecumenical Council of Ephesus (431) repeated the condemnation pronounced by the West (cf. <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Concil. collect.", IV, 1337), Pelagianism was crushed in the East. According to the trustworthy report of Prosper of Aquitaine ("Chronic." ad a. 439, in P.L., LI, 598), <a href="../cathen/08557b.htm">Julian of Eclanum</a>, feigning repentance, tried to regain possession of his former <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, a plan which <a href="../cathen/14032a.htm">Sixtus III</a> (432-40) <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a> frustrated. The year of his death is uncertain. He seems to have died in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> between 441 and 445 during the reign of <a href="../cathen/15255b.htm">Valentinian III</a>.
<h2>Last traces of Pelagianism (429-529)</h2>

<p>After the Council of Ephesus (431), Pelagianism no more disturbed the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, so that the Greek historians of the fifth century do not even mention either the controversy or the names of the heresiarchs. But the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> continued to smoulder in the West and died out very slowly. The main centres were Gaul and Britain. About Gaul we are told that a synod, held probably at <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a> in 429, was compelled to take steps against the Pelagians. It also sent Bishops Germanus of Auxerre and Lupus of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a> to Britain to fight the rampant <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which received powerful support from two pupils of Pelagius, Agricola and Fastidius (cf. Caspari, "Letters, Treatises and Sermons from the two last Centuries of Ecclesiastical Antiquity", pp. 1-167, Christiana, 1891). Almost a century later, <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> was the centre of Pelagian intrigues. For the saintly Archbishop David of <a href="../cathen/10187d.htm">Menevia</a> participated in 519 in the Synod of Brefy, which directed its attacks against the Pelagians residing there, and after he was made <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of Cambria, he himself convened a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> against them. In <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> also Pelagius's "Commentary on St. Paul", described in the beginning of this article, was in use long afterwards, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by many <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> quotations from it. Even in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> traces can be found, not only in the <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Diocese of Aquileia</a> (cf. Garnier, "Opera Marii Mercat.", I, 319 sqq., Paris, 1673), but also in Middle <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; for the so-called "Liber Praedestinatus", written about 440 perhaps in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself, bears not so much the stamp of Semipelagianism as of genuine Pelagianism (cf. von Schubert, "Der sog. Praedestinatus, ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des Pelagianismus", Leipzig, 1903). A more detailed account of this work will be found under the article <a href="../cathen/12376b.htm">PREDESTINARIANISM</a>. It was not until the Second Synod of Orange (529) that Pelagianism breathed its last in the West, though that convention aimed its decisions primarily against Semipelagianism.
