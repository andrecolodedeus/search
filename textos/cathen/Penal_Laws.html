<h1>Penal Laws</h1>  

<p>This article treats of the penal legislation affecting <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in English-speaking countries since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. Separate heads are devoted to the penal laws: <blockquote><p>I. <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm#I">In England</a>; <br>II. <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm#II">In Scotland</a>; <br>III. <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm#III">In Ireland</a>; <br>IV. <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm#IV">In the American colonies</a>. </p></blockquote>

<h2 id="i">In England</h2>

<p>By a series of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, successive sovereigns and Parliaments from Elizabeth to George III, sought to prevent the practice of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. To the sanguinary <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> passed by Elizabeth further measures, sometimes inflicting new disqualifications and penalties, sometimes reiterating previous enactments, were added until this persecuting legislation made its effects felt in every department of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> lost not only freedom of worship, but civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as well; their estates, <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and sometimes even lives were at the mercy of any informer. The fact that these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were passed as political occasion demanded deprived them of any coherence or consistency; nor was any codification ever attempted, so that the task of summing up this long and complicated course of legislation is a difficult one. In his historical account of the penal laws, published at the time when partial relief had only just been granted, the eminent lawyer, Charles Butler, the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> to be called to the Bar after the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Relief Act of 1791, and the first to be appointed King's Counsel after the Catholic Emancipation Act, thought it best to group these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> under five heads: <ul><li>those which subjected <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to penalties and punishments for practising their religious worship; <li>those which punished them for not conforming to the Established Church (Statutes of Recusancy. <li>those regulating the penalties or disabilities attending the refusal to take the Oath of Supremacy (1559; 1605; 1689), the declarations against <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a> (Test Act, 1673) and against Popery (1678); <li>the act passed with respect to receiving the sacrament of the Lord's Supper; <li>statutes affecting landed <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>.</ul> For the present purpose, however, it seems preferable to adopt a chronological arrangement, which more clearly exhibits the historical development of the code and the state of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at any particular period.

<p>The Penal Laws began with the two Statutes of Supremacy and Uniformity by which Queen Elizabeth, in 1559, initiated her religious settlement; and her legislation falls into three divisions corresponding to three definitely marked periods: <ul><li>1558-70 when the Government trusted to the policy of enforcing conformity by fines and deprivations; <li>1570-80 from the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> to the time when the Government recognized the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reaction due to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; <li>from 1580 to the end of the reign.</ul> To the first period belong the Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity (I Eliz. 1 and 2) and the amending statute (5 Eliz. c. 1). By the Act of Supremacy all who maintained the spiritual or <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority of any foreign <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> were to forfeit all goods and chattels, both real and personal, and all <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> for the first offence, or in case the value of these was below 20 pounds, to be <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for one year; they were liable to the forfeitures of Praemunire for the second offence and to the penalties of high treason for the third offence. These penalties of Praemunire were: exclusion from the sovereign's protection, forfeiture of all lands and goods, arrest to answer to the Sovereign and Council. The penalties assigned for high treason were: <ul><li>drawing, hanging and quartering; <li>corruption of blood, by which heirs became incapable of inheriting honours and offices; and, lastly <li>forfeiture of all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>.</ul> These first <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> were made stricter by the amending act (5 Eliz. c.1) which declared that to maintain the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in any way was punish able by penalties of Praemunire for the first offence and of high treason, though without corruption of blood, for the second. All who refused the Oath of Supremacy were subjected to the like penalties. The Act of Uniformity, primarily designed to secure outward conformity in the use of the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Anglican Book of Common Prayer</a>, was in effect a penal statute, as it punished all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who used any other service by deprivation and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, and everyone who refused to attend the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> service by a fine of twelve pence for each ommission. It should be remembered that the amount must be greatly multiplied to give their modern equivalent.

<p>Coming to the legislation of the second period, there are two Acts directed against the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">Excommunication</a>.: <ul><li>13 Eliz. c.1, which, among other enactments, made it high treason to affirm that the queen ought not to enjoy the Crown, or to declare her to be a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a>, and <li>13 Eliz. c. 2, which made it high treason to put into effect any <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>, to absolve or reconcile any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or to be so absolved or reconciled, or to procure or publish any <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> or writing whatsoever.</ul>

<p>The penalties of Praemunire were enacted against all who brought into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> or who gave to others <em>Agnus Dei</em> or articles blessed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> or by any one through faculties from him.

<p>A third act, 13 Eliz. c. 3, which was designed to stop <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from taking refuge abroad, declared that any subject departing the realm without the queen's licence, and not returning within six months, should forfeit the profits of his lands during life and all his goods and chattels. The third and most severe group of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> begins with the "Act to retain the Queen's Majesty's subjects in their obedience" (23 Eliz. c. 1), passed in 1581. This made it high treason to reconcile anyone or to be reconciled to "the Romish religion", prohibited Mass under penalty of a fine of two hundred marks and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for one year for the celebrant, and a fine of one hundred marks and the same <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for those who heard the Mass. This act also increased the penalty for not attending the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> service to the sum of twenty pounds a month, or <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> till the fine be paid, or till the offender went to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant Church</a>. A further penalty of ten pounds a month was inflicted on anyone keeping a schoolmaster who did not attend the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> service. The schoolmaster himself was to be <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for one year.



<p>The climax of Elizabeth's <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was reached in 1585 by the "Act against Jesuits, Seminary priests and other such like disobedient persons" (27 Eliz. c. 2). This statute, under which most of the <a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyrs</a> suffered, made it high treason for any <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> or any <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to be in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> at all, and felony for any one to harbour or relieve them. The penalties of Praemunire were imposed on all who sent assistance to the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> abroad, and a fine of 100 pounds for each offence on those who sent their children overseas without the royal licence.

<p>So far as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were concerned, the effect of all this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a> may be summed up as follows: For any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> before the accession of Elizabeth it was high treason after 1563 to maintain the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for the second time, or to refuse the <a href="../cathen/11177a.htm">oath of supremacy</a> for the second time; after 1571, to receive or use any <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> or form of reconciliation; after 1581, to absolve or reconcile anyone to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or to be absolved or reconciled. For <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> it was high treason to be in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> at all after 1585. Under this statute, over 150 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> died on the scaffold between 1581 and 1603, exclusive of Erizabeth's earlier victims.

<p>The last of Elizabeth's <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> was the "Act for the better discovery of wicked and seditious persons terming themselves Catholics, but being rebellious and traitorous subjects" (35 Eliz. c. 2). Its effect was to prohibit all <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">recusants</a> from removing more than five miles from their place of abode, and to order all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> suspected of being <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> or <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and not answering satisfactorily, to be <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> till they did so. The hopes of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> on the accession of James I were soon dispelled, and during his reign (1603-25) five very oppressive measures were added to the statute-book. In the first year of his reign there was passed the "Act for the due execution of the statute against Jesuits, seminary priests, etc." (I Jac. 1, iv) by which all Elizabeth's <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> were confirmed with additional aggravations. Thus <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> going beyond seas to any <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> seminary were rendered incapable of purchasing or retaining any lands or goods in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; the penalty of 100 pounds on everyone sending a child or ward out of the realm, which had been enacted only for Elizabeth's reign, was now made perpetual; and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> schoolmasters not holding a licence from the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> were fined forty shillings a day, as were their employers. One slight relief was obtained in the exemption of one-third of the estate of a convicted <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">recusant</a> from liabilities to penalties; but against this must be set the provision that retained the remaining two-thirds after the owner's death till all his previous fines had been paid. Even then these two-thirds were only to be restored to the heir provided he was not himself a <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">recusant</a>.

<p>The carefully arranged "discovery" of the <a href="../cathen/07081b.htm">Gunpowder Plot</a> in 1605 was followed by two <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of particularly savage character. These were "An Act for the better discovering and repressing of Popish Recusants" (3 Jac. I, iv) and "An Act to prevent and avoid dangers which may grow by Popish Recusants" (3. Jac. 1, v). The first of these two wicked <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> enacted that all convicted <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">recusants</a> should communicate once a year in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> church under penalties of 20 pounds for the first omission, 40 pounds for the second, and 60 pounds for the third. Moreover the king was to be allowed to refuse the penalty of 20 pounds per month for non-attendance at the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> church, and to take in its place all the personal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and two-thirds of the real <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the offender. But the main point of this Act was the new Oath of Allegiance which it prescribed, and which was subsequently condemned by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Yet all who refused it were to be subjected to the penalties of Praemunire, except married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who were to be <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the common jail. Finally, every householder of whatever religion was liable to a fine of 10 pounds a month for each guest or servant who failed to attend the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> church.

<p>The second Act was even worse, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> historian <a href="../cathen/14723b.htm">Tierney</a> justly says of it that it "exceeded in cruelty all that had hitherto been devised for the oppression of the devoted <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>". it prohibited <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">recusants</a> from remaining within ten miles of the city of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, a provision which it was impossible to carry out; or to remove more than five miles from their place of residence till they had obtained licence from four magistrates and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> or lieutenant of the county. They were disabled from practising as lawyers, physicians, apothecaries; from holding office in any court or corporation; from holding commissions in the army or navy, or any office of emolument under the State; from discharging the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of executors, administrators, or guardians. Any married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who had not received the sacrament in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> church for a year before her husband's death forfeited two-thirds of her <a href="../cathen/05145c.htm">dower</a>, two-thirds of her jointure, and was debarred from acting as executrix to her husband or claiming any part of his goods. Husbands and wives, if married otherwise than by a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> minister in a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> church, were each deprived of all interest in the lands or <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the other. They were fined 100 pounds for omitting to have each of their children <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptised</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> minister within a month of birth. All <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> going or being sent beyond the seas without a special licence from the king or Privy Council were incapable of benefitting by gift, descent, or devise, till they returned and took the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance; and in the meantime the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was to be held by the nearest <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> heir. And, lastly, every convicted recusant was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> from the Established Church, with the result that they were debarred from maintaining or defending any personal action or suit in the civil courts. Their houses were liable to be searched at any time, their arms and ammunition to be seized, and any books or furniture which were deemed <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> to be destroyed.

<p>The two remaining <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of James I were "An Act to cause persons to be naturalized or restored in blood to conform and take the oath of allegiance and supremacy" (7 Jac. 1, ii) and "An Act for the reformation of married recusant women, and administration of the oath of allegiance to all civil, military, ecclesiastical and professional persons" (7 Jac. I, vi). The chief effect of this latter act was to cause the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to be offered to all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> over eighteen, and to empower the committal to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of any <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">recusant</a> married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, unless her husband paid 10 pounds a month for her liberty.

<p>During the reign of Charles I, the only penal statute was a short "Act to restrain the passing or sending of any to be Popishly bred beyond the Seas" (3 Car. 1, iii), which reenacted the provisions in 3 Jac. 1, c. 5, adding that offenders should be disabled from prosecuting any legal actions in law or in equity; from acting as guardian, executor, or administrator; receiving any legacy or deed of gift, or bearing any office within the realm. Moreover, such offender was to forfeit all his lands and personal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. After the Restoration in 1660, an attempt was made by Charles II, not unmindful of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had made in the Stuart cause, to obtain a repeal of the Penal Laws, and a committee of the House of Lords was appointed to examine and report on the question. The matter, however, was allowed to drop; and in the following year both Houses of Parliament joined in petitioning the King to issue a proclamation against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Further efforts on the part of the king came to nothing, and matters remained on the same footing till the latter part of his reign, when new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of a harassing nature were passed. With the exception of the Corporation Act (13 Car. II, St. 2, c. 1) which was not aimed against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> directly, but which provided that no <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> could hold any municipal office without taking the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy and receiving the sacrament in the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> church, no new measures were introduced till 1673, when Parliament passed the Test Act (25 Car. II, ii). This required all officers, civil and military, to take the same Oaths and to make the Declaration against <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a>. Five years later another Act was passed (30 Car. II, St. 2), which excluded all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from sitting or voting in Parliament, by requiring every member of either House to take the two <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> and to make the blasphemous Declaration against Popery. From this statute, which was entitled "An Act for the more effectual preserving the King's person and government, by disabling Papists from sitting in either House of Parliament", a special exception was made in favour of the Duke of York, afterwards James II.

<p>With the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">Revolution of 1688</a> began a new era of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. The "Act for further preventing the growth of Popery" (11 &amp; 12 Gul. III, 4), passed in 1699, introduced a fresh hardship into the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> by offering a reward of 100 pounds for the apprehension of any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, with the result that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were placed at the mercy of common informers who harassed them for the sake of gain, even when the Government would have left them in peace. It was further enacted that any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> exercising episcopal or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> functions, or any <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> keeping a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, should be <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for life; that any <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> over eighteen not taking the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance, or making the Declaration against Popery, should be incapable of inheriting or purchasing any lands; and any lands devised to a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> who refused to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> should pass to the next of kin who happened to be a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. A reward of 100 pounds was also offered for the conviction of any <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> sending children to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> abroad. The cruel operation of this Act, which made itself felt throughout the ensuing century, was extended by a measure passed under Queen Anne (12 Anne, St. 2, c. 14), though <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were not generally molested during her reign.

<p>The last penal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> to be enacted were those of George I. By I Geo., I, St. 2, c. 13, the <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanoverian</a> Succession Oaths were to be taken by all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to whom they were tendered, under penalty of all the forfeitures to which "popish <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">recusant</a> convicts" were liable. The Stuart rising of 1715 was followed by another Act (I Geo., I.St.2.c.50) appointing commissioners to inquire into the estates of popish <a href="../cathen/12677a.htm">recusants</a> with a view to confiscating two-thirds of each estate. The scope of "An Act to oblige papists to register their names and real estates" (I. Geo. I. St. 2. c. 55) is sufficiently indicated by its title. It added to the expense of all transactions in land, the more galling as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were doubly taxed under the annual land-tax acts. (See also 4 G. III, c. 60.) In 1722 was passed "An Act for granting an aid to his Majesty by levying a Tax upon Papists" (9 Geo., I, 18), by which the sum of one hundred thousand pounds was wrung from the impoverished <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Throughout the reign of George II (1727-60) there were no further additions to the penal code and under his successor, George III, (1760-1820), the work of repeal was begun.

<p>Even this lengthy enumeration is not absolutely exhaustive, and the Acts here cited contain many minor enactments of a vexatious nature. The task of repeal was a long, slow, gradual, and complicated one, the chief measures of relief being three: The First <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Relief Act of 1778, which enabled <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to inherit and purchase land and repealed the Act of William III, rewarding the conviction of priests; the second Relief Act of 1791, which relieved all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who took the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> therein prescribed from the operation of the Penal Code (see Ward, 'Dawn of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Revival" viii, xiv-xvi); and the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829. The only disqualifications against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> which appear to be still in force are those which prohibit the sovereign from being or marrying a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, or any <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> subject from holding the offices of Lord Chancellor or Lord Lieutenant of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>.

<h2 id="ii">In Scotland</h2>

<p>The first penal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> were enacted by the Scottish Parliament of 1560, which, on 14 August, passed three <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>; the first abolishing the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the second repealing all former <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> in favor of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the third providing that all who said or heard Mass should be punished for the first offence by the confiscation of their goods and by corporal penalties, for the second by banishment from <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, for the third by death. A temporary relaxation of these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> was due to <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Queen of Scots</a>, and a statute was even passed in 1567 giving liberty to every Scotsman to live according to his own religion; but shortly after the Queen's marriage with Bothwell a proclamation was extorted from her on 23 May, 1567, by which severe penalties were renewed against all who refused to conform to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. After Mary's deposition the Parliament of 1568 passed further acts ratifying the establishment of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, and prohibiting the exercise of any other <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>. Lennox's Parliament (1571) decreed the apprehension of all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> possessing <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a> or <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> or gifts and provisions of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> carried on under these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> by the Privy Council and by the General Assembly was very severe. The Privy Council issued several proclamations during the next half-century enforcing the penal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>, forbidding the harbouring of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, ordering <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to withdraw their children from <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges abroad, and rendering husbands liable for the acts of their wives done in support of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause. A commission issued in July, 1629, ordered that, should <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> take refuge in fortified places, the commissioners should "follow, hunt and pursue them with fire and sword". Though in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> there were fewer <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdoms</a> than in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> or <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, yet the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> fell even more heavily on the rank and file of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and in some respects they suffered outrages not paralleled in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, such as the simultaneous expulsion of all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from their homes which was ordered and carried out in 1629-30. But there were times of comparative tranquillity when the rigour of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was not enforced.

<p>At the close of the seventeenth century fresh <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> were passed. In May, 1700, an Act of Parliament offered a reward of five hundred merks for the conviction of any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>; the same statute disabled <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from inheriting <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> or <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> their children. After the Act of Union, in 1707, the Penal Laws were still enforced. In addition to the provisions already recorded and other sufferings which they shared with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, there were galling restrictions peculiar to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. The purchase or dissemination of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> books was forbidden under pain of banishment and forfeiture of personal <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. They could not be governors, school-masters, guardians or factors, and any one who employed them as such was fined a thousand merks. They were fined five hundred merks for teaching "any art, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> or exercise of any sort". Any <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> who <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> forfeited his whole hereditable estate to the nearest <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> heir.

<p>The first repeal of the Penal Code was effected by the Act for the relief of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scottish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, which received the royal assent in May, 1793, and practically complete liberty was granted to them under the provisions of the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829.

<h2 id="iii">In Ireland</h2>

<p>Although the penal laws of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> were passed by a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Parliament and aimed at depriving <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, such <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were not the outcome of religious motives only. They often came from a desire to possess the lands of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, from impatience at their long resistance, from the contempt of a ruling for a subject race. (See <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">IRELAND</a>, <em>The Anglo-Normans</em>.) When <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> broke with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> sectarian rancour came to embitter racial differences. The English Parliament passed the Act of Supremacy, making Henry head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Parliament was less compliant, and did not pass the bill till the legislative powers of the representatives of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> had been taken away. And though the Act of Supremacy (1536) was accepted by so many <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> chiefs, they were not followed by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or people in their apostasy. The <a href="../cathen/10455a.htm">suppression of monasteries</a> followed entailing the loss of so much <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and even of many lives. Yet little progress was made with the new doctrines either in Henry's reign or in that of his successor, and Mary's restoration of the Faith led the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Elizabeth to again resort to penal laws. In 1559 the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Parliament passed both the Act of Supremacy and the Act of Uniformity, the former prescribing to all officers the Oath of Supremacy, the latter prohibiting the Mass and commanding the public use of the <a href="../cathen/02678c.htm">Book of Common Prayer</a>. Whoever refused the Oath of Supremacy was dismissed from office, and whoever refused to attend the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> service was fined 12 pence for each offence. A subsequent viceregal proclamation ordered all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to leave Dublin and prohibited the use of images, candles, and beads. For some time these Acts and proclamations were not rigorously enforced; but after 1570, when Elizabeth was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, toleration ceased; and the hunting down of the Earl of Desmond, the desolation of Munster, the torturing of O'Hurley and others, showed how merciless the queen and her <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> could be. Elizabeth disliked Parliaments and had but two in her reign in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. She governed by proclamation, as did her successor, James, and it was under a proclamation (1611) that the blood of <a href="../cathen/11207a.htm">O'Devany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Down, was shed. In the next reign there were periods of toleration followed by the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> promises of Strafford and the attempted spoliation of Connaught, until at last the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> took up arms.

<p>Cromwell disliked Parliaments as much as Elizabeth or James, and when he had extinguished the Rebellion of 1641, he abolished the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Parliament, giving <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> a small representation at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a>. It was by Acts of this Westminster Parliament that the Cromwellian settlement was carried out, and that so many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were outlawed. As for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, no mercy was shown them under Cromwellian rule. They were ordered to leave <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> if they refused, or deported to the Arran Isles or to Barbadoes, and those who sheltered them at home were liable to the penalty of death. To such an extent was the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> carried that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches were soon in ruins, a thousand <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were driven into exile, and not a single <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> remained in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> but the old and helpless <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08642a.htm">Kilmore</a>. With the accession of Charles II the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> looked for a restoration of lands and liberties; but the hopes raised by the <a href="../cathen/01112a.htm">Act of Settlement</a> (1663) were finally dissipated by the Act of Explanation (1665), and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, plundered by the Cromwellians, were denied even the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of a trial. The English Parliament at the same time prohibited the importation into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> cattle, sheep, or pigs. The king favoured toleration of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a>, but was overruled by the bigotry of the Parliament in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and of the viceroy, Ormond, in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; and if the reign of Charles saw some toleration, it also saw the judicial <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of <a href="../cathen/12169b.htm">Venerable Oliver Plunkett</a> and a proclamation by Ormond in 1678, ordering that all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should leave the country, and that all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> should be closed.

<p>The triumph of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> under James II was short-lived. But even when William of Orange had triumphed, toleration of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> was expected. For the Treaty of Limerick (1691) gave the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> "such privileges as they enjoyed in the reign of Charles II"; and William was to obtain from the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Parliament a further relaxation of the penal laws in existence. The treaty was soon broken. The English Parliament, presuming to legislate for <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, enacted that no one should sit in the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Parliament without taking the Oath of Supremacy and subscribing to a declaration against <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Parliament, filled with slaves and bigots, accepted this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a>: <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were thus excluded; and in spite of the declared wishes of King William, the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Parliament not only refused to relax the Penal Laws in existence but embarked on fresh penal legislation. Session after session for nearly fifty years, new and more galling fetters were forged, until at last the Penal Code was complete, and well merited the description of Burke:<blockquote><p>as well fitted for the oppression, impoverishment and degradation of a feeble people and the debasement in them of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> itself as ever proceeded from the perverted ingenuity of man. </p></blockquote>

<p>All <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, deans, vicars-general, and <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> were to leave the country and if they returned, to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. Secular <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at home could remain if they were registered; in 1709, however, they were required to take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a> which no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> could conscientiously take, so that registration ceased to be a protection. They could not set up <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> at home nor resort to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> abroad, nor could they receive legacies for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> charities, nor have on their churches steeple, cross, or bell.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> were no better off than the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the matter of civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. They could not set up <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, nor teach in such, nor go abroad to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. They were excluded from Parliament, from the corporations, from the army and navy, from the legal profession, and from all civil offices. They could not act as sheriffs, or under sheriffs, or as jurors, or even as constables. They could not have more than two <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> apprentices in their trade; they could not carry arms, nor own a horse worth more than 5 pounds; they were excluded even from residence in the larger corporate towns. To bury their dead in an old ruined <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> involved a penalty of ten pounds. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> workman refusing to work on <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> holy days was to be whipped; and there was the same punishment for those who made <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> to holy wells. No <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> could act as guardian to an infant, nor as director of the Bank of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; nor could he marry a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who performed such a marriage <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> could not acquire land, nor buy it, nor hold a mortgage on it; and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> landlord was bound at death to leave his estate to his children in equal shares. During life, if the wife or son of such became a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, she or he at once obtained separate maintenance. The law presumed every <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> to be faithless, disloyal, and untruthful, assumed him to exist only to be punished, and the ingenuity of the Legislature was exhausted in discovering new methods of repression. Viceroys were constantly appealed to to give no countenance to Popery; magistrates, to execute the penal laws; degraded <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irishmen</a> called priest-hunters were rewarded for spying upon their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and degraded <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> were rewarded with a government pension. The wife was thus encouraged to disobey her husband, the child to flout his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, the friend to turn traitor to his friend. These <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> legislators in possession of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> lands wished to make all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> helpless and poor. Without <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> they must soon be without <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and without <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> they must necessarily go to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. These hopes however <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> vain. Students went to foreign colleges, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> came from abroad, facing <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> and death. The schoolmaster taught under a sheltering hedge, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> by stealth watched over by the people and in spite of priest-hunter and penal laws. Nor were the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> won over by such <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> as they saw, men without <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and often without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not unlike those described by Spenser in Elizabeth's day &#151; "of fleshy incontinency, <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greedy</a> <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and disordered lives". In other respects the Penal Laws succeeded. They made the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> helpless, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, and poor, without the strength to rebel, the hope of redress, or even the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to complain.

<p>At last the tide turned. Too poor to excite the cupidity of their oppressors, too feeble to rebel, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> had nevertheless shown that they would not become <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; and the repression of a feeble people, merely for the sake of repression, had tarnished the name of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and alienated her friends among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> nations. In these circumstances the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Parliament began to retrace its steps, and concessions were made, slowly and grudgingly. At first the Penal Laws ceased to be rigorously enforced, and then in 1771, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were allowed to take leases of unreclaimed bog for sixty-one years. Three years later they were allowed to substitute an Oath of Allegiance for the Oath of Supremacy; and in 1778 Gardiner's Act allowed them to take leases of land for 999 years, and also allowed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> landlords to leave their estates to one son, instead of having, as hitherto, to divide between all. In 1782 a further Act enabled <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to set up <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with the leave of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the place, enabling them also to own horses in the same way as <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and further permitting <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to reside in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were also allowed to act as guardians to children. Grattan favoured complete equality between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, but the bigots in Parliament were too strong, and among them were the so-called patriot leaders, Charlemont and Flood. Not till 1792 was there a further Act allowing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to marry <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, to practise at the bar, and to set up <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> without obtaining a licence from the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. These concessions were scorned by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Committee, long charged with the care of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests, and which had lately passed from the feeble leadership of Lord Kenmare to the more capable leadership of John Keogh. The new French Republic had also become a menace to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and English <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> dreaded having <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> discontented. For these reasons the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Relief Bill of 1793 became law. This gave <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> the parliamentary and municipal franchise, enabled them to become jurors, magistrates, sheriffs, and officers in the army and navy. They might carry arms under certain conditions, and they were admitted to the degrees of Trinity College, though not to its emoluments or higher honours. Two years later the advent of Lord Fitzwilliam as viceroy was regarded as the herald of complete religious equality. But Pitt suddenly changed his mind, and, having resolved on a legislative union, it suited his purpose better to stop further concession. Then came the recall of Fitzwilliam, the rapid rise of the United <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Society with revolutionary objects, the rebellion of 1798, and the Union of 1800.

<p>From the Imperial Parliament the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> expected immediate emancipation, remembering the promises of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, but Pitt shamefully broke his word, and emancipation was delayed till 1829. Nor would it have come even then but for the matchless leadership of O'Connell, and because the only alternative to concession was civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The manner of concession was grudging. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were admitted to Parliament, but the forty-shilling free-holders were disfranchised, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> banished, other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders made incapable of receiving charitable bequests, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> penalized for assuming <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> titles and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> for appearing outside their churches in their vestments. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were debarred from being either viceroy or lord chancellor of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. The law regarding <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> has not been enforced, but the viceroy must still be a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. Nor was it till the last half-century that a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> could be lord chancellor, <a href="../cathen/11224c.htm">Lord O'Hagan</a>, who died in 1880, being the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> to fill that office since the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">Revolution of 1688</a>.

<h2 id="iv">Penal laws in the English colonies in America</h2>
<h3>Anglican establishments</h3>

<p>The first Virginia Charter in 1606 established the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a>. The second, in 1609, repeated the terms of the establishment and prescribed the Oath of Supremacy. In support of the Establishment, the draconian <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of Governor Dale in 1611 were directed mainly against the moral laxity of the colonists and were soon abrogated. When lawmaking passed to the Colonial Assembly the Establishment was maintained, but penalizing <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were still directed towards the moral uplift of the church. Intolerance of dissent was latent and implicit. Lord Baltimore, refusing as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> to acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> supremacy of the king, in 1628 was denied temporary residence in the colony. Following this incident a new Act of Uniformity passed the Assembly, fining absentees from service. Another, in 1642, specifically disenfranchised <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and enforced the expulsion, within five days, of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> coming to the colony. Under Governor Berkeley an Act, directed mainly against the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritan</a> franchise, was limited to church members. Men making active profession of an alien <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were banished. The General Court made provision for a general church tax to be levied and collected by civil officers. In 1631 came the famous law admitting only church members to civic freedom. In 1635 the magistrates were given inquisitional powers over the churches themselves. Congregationalism became law and <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> were identical. Colonists were compelled to live within easy distance of meeting houses. Heresy was punished by banishment. Contempt toward <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> merited magisterial reproof, a fine, or standing placarded on a block. In 1656 denial of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> meant whipping or banishment, and as late as 1697 a law against "Blasphemy and <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheism</a>" mentions as penalties the pillory, whipping, and boring the tongue with red-hot irons. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of course were not suffered to live in the colony, and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, if banished, were to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> on return. The latter law was never enforced, though latent intolerance may be detected in such an ordinance as that of 1659 making the observance of <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> a punishable offence. The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/06304b.htm">Quakers</a> and the inflicting of the <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death penalty</a> in four instances brought about a rebellion within the colony which, with the endeavour of the Crown to force recognition of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a>, worked the initial movement in undermining the theocracy. With the appointment of a royal governor the franchise was broadened, Episcopalianism was established, and it was decreed in 1691 that "forever hereafter there shall be liberty of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> allowed in the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (except Papists)".

<p>In Connecticut, Congregationalism under its famous instrument, the Saybrook Platform, became the State religion. But toleration was unstintingly allowed to every other licensed religion. Even <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against <a href="../cathen/06304b.htm">Quakers</a>, apparently unenforced, imposed penalties not upon them but upon the communities that harboured them; while the universal "except Papists" phrase is significantly lacking, though in 1743 a law allowed dissenters "being <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>" to apply for relief.

<p>The short-lived attempt of the settlement at New Haven to found a theocratic colony based upon the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a> is interesting only in its failure. The famous "Blue Laws", now known to be ironic forgeries, were not much more severe than the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> penalties enforced by the New Haven Legislature, according to their own records. The colony was soon incorporated with that of <a href="../cathen/04253b.htm">Connecticut</a>, in whose democratic tolerance it was speedily absorbed.

<p>The first settlers of <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a> established a broadly tolerant congregationalism which allowed civil privileges to be independent of religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritan</a> establishment was firmly planted throughout the years of the colony's union with <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>. To the influence of this union, perhaps, may be traced the single example of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in the colony, that against three <a href="../cathen/06304b.htm">Quakers</a> in 1659. In 1679 the union with <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a> was dissolved, and a royal governor sought, unsuccessfully, to enforce the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a>. The assembly of 1680 fixed the Congregational Establishment. The franchise was limited to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and subsequent <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> notably those of 1692, 1702 &amp; 1714, defined the union of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, allowing the constable to collect the church tax-that from dissenters to go to the support of their own <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. Under the Toleration Act of 1689 all citizens were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to make a declaration against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h3>Changing establishments</h3>

<p>Under the Duke of York all churches were established with governmental <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, though those of power and induction were placed in the governor's hands. Persecution for <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience's</a> sake seems unrecorded. Much of this tolerant attitude is due to the older <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> foundation. It was renewed in the "Charter of Liberties", passed by the Assembly in 1683. When the Duke of York came to the throne a faint attempt was made to establish the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a>. Later the council suspended "all Roman Catholics from Command and Places of Trust", and the franchise was soon confined to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. This attitude was given universal royal warrant under the Great Toleration Act, and a supposititious Established Church existed in New York to the American Revolution, suffering the same kind of political opposition that the Establishment endured in <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a> and the Carolinas. The Establishment seized <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> and banished Moravians, under the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that they were "disguised Papists", though its powers began to wane before the American Revolution.

<p>The Palatinate of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> under the Baltimores furnishes, with the Colony of Rhode Island, the first example in history of a complete separation Of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> with religious tolerance. Religious freedom was proclaimed in the famous "Act for Church Liiberties", passed by the assembly and practically carried out. Under this <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> toleration a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> was fined for "interfering by opprobrious reproaches with two Protestants", and <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were refused the privileges of the canon law. The Toleration Act of 1649 denied toleration only to non-Christians and <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarians</a>, and imposed upon every resident an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> declaring for liberty of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. The outcome of the disgraceful <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritan</a> "Plot" resulted in the voiding of the charter, the erection of <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a> as a royal province, and the Episcopal Establishment in 1692. The majority of the colonists were so overwhelmingly non-episcopal that the legislatures never seem to have insisted upon conformity, though they compelled church support. Against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> alone <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> endured. They were deprived of all civil and religious <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> &#151; the latter only in private homes; the Law of 1704 laid a tax of twenty shillings on every <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> servant imported; while in 1715 it was enacted that children of a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> father and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mother could, in case of the father's death, be taken from the mother. However, the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> was erected without opposition in 1763, though the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the franchise were not extended to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> until the American Revolution put an end to all penal enactments.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> and <a href="../cathen/06304b.htm">Quaker</a> settlers of the Jerseys, under their proprietors, were granted entire liberty of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. But with the assumption of the provinces, the Crown seems to have assumed that, <em>per se</em>, the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> was established, though no specific act to that effect seems to have been passed. At any rate, excepting troubles with <a href="../cathen/06304b.htm">Quakers</a> in the French Wars, the annals of <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a> are free from records of official <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, though <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were disenfranchised when Jersey became a royal province. Georgia with its twoscore years of provincial history excluded "Papists" from its confines. The <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> entered with the Crown and was formally, though unsuccessfully, established by the colonial legislature in 1758, the settlement remaining from the beginning indifferent toward Dissent.
<h3>The Free Colonies</h3>

<p>Two colonies, those of <a href="../cathen/13020a.htm">Rhode Island</a> and <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> (with its offspring, Delaware) proclaimed absolute separation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. The former laboured for long under the accusation of denying citizenship to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but this charge is probably based on an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the committee that prepared the revised <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> for the public printer; while the <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> commonwealth departs from the principles of <a href="../cathen/13020a.htm">Rhode Island</a> in restricting the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to hold office to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>. In spite of the protest of Penn, that part of the Test Oath required under the great Toleration Act, excluding <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, was adopted by the colonial assembly in 1705 and endured until the Revolution, when the Disarming Act was passed, but never enforced.
