<h1>Penitential Redemptions</h1>  

<p>Penitential redemptions are the substitution of exercises (especially alms-deeds), either easier or extending over a shorter period, for works of penance imposed according to the penitential canons. These redemptions allow an alleviation, or a shortening of the time of penance; they thus resemble an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, and have a place in the history of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. Among the Anglo-Saxons and the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, as manifested by their penitential books, the fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was reparation in proportion to the number and gravity of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as it were a <em>weregild</em> paid to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The confessor imposed a certain number of penitential acts, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, flagellations, alms-deeds etc., extending over a more or less considerable period; hence arose quite naturally the desire to condense the penance into a shorter time. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> might fix them in each case, but the penitential books show that there actually was a sort of scale in current use. Three things were considered in determining the new works: the penances already imposed, the difficulty of the penitent's accomplishing them, and finally his material condition, especially in the case of alms-deeds. Thus one unable to fast could replace <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalter</a> (fifty psalms); an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of twenty <em>solidi</em> (for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, ten <em>solidi</em> or even less) replaced <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> of seven weeks (<em>a carina</em>). A penance of a week, a quarantine, or a year might be accomplished in a short time by accumulating psalters, genuflexions, <em>palmat&oelig;</em> (blows on the breast with the palm of the hand), or by condensing two days of slight into one of severe <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. These substitutions assumed numerous combinations, and the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> canons (Wasserschleben, "Die Bussordnungen", Halle, 1851, 193) show nine methods of accomplishing a year's penance in a short time. It was even attempted to have the penance performed by others (cf. "Leges" or "P&oelig;nitentiale" of Eadger in <a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a>, "Concilia", VI, i, 659 sq.), but these substitutions, accessible only to the great, were a contradiction of penance and were severely condemned (cf. Conc. of Clovesho of 747, cans. xxvi-xxvii). The redemptions considered in the penitential books had only practical and not official value; however, they were officially adopted by several councils. Thus the Council of Tribur of 895 (can. lvi), in determining the penance for a <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">homicide</a>, authorizes the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> (while travelling or at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>) of the fast on Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday by paying a <em>denier</em>, or by caring for three poor. Eventually these redemptions were offered indiscriminately to all, especially at the Council of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> of 1095 (can. ii), when the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> was suggested as a ransom from all penance. This was the modern <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, save that in the case of an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> the penance to be redeemed has not been imposed on <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, but to the proposed work is attached by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority a reduction of penitential satisfaction. (See <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">INDULGENCES</a>.)
