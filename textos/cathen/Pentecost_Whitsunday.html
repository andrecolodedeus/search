<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pentecost (Whitsunday)</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">universal</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which commemorates the Descent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>, fifty days after the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Christ</a>, on the ancient <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish</a> festival called the "feast of weeks" or <a href="../cathen/11661a.htm">Pentecost</a> (<a href="../bible/exo034.htm#vrs22">Exodus 34:22</a>; <a href="../bible/deu016.htm#vrs10">Deuteronomy 16:10</a>). <em>Whitsunday</em> is so called from the white garments which were worn by those who were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptised</a> during the <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigil</a>; <em>Pentecost</em> ("Pfingsten" in <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German</a>), is the Greek for "the fiftieth" (day after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>).

<p>Whitsunday, as a <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">Christian feast</a>, dates back to the first century, although there is no evidence that it was observed, as there is in the case of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>; the passage in <a href="../bible/1co016.htm#vrs8">1 Corinthians 16:8</a> probably refers to the <a href="../cathen/11661a.htm">Jewish feast</a>. This is not surprising, for the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a>, originally of only one day's duration, fell on a <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a>; besides it was so closely bound up with <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> that it appears to be not much more than the termination of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Paschal tide</a>.</p>

<p>That Whitsunday belongs to the <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">Apostolic</a> times is stated in the seventh of the (interpolated) fragments attributed to <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Iren&aelig;us</a>. In <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (<a href="../fathers/0321.htm#chapter19"><em>On Baptism</em> 19</a>) the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">festival</a> appears as already well established. The <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gallic</a> pilgrim gives a detailed account of the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> manner in which it was observed at <a href="../cathen/08355a.htm">Jerusalem</a> ("Peregrin. Silvi&aelig;", ed. Geyer, iv). The <a href="../cathen/01636a.htm">Apostolic Constitutions</a> (<a href="../fathers/07155.htm#part20">Book V, Part 20</a>) say that Pentecost lasts one week, but in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a> it was not kept with an <a href="../cathen/11204a.htm">octave</a> until at quite a late date. It appears from <a href="../cathen/02512a.htm">Berno of Reichenau</a> (d. 1048) that it was a debatable point in his time whether Whitsunday ought to have an <a href="../cathen/11204a.htm">octave</a>. At present it is of equal rank with <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigil</a> formerly the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> who remained from <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, consequently the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> on Saturday are similar to those on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">office</a> of Pentecost has only one <a href="../cathen/11087b.htm">Nocturn</a> during the entire week. At <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">Terce</a> the <a href="../cathen/15341a.htm">"Veni Creator"</a> is sung instead of the usual <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>, because at the third hour the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> descended. The <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> has a <a href="../cathen/12481d.htm">Sequence</a>, <a href="../cathen/15342a.htm">"Veni Sancte Spiritus"</a> the authorship of which by some is ascribed to King Robert of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04134a.htm">colour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> is red, symbolic of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> or of the tongues of fire. Formerly the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> courts did not sit during the entire week, and servile work was forbidden. A <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> (1094) limited this prohibition to the first three days of the week. The <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> rest of Tuesday was abolished in 1771, and in many missionary territories also that of Monday; the latter was abrogated for the entire <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> in 1911. Still, as at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> rank of Monday and Tuesday of Pentecost week is a Double of the First Class.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> it was customary to scatter rose leaves from the ceiling of the churches to recall the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of the fiery tongues; hence in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and elsewhere in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> Whitsunday is called <em>Pascha rosatum</em>. The Italian name <em>Pascha rossa</em> comes from the red colours of the <a href="../cathen/15388a.htm">vestments</a> used on Whitsunday. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> it was customary to blow trumpets during <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Divine service</a>, to recall the sound of the mighty wind which accompanied the Descent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the gentry amused themselves with horse races. The Whitsun Ales or merrymakings are almost wholly obsolete in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. At these ales the Whitsun plays were performed. At <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> of Pentecost in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a> the extraordinary service of <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">genuflexion</a>, accompanied by long poetical <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">psalms</a>, takes place. (Cf. Maltzew, "Fasten-und Blumen Triodion", p. 898 where the entire <a href="../cathen/13253a.htm">Greco-Russian</a> service is given; cf. also Baumstark, "Jacobit. Fest brevier", p. 255.) On Pentecost the <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russians</a> carry flowers and green branches in their hands.
