<h1>Peoria</h1>  

<p>(PEORIENSIS).

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> comprising that part of Central Illinois south of the Counties of Whiteside, Lee, Dekalb, Grundy, Kankakee, and north of the Counties of Adams, Brown, Cass, Menard, Sangamon, Nacon, Moultrie, Douglas, and Edgar. It was cut off from the <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Diocese of Chicago</a> in 1875. Six years later it was enlarged by the addition of Lasalle, Bureau, Henry, Putnam, and Rock Island Counties.

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in this region dates from the days of <a href="../cathen/09690a.htm">Father Marquette</a>, who rested at the Indian village of Peoria on his voyage up the Illinois River in 1673. Opposite the present site of the episcopal city, La Salle and Tonti in 1680 built Fort Cr&egrave;vecoeur, in which <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated and the Gospel preached by the Recollect Fathers, Gabriel Ribourdi, Zenobius <a href="../cathen/10172b.htm">Membr&eacute;</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07215c.htm">Louis Hennepin</a>. With some breaks in the succession, the line of missionaries extends to within a short period of the founding of modern Peoria. In 1839 Father Reho, an Italian, visited Peoria, remaining long enough to build the old stone church in Kickapoo, a small town twelve miles distant. St. Mary's, the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in the city proper, was erected by Father John A. Drew in 1846. Among his successors was the poet, Rev. Abram J. Ryan.

<p>Many of the early <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> immigrants came to work on the Illinois and Michigan canal; owing to the failure of the contracting company, they received their pay in land scrip instead of cash, and were thus forced to settle upon hitherto untilled farm-land. These <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> farmers, with the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> who began to arrive a little later, were the pioneer <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> whose descendants now constitute the strength of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In more recent years Poles, Slavonians, Clovenians, <a href="../cathen/04510a.htm">Croatians</a>, Lithuanians, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> have come in considerable numbers to work in the coal mines. They are organized in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> looked after by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of their own nationality. The first appointee to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, Rev. Michael Hurley, requested to be spared the responsibility of organizing and governing the new diocese. After many years of fruitful labour in Peoria, he died, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> in 1898, and was mourned universally in the city and throughout the diocese.

<p>Rt. Rev. John Lancaster Spalding was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Peoria, 1 May, 1877. Born of the distinguished Spalding <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, in <a href="../cathen/09104a.htm">Lebanon</a>, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, in 1840, and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at Bardstown, Mount St. Mary's, Emmittsburg, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, his career as paster in <a href="../cathen/09386a.htm">Louisville</a>, <a href="../cathen/08620b.htm">Kentucky</a>, as orator, and as author had been marked by signal successes. The promise of his earlier life was more than fulfilled by the long years of his episcopate. Besides creating a new spirit in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, which found expression in new churches, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and institutions of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and charity, he sought fields of larger efforts for his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. He laboured earnestly in the cause of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colonization in the West. He preached the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of life to an ever-increasing and deeply appreciative audience of American people. He ranks high among the educators of the country. The <a href="../cathen/03455a.htm">Catholic University of America</a> owes its origin largely to his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Spalding Institute, Peoria, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys, built and equipped by his generosity, is another monument to his abiding <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. His writings are assured of permanent use and admiration by future generations. At the height of his usefulness he was stricken with paralysis on 6 Jan., 1905, and resigned the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, 11 Sept., 1908, residing in Peoria as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Scitopolis, to which <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> he was raised in 1909.

<p>Right Reverend Edmund M. Dunne, D.D., the second and present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Peoria, was born at <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, 2 Feb., 1864. He began his classical studies at St. Ignatius's College, <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, and finished at the Petit Seminaire at <a href="../cathen/06105b.htm">Floreffe</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. Completing his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 24 June, 1887. Later studies in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> prepared him for the doctor's degree, which was conferred by the Gregorian University in 1890. Eight years of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work in St. Columbkill's church, <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, led to his appointment as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Guardian Angels Parish. His ministrations among the poor <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> were remarkably successful. It was with profound regret that they saw him removed to the chancellorship of the archdiocese, after seven years of unselfish labour. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Peoria, 1 Sept., 1909.
