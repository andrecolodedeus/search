<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pergamus</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a>, suffragan of Ephesus. This city was situated on the banks of the Selinus. It was at first a <a href="../cathen/12712a.htm">city of refuge</a>, as its name indicates, for the people of the plain, and has been regarded as a colony of Arcadians. The Greek historians have reconstructed for it a complete history because they confused it with the distant Teuthrania. It is mentioned for the first time by Xenophon ("Anab.", VII, viii, 8; "Hellen.", III, i, 6). Captured by Xenophon in 399 and immediately recaptured by the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, it was severely punished in 362 after a revolt. It did not become important until Lysimachus, King of Thrace, took possession, 301 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> His lieutenant Philetairos enlarged the town, which in 281 he made the capital of the new kingdom which he founded. In 261 he bequeathed his possessions to his nephew Eumenius I (263-41 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), who increased them greatly, leaving as heir his cousin Attalus I (241-197 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>).

<p>Its highest prosperity was reached under his son Eumenius II (197-59 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>). He founded a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, built in memory of his exploits a magnificent marble altar adorned with a battle of the giants (Ampelius, "Miracula Mundi", 14), the splendid remains of which are in the museum of <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, and finally founded the celebrated <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. Attalus III at his death in 133 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> bequeathed his kingdom to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Aristonicus, natural son of Eumenius II, endeavoured to restore the monarchy, but he was captured in 129 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> by Perpenna, and the kingdom was annexed to the Roman Empire under the name of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> Propria. It is worthy of mention that parchment was discovered there, and that the physician Galen was a native.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01594b.htm">Apocalypse</a> (<a href="../bible/rev002.htm#vrs12">2:12</a>), mentions the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Antipas in connexion with Pergamus. Gaius, to whom was addressed the Third Epistle of St. John, became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of this city, according to the Apostolic Constitutions (vii, 46). Attalus, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> under <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a>, was a native of Pergamus. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea</a> (<a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.15, IV.48</a>), mentions the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> Carpus, Papylus, and Agathonice, executed in March, 250. Out of a population of 120,000 inhabitants which Pergamus then possessed, a large number were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> may be mentioned: Theodotus who about 150 was active against the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of Colorbasiani; <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, present at the Councils of <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a> and Philippopolis in 344; Dracontius, deposed in 360 at the Council of Constantinople; Philip, present at the Council of Ephesus in 431; Eutropius, at the Robber Synod of 449; John, died about 549; Theodore, at the Sixth &OElig;cumenical Council in 681; Basil, at the Seventh in 787; Methodius at the Eighth in 878; George, living in 1256; Arsenius, 1303-16. Pergamus was a suffragan of Ephesus until the twelfth century, when it became a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>. Although long occupied by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> the town was still a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> in 1387, when the title was removed and it became once more a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (Miklosich and M&uuml;ller, "Acta patriarchatus Constantinopolitani", II, 103, 397). The diocese itself soon disappeared.

<p>In 610 the body of Emperor Phocas was burned in a brazen ox brought from Pergamus. In the seventh century an <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> colony, much attached to <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysitism</a>, and from which sprang the Byzantine Emperor Philippicus Bardanes (711-13), established itself there. In 716 the <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arab</a> general Maslama captured the town. From this period dates its decline. It was rebuilt on a smaller scale and formed part of the theme of Thrakesion. Constantine Porphyrogenitus still speaks of it (De themat., I, 24, 5-13) as a brilliant city of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. In 1197 the French of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section2">Second Crusade</a> halted there. The town had already suffered from <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> incursions. It then became the capital of the theme of Neocastra, and a stronghold against the sultans of <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a>. In 1306 the Emir of Karasi captured it from the Greeks, but thirty years later Sultan Orkhan took it from him. Save for the temporary occupation of Timur-Leng in 1402, it has since belonged to the Osmanlis. Under the name of Bergama it now forms a caza of the vilayet of <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a> and numbers 20,000 inhabitants, of whom 10,000 are <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, 700 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and 9,300 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (300 <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> and 9000 <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Greek schismatics</a>). The latter have two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for boys and girls, with about 800 pupils, and five churches. The remains of three ancient churches have been discovered, among them the magnificent basilica of St. John. The <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Sophia was converted into a mosque in 1398.
