<h1>Periodical Literature (Belgium)</h1>  

<h2>Historical outline of the press in Belgium</h2>

<p>Periodical literature in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> may be traced back to 1605 when the Archduke and Archduchess Albert and Isabella granted Abraham Verhoeven of <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a> the privilege of publishing his newspaper "Nieuwe Tijdingen". But it is in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> period of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> history that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literature really originated. At that time appeared the "Spectateur Belge" of Father de Foere, which several times provoked the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of William I; the "Courrier de la Meuse", founded at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> in 1820 by Kersten; the "Catholique des Pays-Bas" and the "Vaderland", both founded at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> by de Neve; the "Politiquede Gand", the "Noord-Brabanter", all showing remarkable <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in defending the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at a time when <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journalists were threatened with <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. A few years after the establishment of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> independence the "Courrier de la Meuse" was transferred from <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> to <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, and took the name of "Journalde Bruxelles". Long afterwards under the editorship of the Baron Prosper de Haulleville (died 1899) it became the leading <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> organ; but now it has lost its prominence.
<h2>Causes which stopped its development</h2>

<p>The Revolution of 1830 brought <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> the liberty of the press. The majority of the population and of the National Congress were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press from 1830 to 1874 improved very slowly. The first cause of this was the disagreement between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>; the next was the neglect of the old and the establishment of new publications. Among the new publications were "Le nouveau conservateur belge", an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and literary magazine, founded in 1830 and discontinued in 1835; the "Messager des sciences historiques et des arts de la Belgique", founded in 1833 and discontinued in 1896; the "Revue Belge" of 1834, which lasted only a few years; the "Revue catholiquede Louvain", devoted to religious controversy, history, and <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a>; from 1843 till 1884 it counted among its contributors the foremost professors of the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>. Another obstacle to the growth of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press is the fact that the people of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> consist of two races with different languages, customs, and habits. Also the competition of French journals injured the growth of the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> press. French periodicals and newspapers appear in <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> almost at the same time as in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Besides their intrinsic merits, they have the advantage of being fashionable. Moreover, many <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> writers have contributed to French periodicals. As an instance we may name the "M&eacute;langes th&eacute;ologiques", a review of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> and canon law founded by a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> in 1847. This magazine removed to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1856, where it was styled "Revue Th&eacute;ologique", and was conducted by a committee of French and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. In 1861 it settled at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and there continued many years.
<h2>Present state</h2>

<p>About the middle of the last century, the religious question became prominent in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> felt the need of a vigorous defence against irreligion and <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasonry</a>. New life was infused into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press and today its condition is more satisfactory.
<h2 id="section1">Dailies</h2>

<p>Out of a total of 86 political daily papers 38 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. In consequence of the constant political activity all the important towns, even the suburbs of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, have their local daily papers. <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> has "La Patrie"; Charleroi, "Le Pays Wallon", a democratic journal of wide and vigorous efficiency; <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, the "Gazette de Li&egrave;ge", which under editorship of Demarteau (1909) has reached a larger circulation than all the other <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> newspapers together. The "Bien Public", founded at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> in 1853 by Senator Lammens, Count de Hemptine, and others, circulates in all the provinces of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, especially among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Its chief editor, Count Verspeyen, who has just celebrated his fiftieth anniversary as a journalist, has secured for it a well-deserved reputation on thoroughly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> lines. The most influential <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journal in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> is the "Patriote", founded in <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> in 1883 by M. Jourdain, which with its local issue the "National" has a circulation of 180,000. His bold and skilful attacks brought about the downfall of the Liberal Government in 1884. The "XX<sup>e</sup> Si&egrave;cle", founded also in <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> by the late Duke d'Ursel, the present <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> Helleputte, de Brocqueville, and others, is more democratic. In <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> also is published "Het Nieuws van den Dag", the most popular newspaper among the Flemings.
<h2 id="section2">Weeklies</h2>

<p>Of the 1200 <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> weeklies, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> certainly control more than one-half. Each important locality has its political and illustrated weeklies. Many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> have their "Bulletin paroissial". Each diocese publishes its "Semaine religieuse". In <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> the organ of the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archbishopric</a>, which is styled "La Vie dioc&eacute;saine", receives contributions from Cardinal Mercier.
<h2 id="section3">Reviews and magazines</h2>

<p>About a thousand reviews and magazines are published in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, many of them by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Theology and religion</h2>

<p>The "Revue th&eacute;ologique" mentioned above was replaced in 1907 by the "Nouvelle revue th&eacute;ologique", edited by Father Besson. Besides this small but useful review, about 150 periodicals of various descriptions treat of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a>, missions, special devotions etc. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> have their "Missions belges de la Compagnie de J&eacute;sus", a well-illustrated monthly magazine, which in 1899 took the place of the old "Pr&eacute;cis historiques", founded by Father Terwecoren. The Fathers of Scheut (near <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>) have their "Missions en Chine, au Congo et aux <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>. Other religious congregations and some large <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> issue reports of their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> works, or reviews of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, of liturgy, <a href="../cathen/07106b.htm">hagiography</a>, etc.
<h2 id="section2">Scientific reviews</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> standard scientific review is the "Revue des questions scientifiques", a large quarterly to which is joined a smaller one of a more technical character. Both were founded in 1877 by <a href="../cathen/03331a.htm">Father Carbonnelle, S.J.</a>, and a Franco-Belgian committee of prominent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scientists. Their motto: <em>Nulla unquam inter fidem et rationem vera dissensio esse potest</em> (Conc. Vatican.) found a practical confirmation in the sound scientific character of the whole series. The present editors are Prof. Mansion and Father Thirion. The "Revue n&eacute;o-scolastique" was founded in 1894 by Cardinal Mercier, while directing his Institut de philosophie thomiste at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, with which it is closely connected (quarterly: present editor, Prof. de Wulf). With the same institution is connected the "Revue catholique de droit", of Prof. Crahay of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, and the "Revue sociale catholique", of Mgr Deploige, Prof. Thiery, Prof. Defourny, and others. At <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> also appear some special scientific reviews, such as the "Revue m&eacute;dicale" and the celebrated magazine of cytology entitled "La Cellule" of the late <a href="../cathen/03370b.htm">Canon Carnoy</a> (present editor, Prof. Gilson). Also some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> reviews: "Le Mus&eacute;on" of the late Mgr de Harlez, continued by Prof. Colinet, Prof. Lefort, and others; "Le Mus&eacute;e belge" of Prof. Collard and Prof. Waltzing (the latter of the <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> University); the "Leucensche Bijdragen" (for <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> philology), edited by Prof. Colinet, Lecoutere, and others. There is also the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> law review, "Revue pratique des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s civiles", founded by Prof. Nyssens, Minister of Labour, and continued by Prof. Corbiau. Outside of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, we notice "Mathesis" (Prof. Mansion of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>); the "Courrier litt&eacute;raire et math&eacute;matique", edited by Prof. H. Gelin and the present writer as a guide for preparing for public examinations.
<h2 id="section3">Historical reviews</h2>

<p>The largest is the important "Revue d'histoire eccl&eacute;siastique", a quarterly founded in 1900 by Canon Cauchie and Canon Ladeuze, now Mgr Ladeuze, Rector of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> University. Others are: the "Revue b&eacute;n&eacute;dictine", which in 1895 took the place of the "Messager des fid&egrave;les", edited since 1884 at the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Maredsous by Dom Gerard van Caloen; the "Archives Belges" (Prof. G. Kurth, at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, since 1899); the "Analectes pour servir &agrave; l'histoire de l'Ordre de Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;", edited at the Park Abbey (Louvain) by Father van Waffelghem. Mention should also be made of the "Analecta Bollandiana" (see <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">BOLLANDISTS</a>).
<h2 id="section4">Literature</h2>

<p>The "Revue G&eacute;n&eacute;rale", though it deals, according to its title, with all matters of common interest, is chiefly a literary review. This monthly publication, founded in 1863, reckoned among its ordinary contributors the distinguished statesmen Malou, <a href="../cathen/04665a.htm">Deschamps</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11123b.htm">Nothomb</a>, Deputy Coomans, Prof. de Monge, the publicist Prosper de Haulleville etc. Today the parliamentary leader, M. Ch. Woeste, makes it the vehicle of his political views. M. Eug. Gilbert regularly contributes to it a most valuable literary chronicle. With this magazine we may mention the "Dietsche Warande en Belfort". Other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> literary reviews are: "Le Magasin Litt&eacute;raire", of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>; "La Lutte" and "Le Journal des gens de lettres belges", of <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, which have pleaded for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> art, but have been succeeded by younger magazines such as "Durandal", a monthly illustrated review edited by Abb&eacute; Moeller, "Le Catholique", and "La Revue Jeune".
<h2 id="section5">Art reviews</h2>

<p>Most of these literary reviews touch upon art questions, but there are also "Revue de l'art chr&eacute;tien", a review of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> arch&aelig;ology; the "Courrier de Saint Gr&eacute;goire" and "Musica sacra" which aims at promoting the use of sound music in Church services; "Le Bulletin de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'art et d'histoire du dioc&egrave;se de Li&egrave;ge", of which Mgr Rutten, now <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, was the president for a long time; the "Bulletin des m&eacute;tiers d'art", which serves as the organ of the St. Luke <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, founded by Brother Mar&egrave;s for teaching the technical arts on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> principles.
