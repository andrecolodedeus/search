<h1>Periodical Literature (Canada)</h1>  

<p>Under the French domination, periodical literature, still in its infancy in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> even as late as the close of the eighteenth century, was totally unknown in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. The first newspapers founded in the colony, the "Quebec Gazette" (1764) and the "Montreal Gazette" (1778), both weeklies with a double-colunm page alternately in English and in French, without being professedly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, were not unfriendly towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h2>Province of Quebec, or lower Canada</h2>

<p>The first periodical of importance was "Le Canadien", founded in Quebec (1806) by Pierre B&eacute;dard. Although essentially political and patriotic, nevertheless by its vindication of religious as well as civil liberty, and owing to the unexceptionable <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> population whose interests it represented, "Le Canadien" may safely be styled a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> organ. This same principle applies to the greater number of French papers published in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. After a series of suppressions and interruptions, "Le Canadien" (first weekly, then daily) lasted for over fifty more years, during a long period of which its chief editor was Etienne Parent, whose valiant pen ably defended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of his fellow-citizens and helped to maintain their national dignity and autonomy.

<p>Next in order of importance, if not of date, follows "La Minerve" (first weekly, then daily), founded in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1826) by Augustin-Norbert Morin. It had a career of seventy years, and numbered among its ablest editors Antoine* G&eacute;rin-Lajoie, Raphael Bellemare, and <a href="../cathen/14463b.htm">Joseph Tass&eacute;</a>. The chief organ of the English-speaking <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was the "True Witness" (weekly), founded in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1850) by George E. Clerk, a convert from <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicanism</a>, who loyally and generously served the cause of the True Faith during his prolonged editorship. The "True Witness" had been preceded by the short-lived "Irish Vindicator" of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1828), and still exists under the lately assumed name of "The Tribune".

<p>In 1857 was founded in Quebec "Le Courrier du Canada" (first weekly, then daily). It had an honourable and fruitful career of forty-five years under the leadership of such learned, vigorous, and elegant writers and uncompromising <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> as Doctor Joseph Charles Tach&eacute;, Auguste-Eug&egrave;ne Aubry, and Thomas Chapais. <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> gave birth to two entirely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> daily papers: "Le Nouveau-Monde" (1867-81) with the Honourable Alphonse Desjardins as chief editor, and "L'Etendard" (1883-) under the direction of the Honourable Senator Anselme Trudel. A weekly, "Les M&eacute;langes Religieux", founded in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1839) by Reverend J. C. Prince, lasted till 1846. "L'Opinion Publique", an illustrated weekly, published in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> for fourteen years (1870-83) counted many brilliant <em>litt&eacute;rateurs</em> among its contributors. Most noteworthy among the monthlies are, in order of date, "Le Journal de l'Instruction Publique", founded in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1857) by the <a href="../cathen/03645c.htm">Honourable Pierre-J.-O. Chauveau</a>, a distinguished orator and writer, who was its chief editor until its cessation (1878); "Les Soir&eacute;es Canadiennes", Quebec (1861-5); "Le Foyer Canadien", Quebec (1863-6); "La Revue Canadienne", <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1864), still flourishing under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> branch of the University of Laval; "Le Canada Fran&ccedil;ais", semi-monthly, edited by the parent University of Quebec (1888-91). These five reviews form a collection replete with the best productions of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">French Canadian</a> literature.

<p>For divers reasons, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press in Lower <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, in fact throughout the whole Dominion, with the exception of a few short-lived ventures cannot boast of a daily newspaper published in the English language. In the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> the only organ of the English-speaking <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> is the above mentioned "Tribune" (weekly). Of the existing French <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> dailies, "L'Action Sociale", founded in Quebec (1907) by Archbishop L.-N. B&eacute;gin, is totally independent of politics, appreciating men and events from an exclusively <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and non-partisan viewpoint; its present circulation, comprising the weekly edition, is 28,000, as compared with the 90,000 of the non-Catholic "Montreal Star". Another, "Le Devoir", advocating nationalism; founded in <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> (1909) and directed by Henri Bourassa, has also a good circulation. The foremost weekly, still in existence, is "La V&eacute;rit&eacute;", founded in Quebec (1881) by Jules-Paul Tardivel, who has been called the <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadian</a> <a href="../cathen/15394b.htm">Veuillot</a>. This paper, during the career of its founder, exerted a considerable influence on <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> opinion. Le Courrier de St-Hyacinthe" (1853), "Le Journal de Waterloo"(1879), "Le Bien Public", Three-Rivers (1909), all weeklies still in operation, deserve a special mention for their soundness of judgment and dutiful submission to the guidance of the spiritual authority. Among the existing monthlies may be mentioned "Le Naturaliste Canadien", Quebec, founded by the <a href="../cathen/12505a.htm">Abb&eacute; L&eacute;on Provancher</a> (1868), the only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scientific review in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>; "La Nouvelle-France", a high-class review with a comprehensive programme; "Le Bulletin du Parlerfran&ccedil;ais", a technical review of a chiefly philological character, both founded in Quebec in 1902; "L'Enseignement Primaire", a pedagogical review, now in its thirty-second year, published in Quebec, and distributed by the Government to all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the province, renders good service to the cause of elementary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. The outlook of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press in the old French province seems very hopeful, thanks to the improvement of higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, to the inculcation of a more thorough <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> spirit, and a more dutiful compliance with the directions of the Vicar of Christ.
<h2>Ontario</h2>

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper published in Upper <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> was the "Catholic", founded and edited in <a href="../cathen/08658a.htm">Kingston</a> (1830) by Very Rev. William Peter MacDonald, and published later in Hamilton (1841-44). In 1837 Toronto had its first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> organ, "The Mirror", which lasted till 1862. It was followed successively by "The Canadian Freeman" (1858-63). under the editorship of J. J. Mallon and James G. Moylan; "The Irish Canadian", established by Patrick Boyle (1863-92; 1900-01); "The Tribune" (1874-85), with the <a href="../cathen/01504a.htm">Hon. Timothy Warren Anglin</a> for its latest editor; "The Catholic Record", <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (1878), is by far the most flourishing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> weekly in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, with its circulation of 27,000. Toronto likewise claims the following noteworthy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> periodical: "The Catholic Weekly Review" (1887-93); its editors were successively F. W. G. Fitzgerald, H. F. McIntosh, P. DeGruchy, Revs. F. W. Flannery and J. D. McBride; in 1893 it was merged into the "Catholic Register", whose editors were, in order of date, Rev. Doctor J. R. Teefy, J. C. Walsh, and P. P. Cronin. In 1908, under the title of "Register-Extension", it became the organ of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Extension Society, under the editorship of Rev. A. E. Burke, D.D.
<h2>Maritime provinces</h2>
<h3>Nova Scotia</h3>

<p>Though Halifax can boast of the first newspaper in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, now including the Maritime Provinces (the "Royal Gazette", 1752), the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> periodical, "The Cross", was founded only in 1845, by the future Archbishop W. Walsh, and lasted till 1857. By far the most important <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> organ of the province is "The Casket" (weekly), of <a href="../cathen/01562c.htm">Antigonish</a>, founded in 1852 and still in full activity. Its editorial chair was successively filled by the learned <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, Doctors M. McGregor, N. McNeil, and Alex. McDonald, the two last named since appointed respectively to the Sees of <a href="../cathen/15267b.htm">Vancouver</a> and Victoria, <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a>. Sureness of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and vigilance in denouncing contemporary <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> are its chief characteristics.
<h3>New Brunswick</h3>

<p>"The Freeman", a political paper, was founded in St. John, 1851, with <a href="../cathen/01504a.htm">Hon. T. W. Anglin</a> as editor. He was succeeded by W. R. Reynolds. Under the name of "The New Freeman" since 1902, its character is exclusively <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. While strongly advocating temperance and total abstinence, it strives to enlighten non-Catholics and to foster vocations for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. French Acadian journalism is chiefly represented by "Le Moniteur Acadien", founded at Shediac (1866), and "L'Evangeline", of Moncton.
<h3>Prince Edward Island</h3>

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper of the island was the "Palladium" (1843-5). It was followed by the "Examiner" (1847-67), both edited by Edward Whelan. Then came "The Vindicator" (1862-4), strictly non-political, to be succeeded by "The Charlottetown Herald", still in existence.
<h2>Northwest provinces</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journalism in the north-west begins in 1871 with "Le M&eacute;tis", the organ of the half-breeds, under the editorship of Hon. J. Royal. Next comes "Le Manitoba", a valiant champion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, founded by Hon. J. Bernier, and now edited by his son. The first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper in English was "The North-West Review", begun in 1885, long edited by Rev. L. Drummond, S.J., and still fighting the good fight. The German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have also their organ, "West Canada", and the Poles their "Gazeta Katolicka". These three papers are issued by the same printing-house in Winnipeg, under the patronage of the present <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of St. Boniface (1911). A <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper will shortly appear under the same auspices. "Le Patriote" began publication in 1910, at Duck Lake, Sask. Edmonton, Alta, has "Le Courrier de l'Ouest", and Vancouver, <a href="../cathen/02791b.htm">British Columbia</a>, "The Western <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>".
