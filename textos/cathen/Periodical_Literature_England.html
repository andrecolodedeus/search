<h1>Periodical Literature (England)</h1>  

<p>Not until the toleration acts of the early nineteenth century and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> revival incident upon the immigration of the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, were <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in any position to conduct a periodical literature of their own, though occasional pamphlets on various questions of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interest had been issued. With the agitation over the Veto and Emancipation, a beginning was made with a monthly review, the pioneer <a href="../cathen/11669b.htm">Catholic publication</a> of the kind, "Andrews' Orthodox Journal", first issued in 1812 by <a href="../cathen/01475a.htm">Eusebius Andrews</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> printer and bookseller of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. It had but a few years of chequered existence, as there was not a sufficiently large reading public to make it self-supporting. The real beginnings of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> periodical literature were made more than twenty years later, by which time the growth of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body in its newly won freedom, the progress of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and the interest excited by the Tractarian movement had all combined to supply a wider circle of readers. A great step was taken by <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a> and O'Connell in the foundation of a quarterly, the "Dublin Review" (1836). The fame of the "Edinburgh" suggested a territorial title, and Dublin was chosen as a great <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> centre, though from the first it was edited and published in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. The review was intended to provide a record of current thought for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and at the same time to be an exponent of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> views to non-Catholic inquirers. Beginning before the first stirrings of the <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a>, it presents a record of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> life of the century and produced articles which had an immense influence upon the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> thought of the times. It was in the August of 1839 that an article by <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a> on the Anglican Claim caught the attention of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>. Impressed by the application of the words of St. Augustine, <em>securus judicat orbis terrarum,</em> which interpreted and summed up the course of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a>, he saw the theory of the <em>Via media</em> "absolutely pulverized" (Apologia, 116-7). It was a turning point for <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> and for the whole course of the <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a>, and the incident is worth remembering as an example of the power of a good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press. Gradually the Tractarian converts appeared in the lists of contributors: <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Ward</a>, <a href="../cathen/11173a.htm">Oakeley</a>, Marshall, Morris, Christie, <a href="../cathen/06139a.htm">Formby</a>, Capes, <a href="../cathen/01323b.htm">Allies</a>, Anderson (q.v.), <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a>, and a glance through the volumes of the "Dublin' will reveal names prominent in the great religious, scientific, and literary movements of the century. During the sixties and the early seventies it was under the vigorous direction of <a href="../cathen/15552c.htm">Dr. W.G. Ward</a>. After his retirement it was edited by Dr. Hedley, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Newport, and then acquired by <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a>, who appointed Canon Moyes editor. It is now the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and under the direction of Mr. Wilfrid Ward, son of its famous editor.

<p>The first issue of the annual "Catholic Directory" appeared in 1837. Owing to the <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a>, the forties were a time of marked literary activity. In 1840 two new enterprises were inaugurated. <a href="../cathen/05099a.htm">Mr. Dolman</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> publisher in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> who had issued a number of really important books including the writings of <a href="../cathen/09270c.htm">Lingard</a> and <a href="../cathen/07589a.htm">Husenbeth</a>, produced in "Dolman's Magazine" a high class literary monthly, and on 16 May, 1840, Frederick Lucas became the pioneer of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspaper Press in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by publishing the first number of "The Tablet", a weekly newspaper and review. Lucas was a strong man, and regarded his work as founder and editor of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper as a sacred mission. He threw into it all his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and energy, realizing the enormous possibilities for good of the religious Press when many were hopelessly blind to such considerations. His uncompromising views led to difficulties with his financial supporters, but he emerged triumphant. For awhile after the crisis of 1848 Lucas, then active in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> politics, removed "The Tablet" office to <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, but it was brought back to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> by the new proprietors, into whose hands it passed when failing health compelled Lucas to give up the editorship. It was not easy to replace such a man. He had not been content to chronicle events; he had influenced them. For many years after his death, in 1855, "The Tablet" was a mere humdrum record of news. Among the distinguished editors was <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a> who conducted the "Tablet" during the stormy discussions on <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">Papal Infallibility</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. When he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13399a.htm">Salford</a>, he placed the editorship in the hands of Mr. Elliot Ranken, who was succeeded by Mr. Snead-Cox, the present editor. "The Tablet", besides championing the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause, assists in the propagation of the Faith in far-off lands, as under the terms of the trust created by the late <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a> its profits go to the support of St. Joseph's Missionary College, of which he was the founder.

<p>Two other notable periodicals were founded in the forties. "The Tablet" was a sixpenny paper, reduced to its present price, five pence, on the abolition of the newspaper stamp <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. Its price put it beyond the reach of tens of thousands of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> workers. To supply them with a penny magazine Mr. Bradley in 1846 founded "The Lamp". It gave much of its space to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> fiction, descriptive articles, and the like, and ventured on an occasional illustration, a portrait or a picture of a new church; but it also supplied news and reported in full <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman's</a> lectures and other notable <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> utterances. For years it struggled with lack of capital, and for awhile Bradley edited his paper from his room in the debtors' <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> at York. His name deserves honourable record as the pioneer of the popular <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press. The other paper, "The Rambler", of which the first issue appeared on 1 January, 1848, was intended to be a high class weekly review of literature, art, and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. In 1859, Lord Acton, who had then just returned from the Continent, succeeded <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> in the editorship. The price, sixpence, limited its public and in 1862 it became a quarterly under the title of "The Home and Foreign Review". In its last years this review, which had once done good service, was a source of trouble and disedification, but its sale, which dwindled yearly, was largely among <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> and other non-Catholics. In the mid years of the nineteenth century the abolition of the various taxes on newspapers and the cheapening of the processes of production led to the coming of the penny newspapers. The first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> penny paper with permanent success was "The <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Universe". Its origin was connected with the earlier activity of Lucas, who successfully advocated the introduction of the Conferences of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. It was a group of members of the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Conferences who produced "The Universe". Speaking to their president, Mr. George Blount, one evening in 1860, <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a>, after alluding to the flood of <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> then poured out in the Press against the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, said: "Cannot the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">Society of St. Vincent de Paul</a> do something to answer those frightful <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>, by publishing <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, as M. <a href="../cathen/15394b.htm">Louis Veuillot</a> is doing in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 'L'Univers'? We want a penny paper, and now that the tax has been removed it should be possible." It was decided that, though the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, as such, could not found a newspaper, a committee of its members should undertake the task. It included George Blount, Stuart Knill (afterwards the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Lord Mayor of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>), Viscount Fielding (Lord Denbigh), Viscount Campden (Lord Gainsborough), Sidney Lescher, Archibald Dunn, Arthur &agrave; Beckett, and <a href="../cathen/15620a.htm">George J. Wigley</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> correspondent of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> "Univers". <a href="../cathen/15620a.htm">Wigley</a> secured a foreign news service for the projected paper from <a href="../cathen/15394b.htm">M. Veuillot's</a> <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> office, and at his suggestion the name of "The Universe" was chosen. Mr. Denis Lane undertook the printing, Mr. Dunn the editorship, and on 8 December, 1860, the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> penny paper in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was started. At first it was strictly non-political. The editor and staff gave their services gratuitously, but even with this help expenses were greater than receipts. To attract a larger circulation political articles were inserted, which led to the resignation of the greater part of the staff. Mr. Lane then took over the paper and conducted it for many years as a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper, giving a general support to the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> national cause. He had always a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> as "theological editor"; amongst those who thus assisted him were Father W. Eyre, S.J., Father Lockhart, and <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Cardinal Manning</a>. The movement for the rescue of destitute <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children originated in "The Universe" office. It has lately celebrated its fiftieth anniversary, and has amalgamated with another paper, "The Catholic Weekly", founded to give a record of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> news without any party politics. "The Universe" has thus reverted to its original programme.

<p>"The Lamp" was reorganized about the same time and had for some years a prosperous existence as a popular magazine. Fathers <a href="../cathen/12669a.htm">Rawes</a> and <a href="../cathen/03417a.htm">Caswall</a>, <a href="../cathen/06318a.htm">Lady Georgiana Fullerton</a>, <a href="../cathen/05153b.htm">Miss Drane</a>, Cecilia Caddell were among its contributors. In 1864 Miss Taylor founded "The Month", at first an illustrated magazine giving much of its space to fiction and the lighter forms of literature. When she founded her first community of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> (<a href="../cathen/12258a.htm">Poor Servants of the Mother of God</a>), her magazine passed to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and under the able editorship of the late Father Henry J. Coleridge, "The Month" became a high-class review. It had many notable contributors, and in its pages <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman's</a> "Dream of Gerontius" first appeared. Numerically, the main strength of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> has always been in the North, and after the foundation of "The Universe" several efforts were made to produce a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> penny paper in Lancashire. Three successive enterprises had a brief career. A fourth, a paper known as "The Northern Press" was barely existing, when, in 1867, it was taken over by a remarkable man, the late Father James Nugent of <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>. He renamed it "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Times" and gradually made it the most widely circulated <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Printed for many years by the boys of the refuge he had founded in <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, when it became a profit-earning paper it helped support this work of charity. Offices were opened in <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a> and <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. A special <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> edition was produced, and in 1878 a <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> supplement issued under the title of "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Fireside" was so successful that it was continued as a monthly penny magazine; in 1893 it was made a weekly publication. "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Times" appeals largely to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> descent in Great Britain, and has always championed the Nationalist cause. It gives considerable space to reviews and literary matter, and has a well organized service of correspondents. Mr. P.L. Beazley, the present editor, has directed it for twenty-seven years and is now the dean of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journalism.

<p>In the sixties other papers were founded, for awhile fairly prosperous, though they never won the established position of "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Times" and "The Tablet". "The Weekly Register" was a threepenny paper, of much the same character as "The Tablet", but favouring the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> and Nationalists. Later, under the editorship of Charles Kent and then of Mr. Wilfrid Meynell, it had a marked literary quality, but in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> it is found that no paper is a permanent success at any price between the popular penny and the sixpence that gives a margin of profit on a moderate circulation. "The Weekly Register" has ceased to exist and with it "The Westminster Gazette", whose name is now that of a <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> evening paper. The "Westminster" was owned and edited by Pursell, afterwards biographer of <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a>. During the months of newspaper controversy that preceded the definition of <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">Papal Infallibility</a> the "Westminster" was "non-opportunist", and <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a>, while he avoided all controversy on the subject in "The Tablet", contributed, week after week, letters to the "Westminster", combating its editorial views. It never had much circulation, and <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Vaughan</a> was able a few years later to end its competition by buying and stopping it. The late Father Lockhart edited for some years "Catholic Opinion" a penny paper giving extracts from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> press at home and abroad. After his death it was amalgamated with "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Times". A remarkable development in connexion with the popular Press is that directed by Mr. Charles Diamond, for some time a member of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Parliamentary party, who started (1884) "The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Tribune" in Newcastle-on-Tyne. Shortly after, he purchased two other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> papers, the Glasgow "Observer" and the Preston "Catholic News", which were in difficulties for want of capital. He then formed the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of working several papers from a common centre, much of the matter being common to all, but each appearing under a local title and having several columns of special matter of local interest. He now issues "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Herald" from <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, as the centre of the organization, and thirty-two other local weekly papers in various towns of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. He also produces on the same system ten different <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> magazines and "The Catholic Home Journal", with which the old "Lamp" has been amalgamated.

<p>There are a considerable number of minor <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> monthlies, mostly founded in recent years to advocate and promote special objects. The "Annals of the Propagation of the Faith" and "illustrated <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Missions" specialize on the news of the mission field. "Catholic Book Notes", a monthly issued by the <a href="../cathen/15077a.htm">Catholic Truth Society</a> and edited by Mr. James Britten, is an admirable record of current literature and a model of scholarly and thoroughly honest reviewing. "The Second Spring", edited by Father Philip Fletcher, is a record of the work of the Ransom League for the conversion of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. "The Crucible" is a monthly review of social work for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. There are a number of devotional magazines issued by various <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, the most widely circulated of which is the "Messenger of the Sacred Heart", edited by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. There are also several college magazines, some of which produce work of a high literary standard. It might be a gain if there were more concentration and fewer publications with larger circulation. Many of these have a comparatively small circle of readers; even the most widely circulated <a href="../cathen/11669b.htm">Catholic publication</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> has an issue that falls far below that of its more powerful non-Catholic competitors. The result is that the scale of pay in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journalism is below the ordinary press standards, and many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers in working for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press are making a continual sacrifice; but the standard of work produced has steadily risen, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> today, with all its deficiencies and difficulties, is doing most useful work and exercises an ever growing influence.
