<h1>Periodical Literature (Portugal)</h1>  

<p>An ephemeral news-sheet appeared in 1625, and a monthly gazette relating the progress of the War of Independence commenced in 1641, but Portuguese periodical literature really begins with the "Gazetade Lisboa", founded by Jos&eacute; Freire de Monterroyo Mascarenhas, which lasted from 1715 until 1760. Until the end of the eighteenth century any differences of opinion in matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which might exist were not discussed in print, but, notwithstanding the censorship, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> began to filter into <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and early in the nineteenth century the press began to be divided between Liberal and Absolutist; the former advocating radical changes in State and Church, the latter defending Absolutism in politics, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. In 1798 appeared the "Mercurio" to combat the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, and this was followed by other anti-French journals, among them the "Observador Portuguez". On the Liberal side came the "Investigador Portuguez" in 1811 and the "Portuguez" in 1814, both published in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, from which city the Liberal exiles directed their assaults on the old regime. These attacks were met by the "Expectador Portuguez". The Revolution of 1820 gave a great stimulus to journalism, and the "Diario do Governo" began to be issued in that year. At first the Liberal papers were rather anti-Absolutist than anti-Catholic, but the Civil War led to the formation of two political camps, and <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> in politics came to mean <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> in religion. The activity of <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasonry</a> and the unprogressive <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the Absolutists were the causes. As early as 1823 the "Archivo da Religi&atilde;o Christ&atilde;" was founded "to combat error and impiety", but the papers of this period were devoted almost entirely to politics, all being very violent. Among those which argued for a constitution, the "Portuguez", directed by Garrett, showed the greatest literary skill. The year 1827 saw the issue of an avowedly anti-clerical print, while the defence of Throne and Altar was carried on by the redoubtable Father Jos&eacute; Agostinho de Macedo in the "Besta Esfolada" (Flayed Beast) and many other periodicals of a most bellicose character. From 1829 to 1833 the "Defensor dos Jesuitas" was issued to <a href="../cathen/14103a.htm">defend the Society</a>, which fell with the other orders when the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> triumphed and Dom Miguel lost his throne.

<p>The constitutional monarchy had an anti-clerical character from the first, and most of the papers took on the same tone. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press became an absolute necessity, but as its supporters were mostly Miguelists, it was too political, and never exercised much religious influence over the nation. "The Peninsula", organ of the Miguelist exiles, supported the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Absolutist cause until 1872, and the "Na&ccedil;&atilde;o", of the same party, still exists. From 1840 to 1892 the chief Radical paper was the "Revolu&ccedil;&atilde;o de Septembro". The purely religious organs included the "Annaes da Propaga&ccedil;&atilde;o da F&eacute;" (1838); the "Cruz", an Oporto weekly; and the "Atalaia Catholica", printed at <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a>; but the other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> papers had a short life, though the "Bem Publico" (Public Weal) lasted from 1859 to 1877. In 1863 came the "Boletim do Clero e do Professorado", a pedagogic paper, in 1866 the "Uni&atilde;o Catholica", a religious and literary weekly, and in 1871 the "F&eacute;". The "Palavra" of <a href="../cathen/11260a.htm">Oporto</a> was founded in 1872, and in 1874 the "Mensageiro do Cora&ccedil;&atilde;o de Jesus", the monthly organ of the <a href="../cathen/01633a.htm">Apostleship of Prayer</a>, which in 1881 slightly changed its title. In 1883 was founded the "Institui&ccedil;&otilde;es Christ&atilde;s", a fortnightly religious and scientific review, which, however, ceased in 1893; in 1885 the "Clero Portuguez", a weekly <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> review; and in 1889 the "Voz do Evangelho", a monthly. While the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> papers lacked support, the secular press was expanding rapidly, and developed a more and more irreligious, or at least indifferentist, character. This is even more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the Republican papers. It would take too much space even to name the principal secular newspapers, but it is enough to say that they favoured the subjection of Church to State and defended the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of Aguiar ("Kill-friars") which suppressed the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. This attitude has become more marked since the Revolution, nearly all the Monarchical papers having ceased publication, or passed over to the Republicans, who are mostly anti-Catholic.

<p>The present <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press consists of the following papers: <ul><li><strong><em>Dailies</em></strong>. &#151; The "Palavra", with a circulation of 12,000 and the "Correio do Norte", with 6,000, both at <a href="../cathen/11260a.htm">Oporto</a>. The "Portugal" of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> had a circulation of 11,500, but ceased when the Republic was proclaimed. The circulation of the irreligious "Seculo" and "Mundo" is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> greater than that of the three <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> dailies combined. <li><strong><em>Weeklies</em></strong>. &#151; The publishing house, "Veritas", at <a href="../cathen/07049a.htm">Guarda</a>, prints a paper which appears under distinct titles in various provincial towns. <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> has the "Bem Publico", Guimar&atilde;es the "Restaura&ccedil;&atilde;o", Oporto the "Ensino", and Vizeu the "Revista Catholica". <li><strong><em>Monthlies</em></strong>. &#151; The "Novo Mensageiro do Cora&ccedil;&atilde;o de Jesus", published by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, ceased when the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> was expelled in October, 1910; the "Voz de Santos Antonio", a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> print, had already been suspended by order of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for its <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernism</a>, and the only existing review of importance is the "Rosario", issued by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>.</ul>

<p>If the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press limits itself in future to religious and social action, and lays aside the old methods in which it identified religion with the monarchy, it may regain some influence over those who have not altogether lost <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sentiments. For some years before the Revolution it was too political and fought the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with their own arms.
