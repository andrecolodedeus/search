<h1>Periodical Literature (The United States)</h1>  

<p>According to "The Official <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Directory" for 1911, there are 321 <a href="../cathen/11669b.htm">Catholic periodicals</a> published in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Of these about two-thirds, or 201, are printed in English, 51 in German, 24 in French, 24 in Polish, 7 in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a>, 5 in Italian, 2 in Slavonic, 2 in Magyar, 2 in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, 1 in Croatian, 1 in <a href="../cathen/14192a.htm">Spanish</a> 1 in an Indian dialect. These make up 13 dailies, 115 weeklies, 128 monthlies, 29 quarterlies, 2 bi-weeklies, 5 semi-weeklies, 4 semi-monthlies, 9 bi-monthlies, and 16 annuals. Of the dailies 7 are French, 4 Polish, 2 German, and 1 <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a>; none is English. The <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canadians</a> of Maine, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, and Rhode Island support seven dailies, eleven weeklies, one semi-weekly, one monthly, and a quarterly, all of which are printed in French. From 1809 to 1911 some 550 <a href="../cathen/11669b.htm">Catholic periodicals</a> were started in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> but only five of those published during the first half of the nineteenth century survive. Several attempts have been made to establish a news association of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> papers, notably at <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, in May, 1890, but nothing practical came of these efforts.

<p>According to localities the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> publications are divided up as follows: Alabama, 2; Arizona, 1; Arkansas, 1; <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, 9; <a href="../cathen/04129a.htm">Colorado</a>, 2; Connecticut, 5; Delaware, 4; <a href="../cathen/15558a.htm">District of Columbia</a>, 7; Illinois, 30; <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, 14; <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, 8; Kansas, 4; Kentucky, 5; Louisiana, 2; Maine, 2; <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, 10; <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, 15; Michigan, 11; Minnesota, 7; Missouri, 15; <a href="../cathen/10516b.htm">Montana</a>, 1; Nebraska, 2; <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>, 1; New Jersey, 4; <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>, 1; New York, 61; North Carolina, 2; <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, 23; <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, 7; <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, 29; Rhode Island, 1; South Carolina, 2; <a href="../cathen/14508a.htm">Tennessee</a>, 2; <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>, 6; <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a>, 1; Washington, 2; <a href="../cathen/15605a.htm">West Virginia</a>, 1; <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, 21.

<p>Many publications advocating <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> interests are, and have been, edited by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and addressed to a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> constituency, but they are secular political enterprises, and are not to be properly enumerated under the head of religious publications (see THE IRISH, IN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN IRELAND: <em>United States</em>).
<h2>Newspapers</h2>

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspaper printed in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was due to the enterprise of Father Gabriel Richard, of <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, Michigan. In 1808 he visited Baltimore, and while there bought a printing press and a font of type which he sent over the mountains to Detroit (then a frontier town) and set up in the house of one Jacques Lasselle, in the suburb of Springwells. On this press, the lever of which is still preserved in the museum of the Michigan Historical Society, he printed, on 31 August, 1809, the first issue of "The Michigan Essay, or Impartial Observer", containing sixteen columns and a half in English, and one column and a half in French, on miscellaneous topics. There is no Local news included in its contents and only one advertisement, that of St. Anne's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, Detroit. The imprint says the paper was printed and published by James M. Miller, but under the direction of Father Richard. It was to appear every Thursday; only one issue, however, was made, and of this but five copies are extant. The next journalistic effort was in New York, where Thomas O'Connor, father of the jurist Charles O'Conor, began, 10 December, 1810, a weekly called the "Shamrock, or Hibernian Chronicle", which ceased publication 17 August, 1817. It was revived as a monthly called "The Globe" in 1819 and lasted a year. His pen, says his son, "was ever directed in vindicating the fame of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of our United American States, or the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and purity of his cherished mother the Apostolic Church". Although these two papers were not distinctively religious journals, they were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in tone and teaching, as might be expected from their <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> direction.

<p><a href="../cathen/05470a.htm">Bishop England of Charleston</a> follows, in 1822, with his "United States <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Miscellany". "The writer would add", says the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, in a history of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> which he published while on a visit to <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, in 1832, "that during upwards of ten years he and his associates have, at a very serious pecuniary loss, not to mention immense labour, published a weekly paper, 'The <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Miscellany', in which the cause of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> at home and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irishmen</a> abroad, and of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion through the world, has been defended to the best of their ability. This paper is published every week on a large sheet of eight pages containing twenty-four pages of letter press, in the city of <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>." Its publication ceased in 1861, as a result of the War of Secession. One of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> most efficient assistants in this enterprise was his sister Johanna, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of fine culture and much <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> vigour, who has never received proper credit for all the variety of solid work she did on the paper. With the second quarter of the nineteenth century came the great influx of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> immigrants and a consequent development of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press. The pioneer journal of this era was "The Truth Teller", the first number of which appeared in New York, on 2 April, 1825, with the imprint of W.K. Andrews &amp; Co., which was continued on the first six issues of the paper. <a href="../cathen/01475a.htm">William Eusebius Andrews</a> was the English publisher who was so active in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, during <a href="../cathen/10315a.htm">Bishop Milner's</a> time, and his connexion with the New York venture is now explainable only as he was then printing a "Truth Teller" in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. In. the issue of 19 October, 1825, <a href="../cathen/04722b.htm">William Denman</a> and George Pardow are given as the proprietors of the New York "Truth Teller", and so continued until 2 January, 1830, when Pardow sold his interest to <a href="../cathen/04722b.htm">Denman</a>, and the latter remained its sole proprietor until 31 March, 1855, when he disposed of it to the owners of the "Irish American", who shortly after merged it in that paper.



<p>Denman, in the early days of the "Truth Teller", had the assistance, as contributors, of the Rev. Dr. John Power, <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of St. Peter's Church, the Rev. Thomas Levins, a former <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> and a man of ripe learning and ability, Dr. William James MacNeven q.v.), the Rev. Joseph A. Schneller, the Rev. Felix Varela, and Thomas O'Connor, but the paper becoming tainted with trusteeism (see <a href="../cathen/15071b.htm">TRUSTEE SYSTEM</a>), and opposing Bishop Dubois, a rival, the "Weekly Register and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Diary" was started on 5 October, 1833, by Fathers Schneller and Levins. It lasted three years, and was succeeded, in 1839, by the "Catholic Register", which, the next year, was combined with the "Freeman's Journal", then a year old. The editors at that were James W. and John E. White, nephews of <a href="../cathen/07032a.htm">Gerald Griffin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> novelist. <a href="../cathen/03403d.htm">Eugene Casserly</a> and John T. Devereux succeeded them, and in 1842 Bishop Hughes took the paper to keep it alive, and made his secretary the Rev. James Roosevelt Bayley (afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>), its editor. In 1848 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> offered to give the paper to <a href="../cathen/03001a.htm">Orestes A. Brownson</a>, but soon after sold it to <a href="../cathen/09506a.htm">James A. McMaster</a>, the latter borrowing the money for its purchase from George Hecker, a brother of the <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Rev. Isaac T. Hecker</a>, founder of the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulists</a>. <a href="../cathen/09506a.htm">McMaster</a> continued as its editor and proprietor until his death, 29 Dec., 1886. In 1801, because of its violent State's Rights editorials, it was suppressed by the Government, and did not resume publication until 19 April, 1862. Maurice Francis Egan was editor of the paper for two years after <a href="../cathen/09506a.htm">McMaster's</a> death, and in 1894 the Rev. Dr. Louis A. Lambert (born at Allenport, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, 11 February, 1835; died at <a href="../cathen/10782a.htm">Newfoundland</a>, <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>, 25 September, 1910) took the position and so continued until his death.

<p>New York City was during the first half of the nineteenth century, the leader in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journalism. The pioneer papers devoted their space mainly to controversial articles explanatory of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of the Faith, and in defence of the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in answer to attack and <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>. The assaults of the Native American and <a href="../cathen/08677a.htm">Know-nothing</a> periods also largely engaged their attention. In this they were assisted by a number of journals not strictly religious, but political and social, edited by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and for a numerous constituency <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> by birth or descent. Of these the oldest, "The Irish American", founded 12 August 1849, by Patrick Lynch (born. at Kilkenny, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1811; died in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, New York, May, 1857); edited from 1857 until 1906 by his step-son Patrick J. Meehan (born at <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 17 July, 1831; died Jersey City, <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>, 20 April, 1906), with the "Catholic Telegraph" of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> (founded 1831) "Pilot" of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> (1837), "Freeman's Journal" of New York (1840), and "Catholic" of <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a> (1846), alone survive in 1911, of the many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> papers in existence in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> during the first half of the nineteenth century. In October, 1848, <a href="../cathen/09492c.htm">Thomas D'Arcy McGee</a> began in New York a paper called "The Nation" which lasted until June, 1850, its end being hastened by <a href="../cathen/09492c.htm">McGee's</a> violent controversy with Bishop Hughes. Another venture of his, "The American Celt", completed in June, 1857, had a peripatetic existence of four years &mdash; in <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, <a href="../cathen/03037a.htm">Buffalo</a>, and New York &mdash; when it was purchased by D. &amp; J. Sadlier and made over into a new paper, "The Tablet", the first number of which appeared on 5 June of that year, with Bernard Doran Kilian as it editor. His successors in that position, until the paper died in 1893, included <a href="../cathen/07564a.htm">Dr. J.V. Huntington</a>, <a href="../cathen/04722b.htm">William Denman</a>, <a href="../cathen/13323c.htm">Mrs. M. A. Sadlier</a>, Dr Henry J. Anderson, <a href="../cathen/03001a.htm">O.A. Brownson</a>, Lawrence Kehoe, and D. P. Conyngham. Archbishop Hughes started, in 1859, as his personal organ, "The Metropolitan Record", which ceased publication in 1873. During all this time John Mullaly was its editor.

<p>In 1872 "The Catholic Review", a paper combining the ideals of progressive modern journalism under the direction of a man who had had practical newspaper training, was begun by Patrick V. Hickey (born in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 14 Feb., 1846; died in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, New York, 21 Feb., 1889). For a time it met with success as a high-class weekly, and, to meet the demand for a cheap popular paper, Hickey printed also, in 1888, "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> American" and the "Illustrated Catholic American". After his death, the Rev. J. Talbot Smith edited "The Review", which ceased to exist in 1899. Mr. Herman Ridder founded "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> News" in 1886 and it is notable that the historian Dr. John Gilmary Shea closed his long and splendid career as its editor, 22 Feb., 1892. The "News" attained a very large and widespread circulation as a medium of entertaining and instructive reading matter for the masses under the business management of Henry Ridder and the editorial direction of Michael J. Madigan.

<p>Several attempts have been made to establish a paper in the <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Diocese of Brooklyn</a>, notably the "Catholic Examiner", in 1882, and the "Leader", in 1884. Both were shortlived. In June, 1908, the "Tablet" was started. In February, 1909, it was made a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> organ and purchased by a company made up of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Albany had a "Catholic Pioneer" in 1863, followed by several other ventures with brief existences. The "Catholic Sun" of <a href="../cathen/14397a.htm">Syracuse</a> in 1892, succeeded the "Catholic Reflector" of the early sixties and the equally shortlived "Vindicator" and "Sentinnel". The "Sun" is also circulated as the "Catholic Chronicle" in <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a> and the "Catholic Light" in <a href="../cathen/13633a.htm">Scranton</a>, Pennyslvania. The Newark, <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>, "Monitor" was begun in September, 1906. Buffalo, New York, also had several experiences, beginning with <a href="../cathen/09492c.htm">D'Arcy McGee's</a> "American Celt", in 1852, and culminating in the "Catholic Union and Times", the "Union" starting in 1872, and being combined later with the "Times", founded in 1877 by the Rev. Louis A. Lambert, at Waterloo. For most of the years of its progress the editor was the Rev. Patrick Cronin (born in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1836; died at North Tonawanda, New York, 12 Dec., 1905), a forceful and able writer and a recognized leader among the <a href="../cathen/08132b.htm">Irish-American</a> element in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> papers of Philadelphia start with the Hogan <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> (see <a href="../cathen/04349a.htm">HENRY CONWELL</a>), the "Catholic Herald and Weekly Register" being issued 30 Nov., 1822, by E. F. Crozet to support the rebellious <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. To offset its influence and assist Bishop Conwell, the "Catholic Advocate and Irishman's Journal" was started 22 Feb., 1823. In August, 1822, the "Erin", a national paper, was first issued. These were followed in 1833 by the "Catholic Herald", which had a stormy existence under the editorial management of a convert, Henry Major, who was a professor in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. Disappointed in his <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, Major relapsed to Episcopalianism, though he repented in his last illness. He was a bitter antagonist of <a href="../cathen/03001a.htm">Orestes A. Brownson</a> in the controversies that were carried on during the fifties by the editors of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> publications of that period. Another "Catholic Herald" was issued 22 June, 1872, by Marc F. Vallette, and had a brief existence. The "Catholic Standard", started 6 June, 1866, was suspended 20 Feb., 1867, but resumed publication on 22 June of the same year. Its first editor was the Rev. Dr. James Keogh; others were Mark Wilcox, George D. Wolf, and F. T. Furey. In 1874 Hardy &amp; Mahony became its publishers, and 7 Dec., 1895, it combined (under the title of "Catholic Standard and Times") with the "Catholic Times", a rival which had the Rev. Louis A. Lambert as editor, and the first number of which was <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 3 Dec., 1892. Its news, editorials, and correspondence are regarded as authoritative, and frequently quoted by the secular Press. A monthly, the "Irish Catholic Benevolent Union Journal", with <a href="../cathen/16042b.htm">Martin I.J. Griffin</a> as editor, began in March, 1873; had its title changed in March, 1894, to "Griffin's Journal", and suspended in July, 1900.

<p>Bishop Michael O'Connor, of <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, founded (16 March, 1844) "The Pittsburg <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>". Its manager and proprietor was J. F. Boylan, with whom was associated a printer named Jacob Porter, a convert. On 30 June, 1847, Porter and Henry McNaughton bought the paper with which Porter retained his connexion until 1889. He died in his eighty-third year, 14 January, 1908. An early editor was the Rev. Hugh P. Gallagher, president of the Pittsburg <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, born in County Donegal, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in 1815, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1840. In 1852 he went to <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, where he started the "Catholic Standard" the following year. He died there in 1883. The "Catholic Observer" of <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a> dates from 1899. The "Emerald Vindicator" began at <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, May, 1882, moved to Norfolk, <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>, in August, 1888, suspended in July, 1889. During the seventies, under Bishop Mullen's patronage the "Lake Shore Visitor" was published at <a href="../cathen/05518b.htm">Erie</a>, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, for several years.

<p>Bishop Fenwick, feeling that a journalistic organ was needed in <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, started "The Jesuit, or Catholic Sentinel", the first number of which was <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 5 September, 1829. "The rapid increase and respectability of Roman Catholics in Boston and throughout the New England States", says the prospectus, "loudly calls for the publication of a Newspaper, in which the Doctrine of the Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, ever the same, from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> Age down to our time, may be truly explained, and moderately, but firmly defended." Objection having been made that the name "The Jesuit" was prejudicial to the increase of circulation. Bishop Fenwick, after four months, allowed the title to be changed to "The Catholic Intelligencer", but in a short time went back to the original style. This did not improve conditions, and, on 27 December, 1834, another title, "The Irish and Catholic Sentinel", was announced; during 1835, however, the paper was called "The Literary and Catholic Sentinel", and on 2 January, 1836, evolved into "The Boston Pilot", a name subsequently changed to "The Pilot". The first editors were George Pepper and Dr. J. S. Bartlett, and the printers and publishers <a href="../cathen/05115c.htm">Patrick Donahoe</a> and Henry L. Devereux. <a href="../cathen/05115c.htm">Patrick Donahoe</a>, who became connected with "The Pilot", in 1835, by the withdrawal of Devereux, assumed the ownership of the enterprise, which in the course of a few years grew into a most important paper of national circulation and influence, advocating <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> interests. The editors under whose direction this success was attained were <a href="../cathen/09492c.htm">Thomas D'Arcy McGee</a>, the Rev. J. P.  Roddan, the <a href="../cathen/06077b.htm">Rev. Joseph M. Finotti</a>, <a href="../cathen/11294c.htm">John Boyle O'Reilly</a>, James J. Roche, and Katherine E. Conway. Over the pen name of "Laffan", Michael Hennessy, of the editorial staff of the New York daily "Times" (born at Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 8 Sept., 1833; died in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, New York, 23 July, 1892), contributed for years weekly articles on <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> historical and genealogical topics that had a very wide popularity. The Rev. John P. Roddan was a <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and on his return home made <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Quincy, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, where, in addition to his pastoral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, he edited "The Pilot". He was a friend of <a href="../cathen/03001a.htm">Orestes A. Brownson</a>, and wrote many articles for his "Review". <a href="../cathen/11294c.htm">Boyle O'Reilly's</a> connexion with "The Pilot" began about 1870, and continued till his death in 1890. On the failure of <a href="../cathen/05115c.htm">Patrick Donahoe's</a> bank and publishing house in 1876, Archbishop Williams came to his rescue and purchased a three-fourths interest in "The Pilot" for the benefit of the depositors in the bank. <a href="../cathen/11294c.htm">O'Reilly</a> held the other fourth, and was given the business as well as the editorial management. In 1890 the venerable <a href="../cathen/05115c.htm">Patrick Donahoe</a>, who had <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravely</a> gone to work to rehabilitate his fortunes, was able to buy back "The Pilot" and resumed its management, which he held until his death, 18 March, 1891. In June, 1908, Archbishop O'Connell bought "The Pilot" from the Donahoe <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and made it the official <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> organ of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and a distinctively <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journal.

<p>When <a href="../cathen/03001a.htm">Orestes A. Brownson</a> <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> he attended the church in East Boston of which the Rev. Nicholas O'Brien was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. Father O'Brien in 1847 persuaded <a href="../cathen/03001a.htm">Brownson</a> to join him in the publication of "The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Observer". He soon <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> his unfitness for the management of the paper, which suspended after two years' existence. In 1888 a number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> organized a corporation which began the publication of "The Sacred Heart Review". Under the direction of Mgr John O'Brien it attained a great <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for enterprise and literary merit. Another <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> paper, "The Republic", was started in 1881 by Patrick Maguire, but more as a political, than a strictly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> organ. In Connecticut Bishop Fenwick was even earlier with his journalistic venture than he was in <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, for the "Catholic Press" was begun in <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford</a>, on 11 July, 1829. In its office he started the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, 19 July, 1829, and there, too, Mass was offered up for the few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> composing the pioneer colony. The "Press" did not long survive, and its successor did not arrive until 1876, when the "Connecticut <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>" was begun. Twelve years later Bishop Tierney purchased this paper and made it, as the "Catholic Transcript", official <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, with the Rev. T. S. Duggan as editor. In Rhode Island the Providence "Visitor" dates from 1877.

<p>The "Catholic Mirror" was established at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> in 1849, and, as an expression of Southern opinion and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> organ, had, in its early years, considerable influence. After the War, however, its prestige waned, and, in spite of several efforts to keep it alive, it suspended in 1908. Kentucky's first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper, the "Catholic Advocate", was founded in 1835 by Ben. J. Webb, then foreman printer of the Louisville "Journal", encouraged in the scheme by the Rev. Dr. Reynolds and the Rev. Dr. Martin J. Spalding. It took the place of the "Minerva", a monthly magazine, founded in 1834, and edited by the faculty of St. Joseph's College, Bardstown. In the old "Advocate" many of the most valuable papers written by Bishop Spalding first appeared. In May, 1858, it was succeeded by the "Catholic Guardian", started in Louisville by the members of the local Particular Council of the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">St. Vincent de Paul Society</a>, which had a fair success, but was forced to suspend by the Civil War in July, 1862. The "Catholic Advocate" was revived later as the "Central Catholic Advocate", and in 1896 the "Midland Review" was started to rival it. There was not room for both so the new absorbed the old journal; but, in spite of the fact that the publication was high-class, it died after a checkered existence of five years. Its editor was a versatile writer of both poetry and prose, Charles J. O'Malley, who left the "Angelus" magazine of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> to edit the Louisville paper. When he found that his field there was too limited for any practical success, he took the editorial management of the "Catholic Sun" of <a href="../cathen/14397a.htm">Syracuse, N.Y.</a>, whence he went to <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> to take charge of the "New World", in which position he died 26 March, 1910. He was born in Kentucky 9 February, 1857. In the period before the Civil War, the "Advocate" and the Baltimore "Mirror" were important and influential factors in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> affairs. The Louisville "Catholic Record", a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> organ, dates from 1878.

<p>Other Southern papers are the <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> "Morning Star", established in 1867, and of which two poets, the Rev. Abram J. Ryan and <a href="../cathen/12639b.htm">James R. Randall</a>, were at times editors; "The Southern Catholic", begun in 1874 at <a href="../cathen/10176a.htm">Memphis</a>, Tenn., suspended, and followed by the "Catholic Journal". In Missouri "The Shepherd of the Valley" started at St. Louis in 1832 with a convert, R. A. Bakewell, as its editor. It suspended in 1838, was revived in 1851, and lasted three years longer. Bakewell, who died in 1909, created much trouble by his editorials, which were used for years as anti-Catholic ammunition by the Native American and <a href="../cathen/08677a.htm">Know-nothing</a> politicians. It was the time of O'Connell's <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> agitation for repeal of the union with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and the Revolutionary movement of 1848, and he also antagonized the <a href="../cathen/08132b.htm">Irish-American</a> element. Although the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> constituency, to which their publications appealed, was mainly <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, many of these convert editors went out of their way to offend <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> susceptibilities. Bakewell's denunciations of Thomas Francis Meagher, John Mitchell, the <a href="../cathen/03140c.htm">Rev. Dr. Cahill</a>, and other popular <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irishmen</a> enraged "my <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> constituents", he tells <a href="../cathen/03001a.htm">Brownson</a>, in a letter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 7 January, 1853. <a href="../cathen/03001a.htm">Brownson</a>, in an article in his "Review" of July, 1854, on Native-Americanism raised a storm by the manner in which he referred to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> element. After it was printed, <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Father Hecker</a>, founder of the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulists</a>, wrote to him: "The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have become mighty tender on the point of Nationality. Your dose on Native-Americanism has operated on them and operated powerfully, and especially at the West. They felt sore, and let me add also weak from its effects. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, I fear, that there may before long come a collision on this point in our Church. The American element is increasing steadily in numerical strength, and will in time predominate; and at the present moment, on account of the state of the public mind, has great moral weight, and this in itself must excite unpleasant feelings on the other side." The "Western Watchman" of St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, edited and controlled by the Rev. D. S. Phelan, may be called the last of the old style personal organs, and has been running a strenuous course since 1865. In 1846 a predecessor, the "Catholic News Letter", began an existence of three years, and in 1878 a stock company was formed which combined an existing weekly, the "Catholic World", until then published in <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, with the "Church Progress" as a rival to the "Watchman". For several years Cond&eacute; B. Pallen held the position of editor of the "Progress".

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> "Catholic Telegraph", established 1831, now the oldest surviving <a href="../cathen/11669b.htm">Catholic publication</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, enjoyed during the early years of <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Bishop Purcell's</a> administration a national <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> under the editorial direction of his brother, the Rev. Edmund Purcell, the <a href="../cathen/13191c.htm">Rev. S.H. Rosecranz</a>, and the Rev. J.F. Callaghan. Bishop Gilmour, of <a href="../cathen/04055a.htm">Cleveland</a>, was a strong advocate of the value of a <a href="../cathen/11669b.htm">Catholic paper</a>, and, beginning in 1874, spent a considerable amount of money, <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, and personal effort in trying to establish the "Catholic Universe" in his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> city. Manly Tello was the editor during its early years. The "Catholic Columbian" of <a href="../cathen/04149a.htm">Columbus</a> started in 1875, and the "Record" of <a href="../cathen/14759a.htm">Toledo</a> in 1905.

<p>The best known and most widely circulated Western publication is the "Ave Maria", a scholarly literary weekly, founded by <a href="../cathen/14150a.htm">Father Sorin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07403a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Cross</a>, at Notre Dame, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, in 1865. For the first issues the editor was <a href="../cathen/06560b.htm">Father Gillespie, C.S.C.</a>, and his sister, the well known <a href="../cathen/06560a.htm">Mother Mary St. Angela Gillespie</a>, was a frequent auxiliary. In 1874 the Rev. Daniel E. Hudson, C.S.C., took charge. An early venture in <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> was the "Western Tablet", in 1852, under the editorial direction of a convert, M. L. Linton. Another editor was James A. Mulligan, more famous as the colonel of the 23rd Illinois volunteers of the Civil War (the Western <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Brigade). He was born at <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a>, New York, 25 June, 1830, and went to <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> in 1836. He studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> before becoming an editor. His heroic defence of Lexington, Ky., in September, 1861, where, with 2800 men, he withstood an army of 22,000, made him a popular hero. He died, 26 July, 1864, from wounds received two days before at the battle of Kernstown, Va. The "Western Tablet" did not survive, and it had several ill-starred successors until the "New World" appeared in 1892. Three years later the "Western Catholic" was printed at Quincy, Ill. The "Michigan <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>" of <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a> dates from 1872. In October, 1869, the "Star of Bethlehem" was established as a monthly at <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, by the St. Louis Brothers. Two years later they sold the paper to the "Catholic Vindicator", which had been established in November, 1870, at Monroe, Win., by Dr. D. W. Nolan and the Rev. John Casey. The "Catholic Vindicator" and "Star of Bethlehem" were consolidated, and established in <a href="../cathen/10319a.htm">Milwaukee</a>, November, 1871. In November, 1878, Edward A. Bray and the Rev. G. L.  Willard, having purchased the "Catholic Vindicator" from Dr. D. W. Nolan, changed the name to the "Catholic Citizen". In 1880 H. J. Desmond undertook its editorial management.

<p>Other Western papers are the "Catholic Tribune", <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a> (1899); "Intermountain Catholic", <a href="../cathen/13404c.htm">Salt Lake City</a>, <a href="../cathen/15238a.htm">Utah</a> (1899); the "Catholic Bulletin", <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, Minnesota (1911); "True Voice", <a href="../cathen/11249b.htm">Omaha</a>, Nebraska (1903); "Catholic Register", <a href="../cathen/08602a.htm">Kansas City</a>, Missouri (1899); "Catholic Sentinel", <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a>, <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a> (1870). In <a href="../cathen/13439c.htm">San Francisco</a>, <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, the "Monitor" is one of the veterans dating as far back as 1852. Later enterprises are the "Leader" of the same city (1902); the "Catholic Herald" of Sacramento (1908); and "Tidings" of <a href="../cathen/10532a.htm">Los Angeles</a> (1895).
<h2>Magazines and periodicals</h2>

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> magazine was the "Metropolitan, or <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Monthly Magazine" issued at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, Md., January, 1830. It lived a year. Another "Metropolitan" began in February, 1853, but also failed to make a permanent impression. In January, 1842, the "Religious Cabinet", a monthly, edited by <a href="../cathen/15611a.htm">Rev. Dr. Charles I. White</a> and Rev. James Dolan, was started in <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. After a year its title was changed to the "United States Catholic Magazine", which lasted until 1847. The <a href="../cathen/15611a.htm">Rev. Dr. White</a> and <a href="../cathen/07564a.htm">Dr. J.V. Huntington</a> were its most noted editors, and the contributors included Archbishop M. J. Spalding, Bishop Michael O'Connor, the Rev. <a href="../cathen/12116a.htm">Dr. C.C. Pise</a>, and B. N. Campbell. In New York the "Catholic Expositor", edited by the <a href="../cathen/12116a.htm">Rev. Dr. Charles C. Pise</a> and the Rev. Felix Varela, lasted three years (1842-44). Father Varela was also instrumental in the publication in New York, by C. H. Gottsberger, of the "Young Catholic's Magazine" in March, 1838; it was suspended in February, 1840. The "National Catholic Register", a monthly, the first issue of which appeared at Philadelphia, in January, 1844, did not last long.

<p>When <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Father Hecker</a> started the "Catholic World", in 1865, its editor for the first five years was <a href="../cathen/07148a.htm">John R.G. Hassard</a>, and the publisher Lawrence Kehoe (born in Co. Wexford, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 24 July, 1832; died in <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, New York, 20 Feb., 1890). To the latter was due much of the early success of the magazine and of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Publication Society. Under the patronage of the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brothers</a> the "De La. Salle Monthly" was begun in 1867. Its name was later changed to the "Manhattan Monthly" and the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> patriot and poet John Savage was for a time its editor. The "Young Crusader" of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> (1868), "Catholic Record", Philadelphia (1871), "Central Magazine", St. Louis (1872), "Donahoe's Magazine", <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> (1878), follow in the list of failures. The "Rosary Magazine," begun by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> in New York, in 1891, was transferred to Somerset, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> have published, since 1908, at <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>, "The Magnificat". In April, 1866, the <a href="../cathen/13738a.htm">Rev. B. Sestini, S.J.</a>, founded the "Messenger of the Sacred Heart" at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown</a>, D. C.; thence it was moved to Woodstock, Md., next to Philadelphia, and finally to New York, in 1893. Later, in 1907, the "Messenger of the Sacred Heart" was devoted entirely to the interests of the Confraternity of the Sacred Heart, and the "Messenger", a separate magazine of general literary character, was issued. The latter publication, in April, 1910, was changed to a weekly review, "America", which, by authority of the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, was made the joint work of the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in North America. It took immediate rank as an exponent of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> opinion with a national scope and circulation. The Rev. John J. Wynne, S.J., was its founder and first editor-in-chief. The Catholic University, Washington, publishes two magazines, the "Catholic University Bulletin" and the "Catholic Educational Review" (1911), and nearly all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colleges and the academies have monthlies edited and compiled by the students.

<p>For historical work Philadelphia has two quarterly magazines, "American <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Historical Researches" and "Records of the American Catholic Historical Society". New York has one, "Historical Records and Studies", of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Historical Society. When the reading-circle movement began, Warren E. Mosher (born at <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, N. Y., 1860; died at New Rochelle, N. Y., 22 March, 1906), who was one of the founders of the <a href="../cathen/14334a.htm">Catholic Summer School</a>, started the "Catholic Reading Circle Review". This title was later changed to "Mosher's Magazine", but the periodical did not survive its founder. The "Catholic Fortnightly Review", of Techny, Ill., edited by Arthur Preuss, and the "St. John's Quarterly", of <a href="../cathen/14397a.htm">Syracuse, N.Y.</a>, edited by the Rev. Dr. J. F. Mullany, are personal organs of the editors. "Benziger's Magazine", New York, 1898, and "Extension", <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, 1907, are illustrated monthlies. The "Ecclesiastical Review" Philadelphia (1889), supplies a varied and interesting quantity of professional information for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. An attempt was made to offer from the same office in "The Dolphin", a similarly important publication for the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, but it failed to attract the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> support. Another failure, for a like reason, was made in New York in the "New York Review, a journal of Ancient Faith and Modern Thought", issued bi-monthly from St. Joseph's Seminary, Dunwoodie, June, 1905-May-June, 1908.

<p>The first quarterly review established in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was the "American Review of History and Politics", founded by a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, Robert Walsh, at Philadelphia, and of which two volumes were published (1811-12). Walsh was born at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, Md., in 1784, and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at <a href="../cathen/06458a.htm">Georgetown College</a>. He was a man of great literary ability, and died <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> consul at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 7 Feb., 1859. The first and most important <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> quarterly was "Brownson's Quarterly Review", which <a href="../cathen/03001a.htm">Orestes A. Brownson</a> began in January, 1844, at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> (moved to New York, 1855), after his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a>. He suspended its publication in 1864 "because he was unwilling", he said, "to continue a periodical which had not the full confidence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>". It was revived in 1873, and finally ceased publication in October, 1875, with the statement: "I discontinue the Review solely on account of my precarious health and the failure of my eyes." The first number of the "American <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Quarterly Review" was issued at Philadelphia, in January, 1876, and the <a href="../cathen/04356b.htm">Rev. James A. Corcoran</a>, George D. Wolf, and Archbishop Patrick John Ryan are notable as its editors. The "Globe Review", of Philadelphia, edited by the erratic William Henry Thorne, had a short career of violent iconoclastic character.
<h2>Special organs</h2>

<p>The fraternal organizations have their special organs &mdash; as, for example, the "National Hibernian" (Washington, 1900), of the Ancient Order of Hibernians &mdash; which devote their pages to the interests of the social organizations which they represent. The German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press, led by two influential dailies, has made much more substantial and practical progress than its English contemporaries. Prominent among the editors who contributed to these achievements were <a href="../cathen/11215a.htm">Dr. Maximilian Oertel</a> and Edward Frederic Reinhold Preuss (born at K&ouml;nigsberg, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, 10 July, 1834; died at St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, July, 1904). There are sixty-nine Polish papers printed in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> twenty odd being thoroughly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and the others ranging from neutrality to violent anti-clericalism. Of the nine dailies four are distinctively <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. The oldest paper is the "Gazeta Katolicka", founded by <a href="../cathen/16007b.htm">Father Barzynski</a>. He also founded, in 1889, the "Dziennik Chicagoski" (Chicago Daily News), the controlling interest in which is owned by the Resurrectionist Fathers. There are eighteen Polish papers printed in <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, four of them dailies, and of the eighteen seven are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a> have a number of prosperous periodicals including 1 daily, 1 semi-weekly, 2 weeklies, 1 monthly, and 1 bi-monthly. (See also <a href="../cathen/02620a.htm">BOHEMIANS IN THE UNITED STATES</a>; <a href="../cathen/06271c.htm">FRENCH CATHOLICS IN THE UNITED STATES</a>; GERMANS IN THE UNITED STATES: <em>The Press</em>; ITALIANS IN THE UNITED STATES: <em>Religious Organizations</em>; <a href="../cathen/12204c.htm">POLES IN THE UNITED STATES</a>.)
