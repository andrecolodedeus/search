<h1>Periodical Literature &mdash; Austria</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press is represented in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> by 140 newspapers and 152 other periodicals. Of the former, 79 are in German; 22 in the Czech, or <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a>, language; 16 in Polish; 3 in <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a>; 8 in Slovenian; 5 in Croatian; 7 in Italian.

<p>The distribution of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> daily papers is as follows: Lower <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, 4, of which 2 appear twice daily. Of these the "Reichspost" (Dr. Funder, editor-in-chief) is issued twice daily, and prints 16,000 copies to each edition; "Vaterland" (P. Siebert, editor-in-chief), two editions daily of 2500 copies each; "Neuigkeits-Weltblatt", August Kirsch, owner, 5000 copies to each edition; "Neue Zeitung", 50,000 copies to each edition. All these papers are published at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. Upper <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> has the "Linzer Volksblatt", 4500 copies to each edition; in <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, the "Salzburger Chronik", 3500 copies; in <a href="../cathen/14318a.htm">Styria</a>, the "Grazer Volksblatt", 8500 copies; the "Kleine Zeitung", 26,000 copies to an edition, the last two published at <a href="../cathen/06733d.htm">Graz</a>. In the Tyrol 3 daily papers are published: at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a> the "Allgemeiner Tiroler Anzeiger", with an edition of 3000 copies, and the "Neue Tiroler Stimmen", with an edition of 1500 copies; at <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, the Italian "Trentino", with an edition of 5000 copies. At Bregenz in Vorarlberg is published the "Vorarlberger Volksblatt", with an edition of 3500 copies. <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> has only one daily in the Czech language, the "Cech" of Prague, with an edition of 3800 copies; in <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a>, the Czech "Hlas" is published at <a href="../cathen/03011c.htm">Br&uuml;nn</a>, 2000 copies to an edition. Polish papers are the "Czas", published at <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>, 5000 copies twice daily; the "Gazeta Lwowska", 2000 copies to an edition; the "Gazeta Narodova", published at <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>, 4500 copies; the "Glos narodu", published at <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, 8800 copies twice daily; two other papers at <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a> are the "Ruslau" and the "Przeglad", each 5000 copies to an edition.

In <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> the "Hrvatska kruna" is published in Croatian, with an edition of 9000 copies.

<p>The local Press, weekly and monthly, is very large; this is especially the case in the Alpine provinces and northern <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. The learned periodicals show work of high quality. Among them should be mentioned: the "Kultur", published at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> by the Leo-Gesellschaft, and the "Allgemeines Literaturblatt", also the "Correspondenzblatt f&uuml;r den Clerus", edition of 7000 copies, the "Theologischpraktische Quartalschrift", published at <a href="../cathen/09273a.htm">Linz</a>, edition of 12,000 copies; "Anthropos" at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, "Christliche Kunstbl&auml;tter" at <a href="../cathen/09273a.htm">Linz</a>, "Kunstfreund at <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>, "Immergr&uuml;n" at Warnsdorf, "Vlast" at Prague. As regards illustrated <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> periodicals the non-Catholic Press is decidedly in the lead.

<p>The actual condition of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> is far from satisfactory, though by no means hopeless. Its defects are fully recognized by those who are best able to remedy them. The daily papers, in particular, suffer from the lack of funds. There is no wealthy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> middle class, the prosperous city population being to a great extent (politically at least) anti-Catholic, while most of the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are found among the rural population, who, in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, care little for newspapers. This state of things renders <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journalism an uninviting field for business investment, and the dearth of capital employed in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journalism as business enterprise is only inadequately supplied by donations from the nobility and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who have neither the inclination nor the experience to secure an advantageous employment of the funds subscribed by them. Subsisting on these slender contributions by supporters of the party, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> papers are unable to make any efforts for their own improvement or for the increase of their circulation by advertising; they are party institutions, not business enterprises, and have to be satisfied with keeping their expenditures down to the limits of the party contributions. At the same time, the conduct of the papers is in the hands of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who, besides having no pecuniary interest in pushing them as enterprises, generally lack journalistic training. This technical inferiority, indeed, affects the whole working value of the Austrian <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press; the remuneration of contributors, as well as of editors, being considerably below the standard of the Liberal Press, the best talent of the country avoids <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journalism and enlists itself in the service of the opposition. Lastly, its financial weakness places the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press at a serious disadvantage in regard to the supply of scientific matter and foreign news, both of which are abundantly commanded by the affluent Liberal Press.

<p>These enormous difficulties are to some extent counteracted, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and self-sacrifice, but the strain of ceaseless effort necessarily results in a lack of effective force. External difficulties aggravate the disheartening conditions. The control of public affairs by a Liberal Press lasted so long that the whole reading public, good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> included, became habituated to it, and this acquiescence in a wrong state of things resulted in <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> inertia. Only in the first decade of the present century did the more practically <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> elements begin to realize that those aristocratic-conservative influences which are popularly regarded as reactionary are not necessarily the most favourable to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests. The Christian-Socialist popular party has taken up the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> programme and thus opened a way for it among the masses; a spirited agitation resulted in diminishing the political power of the Liberal Press; but, in spite of all this, the public, long accustomed to the style of Liberal journalism, find <a href="../cathen/11669b.htm">Catholic periodicals</a> lacking in piquancy.

<p>One more external difficulty with which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> periodical literature in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> &mdash; in contrast to the conditions of United <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> &mdash; has to contend, is the multiplicity of races and languages among the populations of the empire. The national rivalries are not always held in check by the profession of a common <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of each race insist upon maintaining distinct <a href="../cathen/11669b.htm">Catholic periodicals</a> in their respective languages; hence a large number of periodicals each with a circulation far too small to ensure success. This difficulty has recently increased rather than diminished. The "Vaterland", e.g., a <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> periodical, formerly read by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> throughout the Austrian crown lands, irrespective of their own national languages, has now had its circulation curtailed through this cause. And in general it may be said that no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> paper in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> can count upon a circulation among all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> under the Austrian Crown; a separate Press has to be organized for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of each language.

<p>The result of all these internal and external difficulties is the present embarrassed position of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. Attempts have been made, with the best intentions, at various times, by <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, corporate bodies, and congresses; all, however, have failed of lasting success, because they lacked system and organization. It is greatly to the credit of some that this defect was finally recognized, and an effort made to correct it, by the <a href="../cathen/12139a.htm">Pius-Verein</a>. As attempts to obtain money for the Press from the few rich have failed, a constant appeal is made to the great mass of people of small means, and large sums are thus collected. In this way the question of means is to be settled. By constant agitation, or by frequent meetings, local groups, and confidential agents, the apathy of the people is to be ended.

<p>Although the condition, taken as a whole, of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> is not prosperous, still the great efforts that have been made of late years and are still making with ever-increasing <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, at the present time, justify the hope that the apathy of large sections of the reading public may be overcome, an appreciation aroused of the importance of a Press that is honourable and steadfast in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Only when this is attained will the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> in money and labour that have been made for many years for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press bear fruit, and a powerful press will be the strongest protection against the opponents of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>.
