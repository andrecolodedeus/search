<h1>Periodical Literature &mdash; Switzerland</h1>  

<p>The history of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> journalism goes back to the beginning of the seventeenth century, the first <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> newspaper being issued at Basle in 1610. It is significant that the early newspapers of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, which was at that time only nominally free, hardly discussed political matters excepting those of foreign countries and this was the case until well into the eighteenth century. The censorship exercised at that time was so strict that it did not seem advisable to raise questions concerning home politics. Even in the middle of the eighteenth century, writers of objectionable articles were bluntly notified to give up writing for newspapers. The political newspaper did not appear until at the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century, when the freedom of the Press was gradually allowed. This freedom, however, for a long time existed chiefly in the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> cantons. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> journalism in the present sense is a recent growth, and does not extend farther back than the third decade of the last century, when the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspapers appeared at <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a> and St. Gall. The reasons for this were partly of a political and partly of an <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> character. <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> is a federation of twenty-five cantons, each of which up to 1848 was absolutely sovereign and up to 1874 was practically sovereign. Even now the cantons possess many of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of sovereignty, though not as many as the States of the American Union. Hence the political Press has mainly a cantonal or local character, dealing with the interests of the sub-divisions of a small state.

<p>All the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons are relatively small, some of them not having more than 20,000 or 30,000 inhabitants. Moreover, the population is mostly rural. Except Lucerne and Fribourg, they do not contain important cities, and, finally, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party for many years totally misjudged the importance and influence of the political Press in general, and let itself be outstripped by their opponents. The first strong impulse to the founding of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press was given by the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1847, called the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the <em>Sonderbund;</em> the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> ended with the defeat of the seven <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons, which placed them largely at the mercy of a violent <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a>. This was still more the case in the cantons made up of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> districts. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press grew very rapidly during the sixth decade of the past century and still more so during the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em> of the seventies. More recently a large emigration of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> into <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> cantons led to the founding of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspapers in these cantons. <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> has now a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons, in those where <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> are on a parity, and in the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> cantons.

<p>The statistics are as follows: In 1911 <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> had 399 political newspapers, of which 64 were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Of these <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> papers, 1 is issued 7 times a week, 10 are issued 6 times weekly, 1 is issued 5 times weekly, 3 appear 4 times weekly, 22 appear 3 times, 13 appear twice weekly, and 14 once a week. 50 are published in German, 9 in French, 4 in Italian, and 1 in Rh&aelig;to-Romanic. The number of copies issued at an edition are, taken altogether, as follows: the 4 daily papers, including 1 issued 5 times weekly, have a circulation of 52,000 copies; 3 that appear 4 times weekly, 8000 copies; 22 appearing 3 times weekly, 57,000; 13 appearing twice weekly, 30,000; 14 appearing once a week, 60,000. Thus the 64 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> papers have a total circulation of 207,000. The Canton of Aargau has 6; Appenzell Outer Rhodes, none; Appenzell Inner Rhodes, 1; half-canton of Basel-Stadt, 1; half-canton of Basel-Land, none; Berne, 3; Fribourg, 4; St. Gall, 12; Geneva, 1; Glarus, 1; Grisons, 3; Lucerne, 5; Neuch&acirc;tel, none; Schaffhausen, 1; Schwyz, 5; Solothurn, 3; Ticcino, 3; Thurgau, 1; half-canton of Nidwald, 1; half-canton of Obwald, 1; Uri, 1; Vaud, none; Valais, 5; Zug, 1; Zurich, 4. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cantons have 28 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> papers, including 3 dailies, the cantons having parity, 27, including 5 dailies; the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> cantons, 9, including 4 dailies and 1 appearing 5 times weekly.

<p>Although the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> has grown enormously in the last thirty years, and need not fear comparison with that of other countries, even entirely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, yet the result is much less satisfactory and even disappointing if we compare the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> with the anti-Catholic press. According to the census of 1910 <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> has in round numbers 3,700,000 inhabitants. Of these about 1,500,000 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. From this we should deduct the liberal <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, a fairly large element, and the foreign workmen, Italian men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, journeymen-mechanics, servants, etc., that are only temporary residents. Consequently only about 1,200,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> can be taken into consideration for the present purpose. We shall compare only the dailies. A comparison between the weekly papers would not yield a much better result, as is evident from the fact that there are only 64 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> political papers to counterbalance 399 non-Catholic, and for 269 non-Catholic weeklies that appear 1 to 4 times weekly there are only 53 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ones. The daily non-Catholic Press of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> includes 67 newspapers; of these 44 are extreme Liberal, that is, hostile to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and in part disposed to renew the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>;</em> 3 of these appear twice a day, total circulation, 244,000; 7 Liberal-Conservative, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and generally friendly to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, total circulation 46,000; 10 Social-Democratic and belonging to the Democratic party of the Left, partly hostile to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> but not inclined to carry on a <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>,</em> total circulation 54,000; 7 politically indifferent, total circulation 164,000. Taken altogether, as before said, 67 papers with a total circulation of 508,000, opposed to which are 12 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> dailies, one of which appears 5 times weekly, with a total circulation of 52,000. In proportion to the population there should be at least 20 with a circulation of 150,000. The total circulation of all the 64 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> papers is 207,000 copies, not the half of the total circulation of the non-Catholic dailies, and, the total circulation of the extreme Liberal dailies alone is much larger than the total circulation of all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> papers taken together. It should be further added that up to now the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press contains no paper of two daily editions, and that the best non-Catholic newspapers exceed the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ones in copiousness of matter, etc. It is also worthy of notice that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> daily with the largest circulation, the "Vaterland", has about 11,000 subscribers among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, while among the 63,000 subscribers to the politically and ecclesiastically indifferent "Z&uuml;rcher Tagesanzeiger", there are about 20,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Again, it is not a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> weekly that has the largest circulation among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but it is the rather Liberally inclined "Schweiz. Wochenzeitung" of <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>. Yet the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party is the second in strength in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>.

<p>But the Liberal and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> parties are socially and economically in a far better position, they control the larger part of the cities, while the majority of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population represent the country and mountain districts, which have less need of a daily paper. On the other hand, the daily Press of the Social Democratic party and of the Democratic party of the Left have a total circulation of 54,000, although they draw their readers almost entirely from the lower classes of the population. However, the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press is earnest, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a>, and on the whole is able and efficient, and exerts a greater influence than is the case with the greater part of the Liberal Press. The principal <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspapers of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> are: the "Vaterland", founded at <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a> in 1873; the "Neuen-Z&uuml;rcher Nachrichten", established at <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a> in 1904; the "Ostschweiz" in 1874 at St. Gall; the "Basler Volksblatt", in 1873 at Basle; and the "Libert&eacute;", in 1865 at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>. Among the pioneers, now deceased, of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> special mention should be made of: Bishop Augustinus Egger, Landamman Baumgartner, and Joseph Gm&uuml;r of St. Gall, Schultheiss von Segesser of <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, Landamman H&auml;nggi of Solothurn, the episcopal commissary von Ah, and Landamman Th. Wirz of Obwald, Mgr Jurt of Basle, and Canon Schorderet of Fribourg. Among <a href="../cathen/11669b.htm">Catholic periodicals</a> the following should be mentioned: "Die schweiz. Kirchenzeitung", of <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> review that has a high reputation among the German <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> also: the "Schweiz. Rundschau", issued at Stans, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scientific and literary review; the "Schweiz. sozialpolit. Bl&auml;tter", of Fribourg; the "Alte und Neue Welt", of <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>, an illustrated <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> paper, which has a large circulation also in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>; the "Zukunft", of <a href="../cathen/05367a.htm">Einsiedeln</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> review for the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> associations for young men; various religious Sunday papers for the people; an illustrated supplement for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspapers; a large number of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendars</a>, as well as the organs of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, etc. The five papers for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> workmen and working <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> have been included among the political newspapers.
