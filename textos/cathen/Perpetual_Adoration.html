<h1>Perpetual Adoration</h1>  

<p>A term broadly used to designate the practically uninterrupted <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. The term is used in a truly literal sense, i.e. to indicate that the <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a> is physically perpetual; and, more frequently, in a moral sense, when it is interrupted only for a short time, or for imperative reasons, or through uncontrollable circumstances, to be resumed, however, when possible, or it may indicate an uninterrupted <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a> for a longer or shorter period, a day, or a few days, as in the <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06151a.htm">Forty Hours</a>, or it may designate an uninterrupted <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a> in one special church, or in different churches in a locality or <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, or country, or throughout the world.

<p>No trace of the existence of any such extra-liturgical cultus of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> can be found in the records of the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/09436c.htm">Christian Lupus</a>, indeed, argues that in the days of <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> and <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> it was customary for the <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophytes</a> to <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a>, for eight days following their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05713a.htm">Blessed Sacrament exposed</a>, but no sound <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> is adduced. It first appears in the later <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, about the beginning of the thirteenth century. It certainly may be conjectured that such <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a> was really connoted by the fact of reservation in the early <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, especially in view of the evident desire to have the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Eucharist</a> represent the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity</a> and continuity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as it is unlikely that there should not be some continuation of the <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a> evidently given to the <a href="../cathen/07489d.htm">Host</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14383a.htm">Synaxis</a>. But such conjecture cannot be insisted upon

<ul><li>in view of the remarkable fact that no trace of any such <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a> is to be found in the lives of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> noted for their devotion to the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> in <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>; thus it is remarkable that <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius</a> in <a href="../cathen/14224b.htm">"The Spiritual Exercises"</a>, when directing attention to the abiding <a href="../cathen/12396a.htm">presence of God</a> with His creatures as a motive for awakening <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> says not a word of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>; <li>because of the practice of even the present-day <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> which, although <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> explicitly in <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">transubstantiation</a>, has never considered <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> "our companion and refuge as well as our food" (Thurston).</ul>

<p>The slowness with which the <a href="../cathen/05713a.htm">Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament</a> came into vogue, and the also slow development of the custom of <a href="../cathen/15483b.htm">paying visits to the Blessed Sacrament</a> [<a href="../cathen/02782b.htm">Father Bridgett</a> asserting that he had not come across one clear example in <a href="../cathen/05431b.htm">England</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15483b.htm">visit to the Blessed Sacrament</a> in pre-Reformation times (Thurston, ib.)], render it increasingly difficult to make out a case for any <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a>, perpetual or temporary, outside the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> and <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, as these various forms of <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">devotion</a> are closely linked together. Most <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgists</a> rightly attribute the <a href="../cathen/05713a.htm">Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament</a> and its special <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a> to the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Feast of Corpus Christi</a>. But it is worthy of note that the first recorded instance of Perpetual Adoration antedates <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>, and occurred at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. On 11 September 1226, in compliance with the wish of Louis VII, who had just been victorious over the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigensians</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, veiled, was <a href="../cathen/05713a.htm">exposed</a> in the Chapel of the Holy Cross, as an act of thanksgiving. So great was the throng of adorers that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Pierre de Corbie, judged it expedient to continue the <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a> by night, as well as by day, a proposal that was subsquently ratified by the approval of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. This really Perpetual Adoration, interrupted in 1792, was resumed in 1829, through the efforts of the "Confraternity of Penitents-Gris" (Annales de Saint-Sacrement, III, 90). It is said that there has been a Perpetual Adoration in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/09417b.htm">Lugo, Spain</a>, for more than a thousand years in expiation of the <a href="../cathen/12429b.htm">Priscillian heresy</a>. (<a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a> refers to this in an official letter to the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Cardinal Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 1895.)
<h2>History</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/05713a.htm">Exposition</a> and consequently <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a> became comparatively general only in the fifteenth century. It is curious to note that these <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adorations</a> were usually for some special reason, e.g. for the cure of a sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, or, on the eve of an <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">execution</a>, in the hope that the condemned would die a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> death. The Order of the "Religiosi bianchi del corpo di Ges&ugrave; Christo," a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/12711a.htm">reform</a>, united to <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> in 1393, and approved later as a separate community, devoted themselves to the <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a> founded in the <a href="../cathen/05534c.htm">Escorial</a> the Vigil of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> in successive pairs remaining constantly, night and day, before the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. But, practically, the devotion of the <a href="../cathen/06151a.htm">Forty Hours</a>, begun in 1534, and officially established in 1592, developed the really general Perpetual Adoration, spreading as it did from the Adoration in one or more churches in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> until it gradually extended throughout the world, so that it may be truly said that during every hour of the year the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, solemnly <a href="../cathen/05713a.htm">exposed</a> is <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adored</a> by multitudes of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. In 1641 <a href="../cathen/12773a.htm">Baron de Renty</a>, famous for devotion to the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, founded in St. Paul's <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> an <a href="../cathen/02005b.htm">association</a> of ladies for practically a Perpetual Adoration; and, in 1648, at St-Sulpice the Perpetual Adoration, day and night, was established as a reparation for an outrage committed by thieves against the <a href="../cathen/07489d.htm">Sacred Host</a>. The Perpetual Adoration was founded at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, in 1667, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu. In various places, and by different people, <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a>, new foundations have been made since then, the history of which can be traced in the valuable "Histoire du Sacrement de l'Eucharistie," by Jules Corblet (II, xviii). The last development that it is important to notice here is the organization at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 1882, of "The Perpetual Adoration of Catholic Nations represented In the Eternal City". Its object was to offer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a <a href="../cathen/12775a.htm">reparation</a> that is renewed daily by some of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> nations represented in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in the churches in which the <a href="../cathen/06151a.htm">Forty Hours</a> was being held, as follows:


<ul><li>on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> by Portugal, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>; <li>on Monday by <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and Greece; <li>on Tuesday by <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; <li>on Wednesday by North and South America, and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, <li>on Thursday by <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; <li>on Friday by the Catholic Missions and <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>; <li>on Saturday by <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>.</ul>

<p>This society has affiliations throughout the world.

<p>It is interesting to note the propagation in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries of the Perpetual Adoration in all the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> of certain <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The earliest mention of this practices is in 1658, when the churches in the <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Diocese of Chartres</a> were opened for this purpose from six o'clock in the morning to six in the evening and wherever there were <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities possessing a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> the <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a> was continued day and night. So, too, in Amiens (1658); in Lyons (1667); Evreux (1672); Rouen (1700), Boulogne (1753). In this last diocese the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were divided into twelve groups, representing the twelve months of the year, each group containing as many <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> as there were days in the month it represented. To each church in every group was assigned a day for the <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a>. In <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> the work of the Perpetual Adoration, begun in 1674, fell into desuetude, but was re-established in 1802, and on a larger scale in 1873. Interrupted in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, the Perpetual Adoration was restored under Louis Philippe in some <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> but especially in 1848, by the influence of the celebrated pianist <a href="../cathen/04094c.htm">Hermann Cohen</a>, who afterwards became a Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> under the name of P&egrave;re Augustin of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. In six <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> the <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a> is strictly perpetual. It flourishes also in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, in different <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, in Mexico, in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, and other South American countries, in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, and even in Oceanica.

<p>The Nocturnal Adoration is carried on in many countries by associations of men. The first confraternity for the Nocturnal Adoration called "Pia Unione di Adoratori del SS. Sagramento" was founded in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in 1810. In <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, before the passage of the Associations Law, the Nocturnal Adoration was practised in upwards of one hundred and thirty <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> by more than twenty-five hundred men. The Nocturnal Adoration, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, founded in 1851, and erected into an archconfraternity in 1858, practically completes the chain of associations that render perpetual, in a strict sense, the <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. It would be impossible to give here an adequate notice of the enormous number of Eucharistic associations, lay and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a>, formed for the work of the Perpetual Adoration. In addition to the communities and associations mentioned above, we shall here enumerate only the most important <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> whose object has been Perpetual Adoration. A comparatively exhaustive list will be found in Corblet (op. cit., II, 444 sqq.). <ul><li>The Society of Picpus was founded in 1594, having as one of their objects to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the hidden life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by the Perpetual Adoration of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. <li>In 1868 the privilege of Perpetual Adoration was granted by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius IX</a> to the Sisters of the Second <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Quellins, near <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. This order was founded by <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> himself in 1206, the constitutions being based on the <a href="../cathen/02079b.htm">Rule of St. Augustine</a>. The privilege of Perpetual Adoration was extended to the few <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, such as those of <a href="../cathen/10779c.htm">Newark</a>, <a href="../cathen/10790a.htm">New Jersey</a>, and Hunt's Point, <a href="../cathen/11020a.htm">New York City</a>, which were founded from Quellins, but not to the other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the order. <li>In 1647 the <a href="../cathen/02507a.htm">Bernardines</a> of Port Royal were associated to the Institute of the Perpetual Adoration of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, and joined to their original name that of the Daughters of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. <li>Anne of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> founded, through M&egrave;re Mechtilde, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, the first community of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of the Perpetual Adoration of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, in 1654, an institute widely spread throughout continental <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The members take a solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of Perpetual Adoration. During the conventual Mass one of the community kneels in the middle of the choir, having a rope around her neck, and holding a lighted torch, as a reparation to the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Eucharist</a> so frequently insulted. Their password is "Praised be the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament of the Altar</a>". It is their salutation in their letters and visits, at the beginning of their office, the first word pronounced on waking, the last said on retiring. <li>The Order of Religious of St. Norbert, founded in 1767 at Coire (Switzerland), perpetually <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adore</a> the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, singing German <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>. <li>The <a href="../cathen/11698c.htm">Perpetual Adorers of the Blessed Sacrament</a> (women), commonly known as Sacramentines, were founded at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, by a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> sister, and were approved by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> in 1807. During their nocturnal <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a> the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> remains in the tabernacle. <li>The <a href="../cathen/11698b.htm">Sisters of the Perpetual Adoration</a> at <a href="../cathen/12611a.htm">Quimper</a> were founded in 1835. In addition to the Perpetual Adoration, they train young girls to become domestics, or teach them a trade. <li>A Congregation of <a href="../cathen/11698a.htm">Religious of the Perpetual Adoration</a> was founded in 1845 at Eisiedeln, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. The sisters wear a small <a href="../cathen/11344a.htm">ostensorium</a> on the breast, to indicate their special function of perpetual adorers. <li>The Congregation of Ladies of the Adoration of Reparation, founded after the Revolution of 1848, have three classes of members, whose common <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> is the Perpetual Adoration. <li>The Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/11698b.htm">Sisters of the Perpetual Adoration</a> and of the Poor Churches, founded originally in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, has houses all over the world. By a special <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Congregation of Indulgences the seat of this archconfraternity was transferred to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1879, where it absorbed the archconfraternity of the same name already existing there. Its work, however, is not strictly a Perpetual Adoration. <li>The Society of the Most <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, founded in 1857 by P&egrave;re Eymard, is perhaps the best known of all. The members are divided into three classes: (a) the religious contemplatives <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the perpetual <a href="../cathen/01151a.htm">adoration</a>; (b) the religious, both contemplative and active, who are engaged in the sacred ministry; (c) a <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laics</a>, who follow only a part of the rule.
