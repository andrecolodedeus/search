<h1>Perpetual Adorers of the Blessed Sacrament</h1>  

<p>(Sacramentines.)

<p>Anton <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, b. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 23 Feb., 1601, the founder of the first order exclusively devoted to the practice of Perpetual Adoration, entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a>, and after <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> was named master of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and later <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. "During the seventeenth century", we read in his works, edited by Potton, "we find only two <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders that have Perpetual Adoration. The first is that of the <a href="../cathen/02599a.htm">Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament</a>, founded by P&egrave;re Antoine, O.P.; the second that of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Adoratrices, founded first at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and afterwards in several other cities, by the celebrated Mother Mechtilde. This religious, supported by powerful protectors, easily accomplished her task. Perpetual Adoration began among her daughters in 1654, while the Sisters of the Blessed Sacraments received the privilege of reserving the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> only in 1659. But P&egrave;re Antoine* had begun the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/02599a.htm">Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament</a> about 1639, while M&egrave;re Mechtilde's work appears, according to <a href="../cathen/07214a.htm">H&eacute;lyot</a>, to date back no further, even in project, than 1651. P&egrave;re Antoine* may, then, be considered as possessing priority, especially as his order was intended solely for the worship of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, while that of M&egrave;re Mechtilde, although in existence, was adapted to that end only at a later period". <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne's</a> "Dictionnaire des Ordres religieux" mentions no <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order exclusively destined for the worship of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, except that of P&egrave;re Antoine, and that of the Adoration R&eacute;paratrice, established in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for the first time in 1848.

<p>In 1639 P&egrave;re Antoine* began his work at <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>. Sister Anne Negrel was named the first superioress. But the definitive establishment of the religious took place only in 1659-60, when Mgr de Puget, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, erected them into a congregation under the title of <a href="../cathen/02599a.htm">Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament</a>. The final formalities for the approval of the order having been concluded in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1680), <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> expedited a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, which could not be put in execution because of a change of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> issued a new <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> the same year in which the Apostolic Process was opened for the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of its founder. The only foundation of the order in the eighteenth century was made at Boll&egrave;ne (Vaucluse) in 1725. Sixty years later, under the government of M&egrave;re de La Fare, this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> had the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of offering to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> thirteen victims, who succeeded one another on the scaffold, from the fifth to the twenty-sixth of July, 1794. The process for the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of these <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> was opened at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, January, 1907.

<p>M&egrave;re de La Fare, having escaped the guillotine, gathered together her community in 1802, and made a foundation at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in 1807. The same year a Sacramentine of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Aix-en-Provence. In 1816 the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> was reopened, and M&egrave;re de La Fare made a new foundation at Carpentras. In 1859 six religious of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a> founded a house at Bernay, <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, and in 1863 some sisters from Boll&egrave;ne founded a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Perpetual Adoration at Taunton, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Oxford also has a foundation. All the houses of this order are autonomous and dependent on the <a href="../cathen/11284b.htm">ordinary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, who is their superior. In consequence of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of religious congregations in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the Sacramentines of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to abandon their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. The four other houses of Southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, being authorized by the Government, still subsist, though their boarding-school is closed. The Sacramentines of Bernay at the time of the expulsion, July, 1903, were compelled to close their boarding-school and go into exile. Thirteen of the sisters retired to <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and founded a house at Hal. The rest of their community settled in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> at Whitson Court, Newport, Monmouthshire. Their existence is precarious, for they are not permitted to open a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Their days are spent in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, adoration, and the making of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">altar-breads</a>, vestments, and church ornaments. In March, 1911, the Sacramentines were permitted by Archbishop Farley to open a house in <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, Yonkers, New York.
