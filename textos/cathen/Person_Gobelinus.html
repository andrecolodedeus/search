<h1>Person Gobelinus</h1>  

<p>(Persona.)

<p>Born in 1358; died 17 November, 1421. He was a <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalian</a> and was known as an historian and an ardent reformer of monastic life in his native land. He received his first schooling at <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>. It may be that he came originally from this city; it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he was from the neighbourhood. As a young man he went to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where he studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and canon law, becoming cleric of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court, and later an official of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> exchequer. This was in 1384, under <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>, of whom he was ever a loyal adherent. This position ceased to be agreeable when the Great Schism came to disturb the Roman court. He resigned, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a> in 1386, and returned to his native land. Papal influence secured for him a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> from the church of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> and later the pastorate of St. Pancratius at <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>. He now attended the University of Erfurt, which he entered during the incumbency of its first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> (1392-1394). We glean from this that he was still pursuing his <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> studies. Wilhelm von Berg who had been chosen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> (1400-1415), selected Gobelinus for his court <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and induced him to enter his service. The latter availed himself of his position to labour for the further uplifting of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> and particularly for the restoration of discipline in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> which had drifted into an habitual disregard of their rules. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> at B&ouml;ddeken near <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> where the <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a> alone remained was changed into a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> for men and given over to the Augustinians. Not content with this, he undertook in spite of great difficulties to reform the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of Abdinghof, at <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>. But the opponents of his policy resisted it every way the interference of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who transferred to Bielefeld that branch of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> administration of which Gobelinus was a part. The latter had already in 1405 given up his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church at <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, owing to certam differences with the municipal authorities. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> appointed him dean of the collegiate church of Bielefeld. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, Dietrich von M&ouml;rs, who in 1415 received the <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">See of Paderborn</a> gave the dean authority to reform the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, not only in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Bielefeld but also in other institutions, a mission Gobelinus duly fulfilled.

<p>But old age and illness undermined the strength of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> divine. He resigned in 1418 and once more betook himself to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of B&ouml;ddeken. He did not don the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk's</a> habit, but spent the remaining years of his life in the quiet of monastic solitude.

<p>Gobelinus was also an historian. He wrote a history of the world entitled: "Cosmidromius, hoc est Chronicon universale complectens re ecclesiae et reipublicae". This work he brought down to the year 1418; from the year 1347 it is valuable as being an original source of information. The author accomplished his task with scrupulous care. The "Cosmidromius" was selected by Scheffer-Boichorst as his basis and starting-point when he set out to restore the "Annales Patherbrunnes", lost annals of the twelfth century which had been looked upon as an authority in its particular field. Another work of Gobelinus was his "Vita Meinulphi", a biography of Meinolf, a canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> in the first half of the ninth century, and the founder of the B&ouml;ddeken <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The Cosmidromius of Gobelinus was first published by Meibom (Frankfort, 1599) in the "Scritores rerum Germanicarum"; Max Jansen prepared a new edition (M&uuml;nster, 1900). The "Vita Meinulphi" may be found in the "Acta SS." of the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, Oct. III, 216 sqq.
