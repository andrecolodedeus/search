<h1>Perth</h1>  

<p>(PERTHENSIS)

<p>Located in Western Australia, suffragan to Adelaide; bounded on the north by parallel 31&ordm; 20' S. lat. (the Moore River), east to 120&ordm; E. long., and thence by parallel 29&ordm; S. lat. to the border of South Australia, its eastern boundary, on the south and west by the ocean. The first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> emigrants, settled about seventy-five years ago near the present city of Perth. As they had no <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/12201a.htm">Archbishop Polding</a> of <a href="../cathen/14365a.htm">Sydney</a> appointed Rev. John Brady his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> for the western portion of <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>. A native of Cavan, Father Brady had laboured for twelve years in Mauritius, before going to Australia in February, 1838. With Fr. John Joostens a former <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> in <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> forces, and Patrick O'Reilly, a catechist, he reached Albany, 4 November, 1843, and Perth, 13 December, 1843. Land for a church, presbytery, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was donated by Governor Hutt, and the foundation stone of the church laid, 27 December, 1843. Shortly afterwards Fr. Brady went to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to procure aid, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 18 May, 1845. He returned with some missionaries, including six <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> from Carlow, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, under Mother Ursula Frayne, reaching Fremantle in January, 1846.

<p>The early days of the mission were days of suffering and poverty. In 1848 the scattered <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population, which was extremely poor, numbered only 306 out of 4600 whites. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> soon sent Fr. Confalonieri with two catechists, James Fagan and Nicholas Hogan, to Port Essington to convert the native northern blacks. The catechists were drowned in a shipwreck on the voyage, but Fr. Confalonieri was spared to labour for two years, till his death by fever at <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a>, Melville Island, when he had converted over 400 blacks. An attempt to found a southern native mission failed for want of resources. A central mission was confided to two <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, Dom Serra and Dom Salvado. In March, 1847, they established a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, now <a href="../cathen/11005a.htm">New Norcia</a>, 84 miles from Perth. The first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod was held there, 13 March, 1848, attended by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and his three <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The mission sinking heavily in <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, Dom Salvado was sent to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> for funds. He returned January, 1849, but his resources were applied to <a href="../cathen/11005a.htm">New Norcia</a> alone. Dom Serra, who had also gone to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, had while there been made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12312b.htm">Port Victoria</a>. Worn out by toil and anxiety, Dr. Brady applied for a coadjutor, and Dom Serra was transferred from <a href="../cathen/12312b.htm">Port Victoria</a> to the titular See of <a href="../cathen/04638b.htm">Daulia</a> and appointed to administer the temporalities of Perth. He arrived there from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> with a large contingent of <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> in 1849. Dissension broke out between the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and Dr. Brady, unable to bear the strain, returned to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in 1852; he died in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 2 December, 1871. While he was in Perth, Dr. R. R. Madden, the historian, was appointed colonial secretary, the first <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> to hold that office in the colonies. On <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>, 10 June, 1854, the first two black children received <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> at Perth. In 1859 Fr. Martin Griver was made administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In 1862 Dom Serra returned to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where he died in 1886.

<p>On 10 October, 1869, Fr. Griver was named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Tloa and Administrator Apostolic of Perth. In July, 1873, he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Perth. In 1863 churches were erected at Fremantle, Guildford, and York. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of Perth, begun in that year, was dedicated on 29 January, 1865. In 1867 the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> established an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanage</a> at Perth. In 1882 the diocese contained 8500 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with 1300 children in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Bishop Griver died on 1 November, 1886. Born at Granollers in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. 11 November, 1810, he studied <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a>, but later joined the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and went out with Dom Serra in 1849. He laboured strenuously in building up the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and was a man of wonderful asceticism; after his death a wooden cross twelve inches long was found attached to his shoulders, fastened permanently into his flesh by five iron spikes. Dr. Matthew Gibney, who had been appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13648b.htm">Scythopolis</a> and Coadjutor of Perth <em>cum jure successionis</em>, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at Perth, 23 January, 1887. Under his guidance the diocese made rapid progress, as in his earlier days, so during his episcopate, he was an ardent apostle of religious <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for children. He introduced all the religious congregations mentioned below, except the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a>. In 1889, with two <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Vincentians</a>, he gave a mission throughout the whole of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In 1890 he set out for Beagle Bay, where he established a successful native mission, under the care of the <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a>, who were later replaced by the <a href="../cathen/12107a.htm">Pallotine Fathers</a> and the Sisters of <a href="../cathen/08472c.htm">St. John of God</a> from <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>, Perth. Owing to advanced years, Dr. Gibney resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> and has been succeeded by Most Reverend P. J. Clune, C.SS.R. (1911). Dr. Clune, born in Clare, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 1863, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06683a.htm">Diocese of Goulbourn</a> 24 June, 1886. In 1892 he returned to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and became a <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a>. After being stationed at Dundalk and Limerick, he was sent to <a href="../cathen/15580a.htm">Wellington</a>, <a href="../cathen/11040a.htm">New Zealand</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; after which he was superior at North Perth till his election as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. From the original Diocese of Perth, three additional <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> districts have been formed: <a href="../cathen/11005a.htm">New Norcia</a> (1847); the Vicariate Apostolic of Kimberley (1887); and the <a href="../cathen/06464c.htm">Diocese of Geraldton</a> (1898).
