<h1>Peter Abelard</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">Dialectician</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, born 1079; died 1142.

<p>Peter Abelard (also spelled Abeillard, Abailard, etc., while the best <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> have <em>Abaelardus</em>) was born in the little village of Pallet, about ten miles east of <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a> in Brittany.

<p>His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, Berengar, was lord of the village, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">mother's</a> name was Lucia; both afterwards entered the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> state. Peter, the oldest of their children, was intended for a military career, but, as he himself tells us, he abandoned Mars for Minerva, the profession of arms for that of learning. Accordingly, at an early age, he left his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> castle and sought instruction as a wandering scholar at the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the most renowned teachers of those days. Among these teachers was <a href="../cathen/13189c.htm">Roscelin</a> the <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalist</a>, at whose <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Locmenach, near <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a>, Abelard certainly spent some time before he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Although the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> did not exist as a corporate institution until more than half a century after Abelard's death, there flourished at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in his time the Cathedral School, the School of Ste. Genevi&egrave;ve, and that of St. Germain des Pr&eacute;, the forerunners of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the following century. The Cathedral School was undoubtedly the most important of these, and thither the young Abelard directed his steps in order to study <a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">dialectic</a> under the renowned master (<em>scholasticus</em>) <a href="../cathen/15632a.htm">William of Champeaux</a>.

<p>Soon, however, the youth from the province, for whom the prestige of a great name was far from awe-inspiring, not only ventured to object to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> master, but attempted to set up as a rival teacher. Finding that this was not an easy matter in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he established his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> first at Melun and later at Corbeil. This was, probably, in the year 1101. The next couple of years Abelard spent in his native place "almost cut off from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>", as he says. The reason of this enforced retreat from the <a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">dialectical</a> fray was failing health. On returning to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he became once more a pupil of <a href="../cathen/15632a.htm">William of Champeaux</a> for the purpose of studying rhetoric. When <a href="../cathen/15632a.htm">William</a> retired to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Victor, Abelard, who meantime had resumed his teaching at Melun, hastened to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to secure the chair of the Cathedral School. Having failed in this, he set up his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in Mt. Ste. Genevieve (1108). There and at the Cathedral School, in which in 1113 he finally succeeded in obtaining a chair, he enjoyed the greatest renown as a teacher of rhetoric and dialectic.

<p>Before taking up the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of teaching <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> at the Cathedral School, he went to Laon where he presented himself to the venerable <a href="../cathen/01550b.htm">Anselm of Laon</a> as a student of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Soon, however, his petulant restiveness under restraint once more asserted itself, and he was not content until he had as completely discomfited the teacher of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at Laon as he had successfully harassed the teacher of rhetoric and dialectic at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Taking Abelard's own account of the incident, it is impossible not to blame him for the temerity which made him such enemies as Alberic and Lotulph, pupils of Anselm, who, later on, appeared against Abelard. The "theological studies" pursued by Abelard at Laon were what we would nowadays call the study of <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>.

<p>There can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that Abelard's career as a teacher at <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">Paris</a>, from 1108 to 1118, was an exceptionally brilliant one. In his "Story of My Calamities" (<em>Historia Calamitatum</em>) he tells us how pupils flocked to him from every country in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, a statement which is more than corroborated by the authority of his contemporaries. He was, in fact, the idol of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; eloquent, vivacious, handsome, possessed of an unusually rich voice, full of confidence in his own power to please, he had, as he tells us, the whole world at his feet.

<p>That Abelard was unduly conscious of these advantages is admitted by his most ardent admirers; indeed, in the "Story of My Calamities," he confesses that at that period of his life he was filled with vanity and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. To these faults he attributes his downfall, which was as swift and tragic as was everything, seemingly, in his meteoric career. He tells us in graphic language the tale which has become part of the classic literature of the love-theme, how he fell in love with Heloise, niece of Canon Fulbert; he spares us none of the details of the story, recounts all the circumstances of its tragic ending, the brutal vengeance of the <a href="../cathen/03252a.htm">Canon</a>, the flight of Heloise to Pallet, where their son, whom he named Astrolabius, was born, the secret wedding, the retirement of Heloise to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunnery</a> of Argenteuil, and his abandonment of his academic career. He was at the time a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> in <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, and had naturally looked forward to a distinguished career as an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> teacher.

<p>After his downfall, he retired to the <a href="../cathen/13343b.htm">Abbey of St. Denis</a>, and, Heloise having taken the veil at Argenteuil, he assumed the habit of a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at the royal <a href="../cathen/13343b.htm">Abbey of St. Denis</a>. He who had considered himself "the only surviving <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> in the whole world" was willing to hide himself &#151; definitely, as he thought &#151; in <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> solitude. But whatever dreams he may have had of final peace in his monastic retreat were soon shattered. He quarrelled with the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/13343b.htm">St. Denis</a>, the occasion being his irreverent criticism of the legend of their <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a>, and was sent to a branch institution, a <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> or <em>cella</em>, where, once more, he soon attracted unfavourable attention by the spirit of the teaching which he gave in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>.

<p>"More subtle and more learned than ever", as a contemporary (<a href="../cathen/11358b.htm">Otto of Freising</a>) describes him, he took up the former quarrel with Anselm's pupils. Through their influence, his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, especially on the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">doctrine of the Holy Trinity</a>, was impeached, and he was summoned to appear before a council at <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, in 1121, presided over by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, Kuno, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Praneste. While it is not easy to determine exactly what took place at the Council, it is clear that there was no formal condemnation of Abelard's doctrines, but that he was nevertheless condemned to recite the <a href="../cathen/02033b.htm">Athanasian Creed</a>, and to burn his book on the Trinity. Besides, he was <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentenced</a> to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> in the Abbey of St. M&eacute;dard, at the instance apparently, of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/13343b.htm">St. Denis</a>, whose enmity, especially that of their Abbot Adam, was unrelenting. In his <a href="../cathen/04755a.htm">despair</a>, he fled to a <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert place</a> in the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>. Thither pupils soon began to flock, huts and tents for their reception were built, and an <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratory</a> erected, under the title "The Paraclete", and there his former success as a teacher was renewed.

<p>After the death of Adam, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Denis, his successor, <a href="../cathen/14326a.htm">Suger</a>, <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolved</a> Abelard from <a href="../cathen/03527a.htm">censure</a>, and thus restored him to his rank as a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">Abbey</a> of St. Gildas de Rhuys, near <a href="../cathen/15271b.htm">Vannes</a>, on the coast of Brittany, having lost its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> in 1125, elected Abelard to fill his place. At the same time, the community of Argenteuil was dispersed, and Heloise gladly accepted the <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">Oratory</a> of the Paraclete, where she became <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">Abbess</a>.

<p>As <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Gildas, Abelard had, according to his own account, a very troublesome time. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, considering him too strict, endeavoured in various ways to rid themselves of his rule, and even attempted to poison him. They finally drove him from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Retaining the title of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a>, he resided for some time in the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a> and later (probably in 1136) resumed his career as teacher at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and revived, to some extent, the renown of the days when, twenty years earlier, he gathered "all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>" to hear his lectures. Among his pupils at this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> were <a href="../cathen/01747b.htm">Arnold of Brescia</a> and <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a>.

<p>Now begins the last act in the tragedy of Abelard's life, in which <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> plays a conspicuous part. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a>, the most powerful man in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in those days, was alarmed at the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heterodoxy</a> of Abelard's teaching, and questioned the Trinitarian <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> contained in Abelard's writings. There were admonitions on the one side and defiances on the other; St. Bernard, having first warned Abelard in private, proceeded to <a href="../cathen/04733b.htm">denounce</a> him to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; Abelard, underestimating the ability and influence of his adversary, requested a meeting, or council, of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, before whom Bernard and he should discuss the points in dispute.

<p>Accordingly, a council was held at <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> (the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> to which <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> was then suffragan) in 1141. On the eve of the council a meeting of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was held, at which Bernard was present, but not Abelard, and in that meeting a number of propositions were selected from Abelard's writings, and condemned. When, on the following morning, these propositions were read in solemn council, Abelard, informed, so it seems, of the proceedings of the evening before, refused to defend himself, declaring that he <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appealed</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Accordingly, the propositions were condemned, but Abelard was allowed his freedom. St. Bernard now wrote to the members of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, with the result that Abelard had proceeded only as far as <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluny</a> on his way to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> when the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> confirming the <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a> of the Council of Sens reached him.



<p>The <a href="../cathen/10525b.htm">Venerable Peter of Cluny</a> now took up his case, obtained from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a mitigation of the <a href="../cathen/13720b.htm">sentence</a>, reconciled him with St. Bernard, and gave him honourable and friendly <a href="../cathen/07475c.htm">hospitality</a> at Cluny. There Abelard spent the last years of his life, and there at last he found the peace which he had elsewhere sought in vain. He donned the habit of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Cluny and became a teacher in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. He died at Chal&ocirc;n-sur-Sa&ocirc;ne in 1142, and was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> at the Paraclete. In 1817 his remains and those of Heloise were transferred to the <a href="../cathen/03504a.htm">cemetery</a> of P&egrave;re la Chaise, in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where they now rest.

<p>For our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the life of Abelard we rely chiefly on the "Story of My Calamities", an autobiography written as a letter to a friend, and evidently intended for publication. To this may be added the letters of Abelard and Heloise, which were also intended for circulation among Abelard's friends. The "Story" was written about the year 1130, and the letters during the following five or six years. In both the personal element must of course, be taken into account. Besides these we have very scanty material; a letter from <a href="../cathen/13189c.htm">Roscelin</a> to Abelard, a letter of Fulco of Deuil, the chronicle of <a href="../cathen/11358b.htm">Otto of Freising</a>, the letters of St. Bernard, and a few allusions in the writings of <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a>.

<p>Abelard's <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> works are "Dialectica," a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> treatise consisting of four books (of which the first is missing); "Liber Divisionum et Definitionum" (edited by Cousin as a fifth book of the "Dialectica"); <a href="../cathen/06588a.htm">Glosses</a> on Porphyry, Bo&euml;ius, and the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelian</a> "Categories"; "Glossulae in Porphyrium" (hitherto unpublished except in a French paraphrase by R&eacute;musat); the fragment "De Generibus et Speciebus", ascribed to Abelard by Cousin; a <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> treatise "Scito Teipsum, seu Ethica", first published by <a href="../cathen/11785b.htm">Pez</a> in "Thes. Anecd. Noviss". All of these, with the exception of the "Glossulae" and the "Ethica", are to be found in Cousin's "Ouvrages in&eacute;dits d'Ab&eacute;lard" (Paris, 1836).

<p>Abelard's <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> works (published by Cousin, "Petri Abselardi Opera", in 2 vols., Paris, 1849-59, also by <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, "Patr. Lat.", CLXXVIII) include "Sic et Non", consisting of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">scriptural</a> and <a href="../cathen/11560a.htm">patristic</a> passages arranged <em>for</em> and <em>against</em> various <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> opinions, without any attempt to decide whether the affirmative or the negative opinion is correct or <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>; "Tractatus de Unitate et Trinitate Divin&acirc;", which was condemned at the Council of Sens (discovered and edited by St&ouml;lzle, Freiburg, 1891); "Theologia Christiana," a second and enlarged edition of the "Tractatus" (first published by Durand and <a href="../cathen/09721a.htm">Mart&egrave;ne</a> "Thes. Nov., " 1717); "Introductio in Theologiam" (more correctly, "Theologia"), of which the first part was published by Duchesne in 1616; "Dialogus inter Philosophum, Judaeum, et Christianum"; "Sententiae Petri Abaelardi", otherwise called "Epitomi Theologiae Christianae", which is seemingly a compilation by Abelard's pupils (first published by Rheinwald, Berlin, 1535); and several <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> works <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, <a href="../cathen/12481d.htm">sequences</a>, etc.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> Abelard deserves consideration primarily as a dialectician. For him, as for all the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> before the thirteenth century, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> inquiry meant almost exclusively the discussion and elucidation of the problems suggested by the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> treatises of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> and the commentaries thereon, chiefly the commentaries of Porphyry and Bo&euml;tius. Perhaps his most important contribution to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> is the method which he developed in his "Sic et Non" (Yea and Nay), a method germinally contained in the teaching of his predecessors, and afterwards brought to more definite form by <a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a> and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>. It consisted in placing before the student the reasons <em>pro</em> and <em>contra</em>, on the principle that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is to be attained only by a dialectical discussion of apparently contradictory arguments and authorities.

<p>In the problem of <a href="../cathen/15182a.htm">Universals</a>, which occupied so much of the attention of dialecticians in those days, Abelard took a position of uncompromising hostility to the crude <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">nominalism</a> of <a href="../cathen/13189c.htm">Roscelin</a> on the one side, and to the exaggerated <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">realism</a> of <a href="../cathen/15632a.htm">William of Champeaux</a> on the other. What, precisely, was his own <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on the question is a matter which cannot with accuracy be determined. However, from the statements of his pupil, <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a>, it is clear that Abelard's doctrine, while expressed in terms of a modified <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a>, was very similar to the moderate <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Realism</a> which began to be official in the <a href="../cathen/13548b.htm">schools</a> about half a century after Abelard's death.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethics</a> Abelard laid such great stress on the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> as apparently to do away with the objective distinction between <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> acts. It is not the physical action itself, he said, nor any imaginary <em>injury</em> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that constitutes <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but rather the <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> element in the action, the <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a>, which is formal contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>With regard to the relation between <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> and <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revelation</a>, between the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> &#151; including <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> &#151; and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, Abelard incurred in his own day the censure of <a href="../cathen/14621a.htm">mystic theologians</a> like St. Bernard, whose tendency was to disinherit <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in favour of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> and <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstatic vision</a>. And it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that if the principles "Reason aids <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>" and "Faith aids <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">Reason</a>" are to be taken as the inspiration of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic theology</a>, Abelard was constitutionally inclined to emphasize the former, and not lay stress on the latter. Besides, he adopted a tone, and employed a phraseology, when speaking of sacred subjects, which gave offence, and rightly, to the more conservative of his contemporaries. Still, Abelard had good precedent for his use of <a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">dialectic</a> in the elucidation of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; he was by no means an innovator in this respect; and though the thirteenth century, the golden age of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholasticism</a>, knew little of Abelard, it took up his method, and with fearlessness equal to his, though without any of his flippancy or irreverence, gave full scope to <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> in the effort to expound and defend the mysteries of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>.

<p>St. Bernard sums up the charges against Abelard when he writes (Ep. cxcii) "Cum de Trinitate loquitur, sapit Arium; cum do grati&acirc;, sapit Pelagium; cum de person&acirc; Christi, sapit Nestorium", and there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that on these several heads Abelard wrote and said many things which were open to objection from the point of view of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. That is to say, while combating the opposite <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, he fell inadvertently into mistakes which he himself did not recognize as <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>, and which even his enemies could characterize merely as savouring of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>. Abelard's influence on his immediate successors was not very great, owing partly to his conflict with the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>, and partly to his personal defects, more especially his vanity and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, which must have given the impression that he valued <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> less than victory.

<p>His influence on the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the thirteenth century was, however, very great. It was exercised chiefly through <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, his pupil, and other framers of the "Sentences." Indeed, while one must be careful to discount the exaggerated encomiums of Compayr&eacute;, Cousin, and others, who represent Abelard as the first modern, the founder of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, etc., one is justified in regarding him, in spite of his faults of <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> and mistakes of judgment, as an important contributor to <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">scholastic</a> method, an enlightened opponent of obscurantism, and a continuator of that revival of learning which occurred in the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carolingian</a> age, and of which whatever there is of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, literature, and speculation in the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> is the historical development.
