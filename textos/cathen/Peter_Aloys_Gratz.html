<h1>Peter Aloys Gratz</h1>  

<p>Schoolmaster and <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a>, b. 17 Aug., 1769, at Mittelberg, Allg&auml;u, <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>; d. at Darmstadt, 1 Nov., 1849; received his elementary training in the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at F&uuml;ssen, studied classics in <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, and in 1788 entered the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/04795a.htm">Dillingen</a>, to take up the study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. His student years were characterized by deep <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and an intense <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of study. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, in 1792, he held the office of private tutor, and in 1796 was placed in charge of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church of Unterthalheim, near Horb, on the Rhine. In spite of his manifold <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> he found time to prepare several textbooks and other small works on <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian instruction</a>, for use in elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Besides, being of a literary turn of mind and urged, no doubt, by the spirit of the age, he at the same time turned his attention to other occupations, choosing for his special field of labour <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a>. In 1812 he published "Neuer Versuch, die Entstehung der drei ersten Evangelien zu erkl&auml;ren" (Stuttgart, 1812), in which he adopted the hypothesis of a Hebrew original as the basis of one of the <a href="../cathen/14389b.htm">synoptic Gospels</a>. The learning and critical skill exhibited in this work attracted the attention of scholars, and won for him on 28 September of the same year the chairs of Greek language and Biblical <a href="../cathen/07271a.htm">hermeneutics</a> in the University of <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a>. Recognizing his abilities and future usefulness, the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a>, in 1813, conferred on him the doctorate in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>.

<p>During his professoriate in <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a> he published: (1) "Kritische Untersuchungen &uuml;ber Justins apostolische Denkw&uuml;rdigkeiten" (Stuttgart, 1814); (2) "&Uuml;ber die Interpolationen in dem Briefe des Apostels Paulus an die R&ouml;mer" (Ellwangen, 1814); (3) "&Uuml;ber die Grenzen der Freiheit, die einem Katholiken in der Erkl&auml;rung der Schrift zusteht," (Ellwangen, 1817); (4) "Dissertatio in Pastorem Herm&aelig;", in "Constanzer Archiv", 1817, II, 224 sqq. On the amalgamation of the University of <a href="../cathen/05392c.htm">Ellwangen</a> with that of T&uuml;bingen, in 1817, he accompanied the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty thither, and continued his lectures on <a href="../cathen/07271a.htm">hermeneutics</a>. Here he published his "Kritische Untersuchungen uber Marcions Evangelium" (T&uuml;bingen, 1818), and with the cooperation of his friends Drey, <a href="../cathen/07251a.htm">Herbst</a>, and Hirscher, founded in 1819 the T&uuml;bingen "Theologische Quartalschrift", a publication which from its inception has enjoyed an uninterrupted existence.

<p>The same year he received an invitation to the chair of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> in the newly erected faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">University of Bonn</a>. His reputation attended him here, and he lectured with great success. This, however, was of short duration. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, though now free from the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> and <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">Febronianism</a> which characterized the first period of its existence, was gradually undergoing the influence of a new movement known as Hermesianism, the originator of which was <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">Georg Hermes</a>, professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and an intimate friend of Gratz. The high reputation of <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">Hermes</a>, the popular character of his lectures, as well as the fact that they were devoted to the examination of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> systems of <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a> and Fichte, induced Gratz to sympathize with his distinguished friend and associate himself with the new movement. The step was a fatal one. He regretted it deeply and desired to abandon his position in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. All efforts to this effect failed, however, and at the instance of his more trustworthy friends he continued to lecture at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a> till 1823. He remained a member of its <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty till 1826, and in 1828 was called to <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, there to become a member of the municipal council and also of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> board. His success in this new field of activity was remarkable. He devoted all his time and energy to the reorganization of the studies, and to placing the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> generally on a higher scale of efficiency than they had hitherto attained. While in Bonn he published: (1) "Apologet des Katholicismus, Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Freunde der Wahrheit und der Bruderliebe" (Mainz, 1820-24, 9 fasc.); (2) "Novum Testamentum gr&aelig;co-latinum" (T&uuml;bingen, 1820; Mainz, 1827); and (8) "Kritischer Commentar &uuml;ber das Evangelium des Matth&auml;us" (T&uuml;bingen, 1821-23). This commentary, owing to the extensive use the author made of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> works, was severely attacked by <a href="../cathen/02570c.htm">Binterim</a> and G&ouml;rres. Gratz replied in the sixth fascicle of his "Apologeten", while his friends published in his defence "Drei &ouml;ffentliche Stimmen gegen die Angriffe des Pastors Binterim auf den Commentar des Professors Gratz, nebst drei Beilagen" (Bonn, 1825). He also undertook the continuation of the "Thesaurus juris ecclesiastici" of Aug. Schmidt, S.J., which, however, remained unfinished.
