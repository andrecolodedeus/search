<h1>Peter Cantor</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a>, b. probably at Gisberoi near <a href="../cathen/02377c.htm">Beauvais</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; d. at Long Pont Abbey, 22 Sept., 1197. He was a member of the Hosdenc <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; when still young he went to <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, which may possibly have been his birthplace, and was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. He was a professor for many years, canon of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and would seem to have had also the office of cantor or succentor.

<p>Towards 1170, we find Peter as canon and professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where in 1180 he is again invested with the office of cantor, for his predecessor appears on the documents for the last time in 1180, whilst mention is first made of him in 1184. This is what <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be designated Petrus Cantor, Cantor Parisiensis, or simply Cantor; and his name is found on many charters. At the same time, his capabilities led him to be frequently chosen by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> as a judge, e.g., at Troys in 1188, and also during 1196 and 1197 at Compi&eacute;gne for the royal <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> case with Ingeberge. In 1191 the people and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/14798a.htm">Tournai</a> chose him for their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but his election was annulled by Bishop Guillaume de Champagne of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. At the death of <a href="../cathen/14329c.htm">Maurice de Sully</a> in 1196, it is said that he was elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, but refused the dignity.

<p>In 1196 Peter was elected dean of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. Whilst on his journey from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, Peter visited the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> at Long Pont Abbey, was taken ill there, died, and was buried, probably wearing the habit of order. In the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10191b.htm">menology</a> he is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as one of themselves (19 May).

<p>He left commentaries of glosses on all the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> Books, except Judith, Esther, Tobias, and Leviticus; the best are those on the Psalms. In like manner he also wrote glosses on the whole of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, following the Harmony of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a> which, under the name of Ammonius, or <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, was much in use during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. His commentaries on the Gospels and on the Apocalypse are perhaps the most worthy of praise; that on <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> may be described as an interlinear gloss; in it scholastic discussions are often introduced <em>&agrave; propos</em> of certain subjects as they are suggested by the text. This style of writing commentaries was by no means new to the age in which he lived, and it is more and more developed at this period. None of these works were printed, not even an introduction or treatise which he wrote on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> in twenty folio pages variously entitled: "De tropis theologicis", "De contrarietate scriptur&aelig;", or "De tropis loquendi"; in it he lays down rules for the solution of contradictions that may seem to exist between different passages of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. Traces on it may be found in Peter's commentaries and annotations on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>; the rules of <a href="../cathen/14721d.htm">Ticonius</a> are sometimes found following on the "De tropis" of Peter.

<p>There are two other unpublished works, namely, the "Summa de sacramentis et anim&aelig; consiliis", which though lengthy is nevertheless precious for its varied information on the institutions and religious customs of the time; he develops at great length the moral side of the question, especially when writing on the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>. He purposely leaves aside matters already discussed by <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, for as he himself says it is his intention to complete them. The "Distinctiones" or "Summa qu&aelig; dicitur Abel" is a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> dictionary arranged in alphabetical order, "Abel" being the first word, in which is found a short r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, doctrines, and theories of the time; with this as title, he wrote a valuable document which is still to be found in many <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> (Paris, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, etc.). Pitra has published portions of it ("Spicilegium Solesmense", III, I, 308; "Analecta Sacra," II, 6-154, 585-628).

<p>The "Verbum Abbreviatum", his only work that was entirely printed, with the "Contra Monachos proprietarios" which in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> forms the matter of chapter cliii and written before 1187, is not a course of ethics or asceticism, but a book addressed chiefly to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and more in particular to <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, wherein he exhorts to the practice of virtue; his sources are the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, the writings of the Fathers, and profane authors. What he says about manners, customs, etc., is very instructive for the time in which he wrote. As in the "Summa de Sacramentis", so here are found scholastic theories side by side with practical remarks on daily life from a religious point of view (1st ed., Mons, 1639; <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., CCV 23). Some sermons are also ascribed to Peter, but only those which are in the form of detached chapters of the "Verbum abbreviatum" are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.
