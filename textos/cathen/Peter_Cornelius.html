<h1>Peter Cornelius</h1>  

<p>Later when ennobled, <font size=-2>VON</font> C<font size=-2>ORNELIUS</font>

<p>Born at D&uuml;sseldorf, 23 September, 1783; died at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 6 March, 1867. In 1811 he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he stayed until 1819. Returning home he became director of the Academy of Fine Arts at D&uuml;sseldorf; while at D&uuml;sseldorf he also executed works on a large scale for the Crown-Prince of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, later Louis I. In 1825 Cornelius was appointed director of the Academy at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, and for a long time Louis I of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> was his liberal patron. After fifteen years, however, misunderstandings and the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of <a href="../cathen/04757a.htm">detractors</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> Cornelius to accept the position offered him by Frederick IV of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> as director of the Academy of Fine Arts at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, which office he retained until his death. Cornelius early developed poetic <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, great energy, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> for large undertakings, and technical skill. He felt himself called to accomplish great tasks, and soon occupied himself with a large theme, the illustration of Goethe's "Faust". The publication of the first six sheets furnished Cornelius with the means for his first visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Here he joined the Italian colony of German artists, the so-called "Nazarene painters", and was powerfully stimulated both by working with them and by their enthusiasm for a new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of German-Christian art. This intercourse, however, entailed no loss of his independence and native force. He drew the remaining six pictures for "Faust", illustrated the "Romeo and Juliet" of <a href="../cathen/13748c.htm">Shakespeare</a>, whose works just at this period were becoming better known in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and filled by the rising national spirit of his country made drawings for the old German epic, the "Niebelungenlied".

<p>While at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> his longing to express great conceptions in fresco-painting on a large scale had its first opportunity of fulfilment. The <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> ambassador, Bartholdy, gave a commission to the German <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> for the decoration of his house on Monte Pincio with frescoes from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old-Testament</a> story of Joseph; through Bartholdy's influence the same <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> received an order from the Marchese Massimi to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> frescoes from the works of <a href="../cathen/01712b.htm">Ariosto</a>, <a href="../cathen/14463d.htm">Tasso</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> in his villa near the Lateran. Some of these frescoes have a deservedly high reputation, as: "Joseph before Pharao", "Joseph and his Brethren", "Dante before Peter, James, and John", as well as other groups in the cartoons for scenes in <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a>. Three of the <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> cartoons were completed, but one of them has since vanished. The superiority of Cornelius to the entire circle of his artist-friends, <a href="../cathen/11362a.htm">Overbeck</a> included, became so clear to men like Niebuhr and Prince Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> that the two positions above-mentioned, at D&uuml;sseldorf and <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, were offered him. No longer hampered by material cares or artistic limitations, Cornelius had now full opportunity and a fine field for the carrying out of his ideals. A commanding place in the artistic world of his own country was a long time assured him, and the attainment of his hopes for the development of art on a heroic scale in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> seemed near. The first ten years of his life in D&uuml;sseldorf and <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> as a professor and working artist formed a period of great renown and success.

<p>As director Cornelius took up with vigour the reorganization of the art academies of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> and D&uuml;sseldorf, but his influence in the latter city was not permanent. After he had made <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> his permanent residence and most of his friends had followed him there, the academy at D&uuml;sseldorf, under the direction of <a href="../cathen/13518a.htm">Schadow</a>, pursued other aims, one of the main differences being that the scheme of developing <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in fresco on a heroic scale was abandoned. At the same time Cornelius did not find at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> all the assistants he had wished; above all <a href="../cathen/11362a.htm">Overbeck</a> had not followed him. Besides this the pupils did not meet the great problems of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in fresco with skill equal to his; he was also not able to obtain in every case competent teachers for the theoretical instruction in the subsidiary <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> which at that time he held to be absolutely essential. Moreover, the favour of the king was too extreme to be permanent, nor could it fail to arouse <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. After 1820 Cornelius and his pupils decorated two halls and an entrance chamber of the Glyptothek at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, a building intended for the exhibition of ancient <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>. The subjects were, for the two halls, the gods and heroes of classic antiquity and, for the entrance chamber, the history of primitive man, the compositions being based on Greek mythology. The selection gave the artist the opportunity of presenting beautiful forms, strong action, and lofty ideals; at the same time he could make use of symbolical allusions as they are conceived by <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>.

<p>Cornelius has been called a poet and thinker; the loftiness and unity of conception displayed by these frescoes justify the assertion. The mastery of the difficult proportion of space shown is astonishing; the surfaces seem to have been planned for the frescoes and not the frescoes for the spaces. On the other hand, the inequality of execution especially in regard to colour is very striking. Cornelius allowed great liberty to his unequally gifted pupils; still much of the work, especially what he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> himself, is excellently carried out, as: "The Fall of Troy", "The Judges of the Lower World", "Eros with an Eagle", and "Eros with Cerberus". It must be acknowledged that Cornelius was not strong in colour, although his frescoes from the life of Joseph in the Villa Bartholdy are in all particulars satisfactory. King Louis I allowed him to make only the drawings for the loggias of the Pinakothek; the execution of the work was entrusted to Clemens Zimmermann. In these designs Cornelius gave in an unconstrained manner, yet one full of thought and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, the history of German and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. He hoped to have an opportunity in the new church, the "Ludwigskirche", to create a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> epic which should be a Divine Comedy in colour, but to his bitter disappointment he was only commissioned to decorate the choir and <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>. The subject chosen for delineation was the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> conception of the Creation, Redemption, and the Last Judgment; the gigantic fresco of the Judgment, containing 2500 square feet, was <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> by Cornelius himself (1836-39). Parts of the fresco show great merit in composition and drawing; a reverent composure and the avoidance of repellent nudity distinguish the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> from <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo's</a> "Judgment" on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel. The colour scheme, it must be acknowledged, is somewhat lacking in harmony, and the light in the church is unfavourable. King Louis saw the fresco under peculiarly unfortunate circumstances, and Cornelius fell into disgrace.

<p>In 1841 he went to Berlin where the art-loving Frederick William IV became his unwavering patron. While at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> he drew for the royal mausoleum planned by the king the celebrated cartoons: "Christ Conquering Sin", intended for the east wall of a <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> designed in connexion with a new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; "Christ Conquering Death", for the west wall of the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>; "Christ in His Church", for the south wall, and "Christ at the End of the World", taken from the imagery of the Apocalypse, for the north wall. In harmony with the scheme of the cartoons is the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> for the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of the intended <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, "Mankind Awaiting the Day of Judgment", completed by Cornelius in 1856. During his residence at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> Cornelius produced his most mature work as a draughtsman; his designs were at all times so complete that they were not certain to gain by execution in colour. The cartoons for the royal mausoleum, of which the one for the north wall was on the scale of the intended fresco, met fairly undisputed approval. His work as head of the German School at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and as leader in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> of aspiring artists gives Cornelius the position of a pioneer of the nineteenth century in asserting high ideals and in developing technic on the heroic scale.
