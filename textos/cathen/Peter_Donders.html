<h1>Peter Donders</h1>  

<p>Missionary among the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, b. at Tilburg in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, 27 Oct., 1807; d. 14 Jan., 1887. He desired from his early childhood to be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but he had to begin life as a worker in a factory. He afterwards became a servant in a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> where he learned a little and made great progress in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Later a benefactor enabled him to pursue his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies in the College of Herlaar. A chance reading of the "Annals of the Propagation of the Faith" determined his vocation for foreign missions. He was accepted in 1839 for <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Guiana as a missionary, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> the following year, and in 1842 arrived at Paramaribo to begin his long apostolic career. He laboured with success among the blacks in the plantations, and by 1850 had instructed and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> 1200. In the epidemic of 1851 his labours were superhuman, till, like his fellow-priests, he too became a victim. Before he was convalescent he not only resumed his work among the blacks, but extended it to the Indians of Saramaca. In 1855 he took up his residence in Batavia where for nearly thirty-two years he ministered to 600 <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>. He left them only to visit the blacks and Indians. In 1865 the whole colony was confided to the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist Fathers</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the King of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. Father Donders at once asked to be of their number and was received in Paramaribo, in 1867, by Monsignor Swinkels, the first <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>. After this he went back to his charge. He studied music to cheer his afflicted children, and though given an assistant he laboured to the end. The process for his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> has been placed before the Congregation of Sacred Rites.
