<h1>Peter Gandolphy</h1>  

<p>(Or Gandolphi.)

<p><a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> preacher; b. in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 26 July, 1779; d. at East Sheen, Surrey, 9 July, 1821; son of John Vincent Gandolphi of East Sheen, and grandson of Count Pietro Gandolphi, of the ancient nobility of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. Father Gandolphy's brother, John Vincent, married Teresa, eldest daughter of Thomas Hornyold, of Blackmore and Hanley. His only son succeeded to the Blackmore estates and assumed the name of Hornyold by Royal license in 1859. Hornyold was an ancient <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in Worcestershire, and Blackmore Park (recent pulled down) was a fine example of an old English manor house, with numerous priests' hiding places. The present representative of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, Alphonso Otto Gandolfi Hornyold, bears the title of Duke Gandolfi (a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> creation of 1899) as well as the old <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> titles.

<p>Father Gandolphi was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, and also at <a href="../cathen/14309b.htm">Stonyhurst</a>, where he was appointed as teacher of humanities in 1801. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> about 1804, and his first charge was at Newport, Isle of Wight. He was then transferred to the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a> Square, <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (now known as St. James's, Spanish Place) where he soon attained great fame as a preacher; and as a worker among <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> he made many converts. His methods, however, were somewhat infelicitous, and speedily incurred the censure of his ordinary, Bishop Poynter. It appears he wrote too speedily to be theologically exact, but there were certainly no <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> principles in his mind. Nevertheless it seems strange to read of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> manual entitled the "Book of Common Prayer . . . . for the use of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the United Kingdom" which he brought out in 1812. On account of this, and of his "Sermons in defense of the Ancient Faith", Bishop Popynter felt it his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to suspend him, and to denounce the offending works. Gandolphy went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in person to defend himself, and in 1816 he obtained official <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> for the two censured works from S. P. Damiani, master of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and Apostolic pentitentiary at St. Peter's, and F.J. O'Finan, <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of St. Sixtus and St. Clement. The <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a>, being anxious for a peaceable settlement of this unfortunate affair, required (1 March, 1817) that Gandolphy should be restored on his apologizing to Bishop Poynter for any unintentional disrespect which might have occurred in his address to the public, of which address also the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had complained. On 15 April Gandolphi accordingly wrote an apology, but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in a pastoral letter on 24 April stated that the apology was inadequate, so at last on 8 July, Gandolphy made an unreserved apology; but this long drawn out public humiliation was too much for him. He resigned his post in 1818 and retired to his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> home at East Sheen, where he died in a year or two. His principal works were: "A Defense of the Ancient Faith" (London, 1813-14); "Liturgy, or a Book of Common Prayer, and Administration of Sacraments, with other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church. For the use of all Christians in the United Kingdom" (London, 1812, Birmingham, 1815); "Lessons of Morality and Piety, extracted from the Sapiential Books" (London, 1822); and a number of controversial letters and sermons.
