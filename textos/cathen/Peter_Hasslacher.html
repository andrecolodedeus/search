<h1>Peter Hasslacher</h1>  

<p>Preacher; b. at Coblenz, 14 August, 1810; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 5 July, 1876. He was one of that band of missionaries from the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> whose fruitful labours throughout <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, from <a href="../cathen/06264a.htm">Freiburg</a> to Berlin and Danzig, reawakened and strengthened the country's <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> forces after the stormy year of 1846. Hasslacher's youth was somewhat tempestuous. As a medical student in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in Bonn, in 1831, he identified himself with the German student movement, which was looked upon as revolutionary; and he was compelled, in consequence, to undergo seven years confinement at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, and Ehrenbreitstein. During these years he underwent a spiritual change, and in particular, by studying the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>, stirred his mind with <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; after his liberation he entered, in the spring of 1840, the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, at St.-Acheul, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, on 1 Sept., 1844, and then preached with much success in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, until the year 1849. It was at this time that the popular missions were inaugurated in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; but Hasslacher's delicate health could not long withstand the physical exertions entailed; and this apparent difficulty and disadvantage led the zealous-heated missionary into the field of activity which was particularly his own, namely, the conference. This he himself explains in a detailed letter (Deutsches Ordensarchiv) written from Bad Ems to his provincial in 1860. He gave conferences in all the larger cities in the Rhine and <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>. His strength failing, he was sent in 1863 to conduct, in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, the St. Joseph's Mission for German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; but even this labour became after ten years too much of a tax on his physical powers so that he was compelled to abandon it and to take up similar but lighter <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>. After a year he was brought back, very ill, to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he died.
