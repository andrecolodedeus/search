<h1>Peter Hubert Evermode Backx</h1>  

<p>Born 10 December, 1805, at Tilburg, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>; died 28 October, 1868. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 17 March, 1832, he may be considered the second founder of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> Abbey of Tongerloo (Province of <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>), which was established in 1128, or eight years after the foundation of the Pr&aelig;monstratensian Order by St. Norbert. It had to suffer much from the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> during the second half of the sixteenth century, but the fatal blow was struck by the French Republic, which, on 6 December, 1796, expelled the religious, confiscated the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and sold it to the highest bidder. At that time Tongerloo was at the height of its prosperity. After the <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Jesuits</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and community of Tongerloo had made all arrangements for the continuation of the "Acta Sanctorum" and the "Analecta Belgica" of the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, and four of its canons were co-operating with two of the former <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> in this gigantic publication. The catalogue of the Abbey of Tongerloo, made in 1796, gives the names of one hundred and nineteen <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and professed scholastics and of six <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>. A large number of these lived in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, others were attached to <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> belonging to it. Some were completing their <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> or at the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, one was President of St. Norbert's College in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, another was president of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of the same name at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>. Under the French Republic and again, after the battle of Waterloo, during the reign of William I, King of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, the expelled and dispersed religious were not allowed to form a new community, but better times came with the creation of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> as a separate kingdom, in 1830. Only sixteen of the one hundred and twenty-five religious were living at that time and nearly all were well advanced in years. The castle of Halmale near Antwerp was rented, and the first <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a>, Peter Hubert Backx, received the white habit and with it the name in religion of Evermode. Three more young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and others who had finished their classical studies followed his example. In 1839 Evermode Backx was chosen superior of the revived community.

<p>At the death of one of the proprietors one-half of the dilapidated Abbey of Tongerloo was bought at a public auction and Abbot Backx led, amidst the rejoicings of the villagers, the young community to Tongerloo, 1 July, 1840. That very afternoon, the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> was resumed with the first <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15480a.htm">Feast of Our Lady's Visitation</a>. On the following day, the venerable Chrysostom Raemakers, who had celebrated the last Mass on the day of the suppression, 6 December, 1796, sang a solemn Mass in one of the rooms improvised as a temporary oratory, the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> church and other buildings having been pulled down.

<p>Evermode Backx's first work was to repair what was left of the former <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and to erect new buildings for the growing community. In 1849 the second part of the confiscated <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was bought and in 1852 the first stone of a large church was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> laid by the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a>, so that the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> began to have the appearance of a large and well-ordered <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. After a strenuous government of twenty-eight years Evermode Backx died, regretted by his spiritual children. The work was carried on with equal <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> by his successors, the Right Rev. Abbot Chrysostom De Swert (d. 1887) who sent some of his religious to found the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> of Crowle and Spalding, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; the Right Rev. Thomas Heylen, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, the founder of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> Priory, <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Norbertine</a> missions in the Independent State of Congo, Africa; and the Right Rev. Adrian Deckers, formerly <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">Prefect Apostolic</a> in the Congo. The catalogue of the Abbey of Tongerloo for 1907 gives the names of 78 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 8 professed scholastics, 4 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, and 23 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, or a total of 113 religious, several of whom are engaged in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work, 14 working in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and 16 in the Congo missions.
