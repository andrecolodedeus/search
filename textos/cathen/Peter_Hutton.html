<h1>Peter Hutton</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Priest</a>, b. at Holbeck, <a href="../cathen/09112a.htm">Leeds</a>, Yorkshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 29 June, 1811; d. at Ratcliffe, Leicestershire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 2 Sept., 1880. He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at Lady Lane Chapel, then the only <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in <a href="../cathen/09112a.htm">Leeds</a>. His grandfather was a convert and wished Peter's father to be a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, but he found that he had no vocation, so returned to a secular life and married. In his will he requested that his son Peter should be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> college, and Peter was accordingly sent to Ampleforth in 1824, and began his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in 1829. But owing to certain provisions of the Catholic Emancipation Act of that year, his superiors were, at least theoretically, debarred from professing <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> and, as they were unwilling to offend the authorities in any way, Peter was not professed. So in 1830 he went to Prior Park, where he taught classics. In 1835 the members of the Institute of Charity came to assist in the teaching, and Dr. Gentili shortly afterwards succeeded to the presidency of the college. Hutton was at this time a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, having been so for over five years; and he disliked the advent of these foreign professors very much. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> then sent him to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> in 1836, where he studied till be was recalled to Prior Park in 1839 by <a href="../cathen/02207d.htm">Bishop Baines</a> to replace Father Furlong (who had just joined the Order of Charity) as President of St. Peter's College. Hutton was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 24 September, 1839, and appointed president, and professor of Latin and Greek.

<p>In 1841 he decided to give up his professorial career in order to enter the Order of Charity. In July, he was admitted to its <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at Loughborough, Leicestershire; but <a href="../cathen/02207d.htm">Bishop Baines</a> strongly objected to this, deposed him from the presidency of St. Peter's, and ordered him to return to Prior Park as an ordinary professor. For a short period he complied with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> commands, but in 1843 he suddenly left college, in company with Father Furlong, and went to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where then were hospitably received by <a href="../cathen/13194b.htm">Rosmini</a>, the founder of the Institute of Charity. He completed his interrupted <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> there, and made his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> 31 July, 1843. In 1844 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the new college of the order at Ratcliffe-on-Wreake, Leicestershire. He next did some <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> work at Newport, Monmouthshire, and Whitwick, near Leicester. He then went to Shepshed, Leicestershire, as <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the mission and master of the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of Ratcliffe, which had been removed thither. In 1850 it was again transferred to Ratcliffe, and Hutton was then made vice-president of the college, and president in 1851. In addition to this he was appointed <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community in 1857.

<p>Hutton was a strict disciplinarian, a sound <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and classical scholar, a good mathematician, an able preacher. During his administration, the students at Ratcliffe increased in numbers, and the buildings were greatly enlarged. He left in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> translations of the principal Greek and Latin authors read at Ratcliffe, with copious notes, and many references to German critics. These are preserved at Ratcliffe.
