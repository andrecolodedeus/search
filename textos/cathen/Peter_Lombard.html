<h1>Peter Lombard</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, b. at Waterford, about 1555; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1625; belonged to a respectable and wealthy <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. More than one of his relatives filled the position of mayor of Waterford, and others gained eminence in literature, among the latter being the famous <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Luke Wadding</a>. After receiving his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at Waterford, young Lombard was sent to Westminster School, whence, after some years, he went to Oxford. At Westminster School one of his professors was the historian Camden, and pupil and master seem to have got on well together. Camden's learning was great and Lombard was studious and clever and earned the praises of his master for his gentleness and docility. Camden also takes credit for having made his pupil a good <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. But the change. if it occurred at all, did not last, and Lombard, after leaving Oxford, went to <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, passed through his philosophic and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> classes with great distinction, graduated as Doctor of Divinity, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Appointed professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> University he soon attracted notice by the extent of his learning. In 1594 he was made <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>. When he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, a few years later, <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> thought so highly of his learning and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> that he appointed him, in 1601, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>. He also appointed him his domestic <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, and thus secured him an income, which in the condition of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> at the time, there was no hope of getting from Armagh.

<p>Henceforth till his death Lombard lived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was for a time president of the <a href="../cathen/04238a.htm">"Congregatio de Auxiliis"</a> charged with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of pronouncing on Molina's work and settling the <a href="../cathen/06710a.htm">controversy on predestination and grace</a> which followed its publication (Schuceman, "Controversiarum de divin&aelig; grati&aelig; liberique arbitrii concordia initia et progressos", Freiburg, 1881). Lombard was active and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in providing for the wants of the exiled Earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnel, and was among those who publicly welcomed them to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was not however able to go to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a> were in force, and to set foot in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> would be to invite the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of O'Devanny and others. This would certainly have been Lombard's fate, for James I personally disliked him and publicly attacked him in the English Parliament. Armagh was thus left without an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> for nearly a quarter of a century. There was however an administrator in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the well-known <a href="../cathen/13207a.htm">David Rothe</a>. He had for a time acted at Borne as Lombard's secretary and the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of Armagh. Nor did <a href="../cathen/13207a.htm">Rothe</a> cease to act in this capacity even after 1618, when he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11342b.htm">Ossory</a>. The Northerns bitterly complained of being left so long without an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. In any case they disliked being ruled by a Munsterman, still more being ruled by one unwilling to face the dangers of his position. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Lombard wrote "De Regno Hiberni&aelig; sanctorum insula commentarius" (Louvain 1632: re-edited, Dublin, 1868 with prefatory memoir, by Bishop, now <a href="../cathen/14366a.htm">Cardinal Moran</a>). This work gave such offence to Charles I that he gave special directions to his <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> viceroy, Strafford, to have it suppressed. Lombard also wrote a little work on the administration of the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>, and in 1604 a yet unedited work, addressed to James I, in favour of religious liberty for the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> (Bellesheim, "Gesch de Kath. Kirche in Irland", II (Mainz, 1890), 323-25, and <em>passim</em>.
