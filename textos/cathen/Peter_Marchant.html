<h1>Peter Marchant</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. at Couvin, a village in the principality of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, in 1585; d. at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a>, 11 Nov., 1661. His brother James was the author of the well-known work "Hortus Pastorum". Peter entered the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> in 1601. He led an austere life and was a strict observer of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Rule. He acquired a profound <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and for several years taught in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of his order. In 1625 he was elected definitor general of the order at the general chapter held in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; and in 1639 was appointed commissary general over the provinces of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">Great Britain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. His <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as commissary general brought him into contact with <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> politics during the troublesome times of the "Confederation of Kilkenny". Unfortunately he allowed himself to be deceived by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> reports on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> state of affairs in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and he took sides with the Ormondists and gave encouragement to their opposition to the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> Rinaccini. He was called upon by the authorities of the order to justify his conduct in connection with the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> question, and in 1661 he addressed to the general chapter then assembled in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> his <em>apologia</em> under the title of "Relatio veridica et sincera status Provinciae Hiberniae", etc. This is a very rare book, as it was never widely circulated and was condemned by the general chapter and ordered to be destroyed.

<p>Marchant was a voluminous author. His chief work is "Tribunal Sacramentale" (3 vols., Ghent, 1642; Antwerp, 1672), for the use of confessors. It contains a full exposition of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>. He puts aside all disputed opinions, and simply states the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> teaching of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, drawing his <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, the decisions of councils, the constant tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the writings of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. The treatise on Probabllism is lucid and complete. Its principles are in accordance with the restrictions plated on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> later on by the decrees of <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> and <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>; and in many points is identical with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> subsequently propounded by Daniel in his refutation of the "Lettres Provinciales". Marchant wrote several works on the cultus of St. Joseph. His work instituted "Sanctificatio S. Joseph Sponsi Virginis in utero asserta" (Bruges, s.d.), was placed on the <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">Index</a>, 19 March, 1633. He also wrote "Baculus Pastoralis sive Potestas Episcoporum in Regulares exemptos ab originibus suis explicata" (Bruges, 1638); "Resolutiones notabiles variorum casuum et quaestionum a multis hactenus desideratae" (Antwerp, 1655). Many of his works are on the history and legislation of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>.
