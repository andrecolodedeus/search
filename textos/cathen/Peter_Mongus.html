<h1>Peter Mongus</h1>  

<p>(<em>moggos</em>, "stammerer", or "hoarse".)

<p>Intruded <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> patriarch of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> (d. 490). Under Timothy Ailuros, who was made patriarch by the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> after Chalcedon (454-460), Peter Mongus was an ardent adherent of that party. As Timothy's <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> he took part in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a>. Timothy Ailuros was expelled from the patriarchal throne in 460 and the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Timothy Salophakiolos was set up by the government instead (460-75). In 475 another revolution recalled Ailuros, who held his place till death (477). His party thereupon elected Peter Mongus to succeed him. The Emperor Zeno (474-91) sentenced Mongus to death; he escaped by flight. Meanwhile Salophakiolos returned and reigned till his death (481). The <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a> chose John Talaia to succeed (481-82; see <a href="../cathen/08485c.htm">JOHN TALAIA</a>). Peter Mongus, always claiming to be patriarch, now comes forward again. John had quarrelled with Acacius, patriarch of Constantinople, and refused to sign Zeno's <a href="../cathen/07218b.htm">Henoticon</a> (482); so he was expelled, the emperor changed his attitude, and supported Mongus (482). Talaia fled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Mongus took possession of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and sent notice of his succession to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and Constantinople. He had signed the <a href="../cathen/07218b.htm">Henoticon</a> and was therefore inserted in Acacius's <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> as <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (<a href="../cathen/06030b.htm">Felix II or III</a>, 483-92) defended Talaia's <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in two letters to Acacius.

<p>From this time Mongus became the chief champion of all <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>. He held a synod to condemn Chalcedon, and <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Proterios and Salophakiolos, his <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> predecessors. He was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> repeatedly by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. It was communion with Mongus and the acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/07218b.htm">Henoticon</a> that caused the <a href="../cathen/01082a.htm">Acacian</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Constantinople (484-519). When Acacius died and was succeeded by Flavitas (or Fravitas, 489-90) Mongus wrote to the new patriarch again condemning Chalcedon and encouraging him in his <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He died in 490 and was succeeded by another <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a>, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> II (490-96). For a long time after his death the name of Peter Mongus was still a party word. To read it in the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> (of the dead) was a kind of profession of Monophystism; the first condition of reunion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world generally was to erase it, with that of <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscurus</a> and the other great champions of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. In the line of Alexandrine <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> Mongus is counted as Peter III. He is said to have written many books, of which however nothing remains. A pretended correspondence between him and Acacius (in Coptic) is proved to be spurious by Amelineau in the "M&eacute;moires publi&eacute;s par les membres de la mission arch&eacute;ologique fran&ccedil;aise au Caire", IV (Paris, 1888), 196-228.
