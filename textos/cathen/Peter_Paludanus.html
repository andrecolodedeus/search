<h1>Peter Paludanus</h1>  

<p>(PETRUS DE PALUDE)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, born in the County of Bresse, <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, about 1275; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1342. He entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, completed his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, and was made a Doctor and Master of Theology in 1314. Wishing to devoted his life to teaching and writing, he avoided all offices of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in the order, except those pertaining to the direction of studies. Twice, however, he was sent as definitor from the Province of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to the General Chapter. <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, wishing to organize a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a>, sent him in 1318 as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to the Court of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, in the hope of establishing peace between the prince and the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The mission was not successful, and his associates made charges to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> against the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, who, however, easily cleared himself. He was also a member of the commission appointed by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> to examine the writings of Petrus Olivi, whose books contained some <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the Fraticelli (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, 484-91, interesting account in <a href="../cathen/15001b.htm">Touron</a>). About this time he wrote "De causa immediata ecclesiastic&aelig; potestatis" (Paris, 1506) against John of Poilly, whose <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> were condemned 25 July, 1321 (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, 491, 495). In 1329 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> called him to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. The same year he journeyed into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, to negotiate with the sultan for the deliverance of the Holy Land. The sultan was immovable. The accounts which the patriarch gave of the miserable condition of the Holy Land led to the announcement of another <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a>, but owing to apathy, and dissensions among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes, the project failed. Peter resumed his studies, composing at this time his commentaries on the Sentences of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, in which he combats Durandus. About 1332 he was appointed by the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to preside over the deliberations of a body of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> whom Philip had convoked at <a href="../cathen/15366a.htm">Versailles</a> to discuss the charge made against <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, of asserting that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just will not be admitted to the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a> until after the general judgment. The patriarch and his associates manifested consummate <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in dealing with this matter. In a letter to the king they declared;

<ul><li>(1) their entire submission to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> authority, and their filial devotion to his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; <li>(2) their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, based on the testimony of trustworthy witnesses, that <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> had not held, much less taught, the opinion attributed to him, but at the most, had mentioned it (<em>recitando</em>) and examined it; <li>(3) that since the death of Christ the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just with no faults to expiate immediately after death, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of other just <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> after complete <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgation</a>, are admitted to the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision</a>, which will endure forever.</ul>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was defined by <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a>, 29 Jan., 1336 (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, 530). Besides the works mentioned, Paludanus wrote commentaries on all the books of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, and "Concordanti&aelig; ad Summam S. Thom&aelig;" (Salamanca, 1552).
