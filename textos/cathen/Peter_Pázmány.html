<h1>Peter P&aacute;zm&aacute;ny</h1>  

<p>A famous Hungarian ecclesiastic of the seventeenth century; died 19 March, 1637. He was born of noble blood. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>; his stepmother, who was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, turned the boy's spirit towards the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. After making his elementary studies in Nagyv&aacute;rad, where two <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> exercised great influence over him, he went to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in Kolozsv&auml;r. At the age of thirteen he <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and at seventeen entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. Proceeding to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for his higher studies, he studied for four years under <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>. Afterwards he taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in Gratz, and in 1601 returned to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. He successively became Provost of Tur&oacute;c, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nyitra, in 1616 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Esztergom, and lastly <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of all <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. P&aacute;zm&aacute;ny engaged in a literary <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> with Stephen Magyary, a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> preacher, who in a book entitled "The causes of the country's ruin" (Az orsz&aacute;gokban val&oacute; sok roml&aacute;soknak okair&oacute;l), published in 1602, declared the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion to be the principal cause. P&aacute;zm&aacute;ny answered him in a work entitled "Reply to Stephen Magyary" (Felelet Magyary Istv&aacute;nnak), proving that the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant religion</a>, and not the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, was the cause. He translated the <a href="../cathen/07674c.htm">"Imitation of Christ"</a> and also compiled a <a href="../cathen/12350a.htm">prayer-book</a>, still in popular use. In 1605 appeared "Ten arguments proving the falsity of the present science"; in 1609, "Five famous letters to Peter Alvinczy"; in 1613 his great <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and apologetical work, "Hodoegus, or Guide to God's truths" (Hodoegus, vagy Isteni igazs&aacute;gra vez&eacute;rl&ouml;, Kalauz). The first part of the last work was dogmatic, the second part polemical. With unanswerable arguments he showed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, whose victory in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> he secured by this work. Henceforth <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> was reduced to personal recriminations and force of arms. In 1636 he published his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>, which became a model for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.

<p>P&aacute;zm&aacute;ny belongs to the first rank of preachers, his discourses being notable for their <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, rather than beautiful words. By his writings, preaching, but especially by his personal meetings he converted about thirty noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> (e.g. the Zrinyi, Wessel&eacute;nyi, N&aacute;dasdy, R&aacute;k&oacute;czy etc.). These <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> spent most of their money in converting the people of the lower classes, whom the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> had seduced from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith. As <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, P&aacute;zm&aacute;ny put into effect the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. He introduced the Missale Romanum, and was the great apostle of the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy of the clergy</a>. He also displayed great activity in founding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, building many <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of poor students who aspired to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and also many elementary and high schools. In 1623 he gave 46,000 dollars toward the building in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> of a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for Hungarians (the <em>Pazmaneum</em>), which is today in a very flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. In 1626 he built a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in Pozsony, the direction of which he placed in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. In 1635 he built an elementary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in the same place, and in 1627 he gave 533 dollars that <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungarian</a> seminarians might be sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to finish their <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies. In Nagyszombat he built a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and also a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for the children of impoverished nobles. In 1635 he founded the first Hungarian <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> for the furthering of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ideals; this institution is in Budapest, and is at present (1910) attended by 5000 students. P&aacute;zm&aacute;ny ordered that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> every year, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> every four years, should hold a conference, and that the deans and <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> should take an examination every year. As a politician, P&aacute;zm&aacute;ny desired <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> to be a kingdom with a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> ruler, and that <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> should work together in all dealings with foreign powers, <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> being independent. P&aacute;zm&aacute;ny's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was that, with a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Hungarian king, the country would be well protected from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. It was to his earnest efforts that Ferdinand II was partially endebted for his succession to the throne. In 1622 he brought about peace between Gabriel Bethlen (ruler of <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a>) and Ferdinand II, religious freedom being granted to the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. He battled so long and nobly for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, and his efforts were <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> with such great success that we may say that he was born in <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, but died in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>.
