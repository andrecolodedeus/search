<h1>Peter Roh</h1>  

<p>Born at Conthey (Gunthis) in the canton of Valais (<a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>), 14 August, 1811; d. at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a>, 17 May, 1872. Up to his thirteenth year he spoke only French, so that he had to learn German from a German <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the vicinity before he was able to begin his gymnasial studies in the boarding-school kept by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at Brig in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. Later he became a day-pupil at the <em>gymnasium</em> kept by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at Sittin. While here he resolved to enter the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> (1829); strange to say the external means of bringing him to this decision was the reading of <a href="../cathen/11511a.htm">Pascal's</a> pamphlet "Monita Secreta". He taught the lower gymnasial classes at the lyceum at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>. During these years of study Roh showed two characteristic qualities: the talent of imparting <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in a clear and convincing manner, and an unusual gift for oratory. These abilities determined his future work to be that of a teacher and a preacher. He was first (1842-5) professor of dogmatics at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a>, then at the academy at <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a> which had just been given to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. At the same time he preached and aided as opportunity occurred in missions. These labors were interrupted by the breaking out of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Sonderbund, during which he was military <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>; but after its unfortunate end he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee into <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, from there to Linz and Gries, finally finding a safe refuge at Rappoltsweiler in Alsace as tutor in the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of his countryman and friend Siegwart-M&uuml;ller, also expatriated. Here he stayed until 1849. A professorship of dogmatics at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> only lasted a year. When the missions for the common people were opened in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 1850 his real labors began; as he said himself, "Praise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I now come into my element." Both friend and foe acknowledge that the success of these missions was largely due to Roh, and his powerful and homely eloquence received the highest praise. He was an extemporaneous speaker; the writing of sermons and addresses was, as he himself confessed, "simply impossible" to him; yet, thoroughly trained in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, he could also write when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, as several articles from him in the "Stimmen aus Maria-Laach" prove. His pamphlet "Das alte Lied: der Zweck heiligt die Mittel, im Texte verbessert und auf neue Melodie gesetzt" has preserved a certain reputation until the present day, as Father Roh declared he would give a thousand gulden to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who could show to the faculty of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of Bonn or Heidelberg a book written by a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> which taught the principle that the end justifies the means. The prize is still unclaimed. Some of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> have also been preserved; they were printed against his will from stenographic notes. Father Roh's greatest strength lay in his power of speech and "he was the most powerful and effective preacher of the German tongue that the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> have had in this century".
