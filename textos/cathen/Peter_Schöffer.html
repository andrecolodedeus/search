<h1>Peter Sch&ouml;ffer</h1>  

<p>Publisher and printer, b. at Gernsheim on the Rine about 1425; d. at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in 1503. As a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> in <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> he was in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1451 working as a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> copyist. In 1455 he appeared as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> for <a href="../cathen/06326b.htm">Johannes Fust</a> against <a href="../cathen/07090a.htm">Gutenberg</a>. Later he married <a href="../cathen/06326b.htm">Fust's</a> daughter, Christine, and he was a partner of <a href="../cathen/06326b.htm">Fust</a> in the publishing business until 1456, from that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> up to 1503 printing independently. Sch&ouml;ffer may have become an experienced printer as an assistant of <a href="../cathen/06326b.htm">Fust</a> and perhaps of <a href="../cathen/07090a.htm">Gutenberg</a>, but he had no share whatever either in the invention or in the improvement of typography, as has been claimed for him and his descendants; this is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, notwithstanding the splendid impressions of the <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalters</a> bearing his name and published in 1457 and 1459, the technical preparation of which has been ascribed to <a href="../cathen/07090a.htm">Gutenberg</a>. The evident deterioration of books issued at the end of the century <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a> that Sch&ouml;ffer made no technical improvement in the art of printing. The work of Sch&ouml;ffer's press shows all the technical excellence of his predecessors, but no advance. He did much for the development of the art of printing by establishing commercial relations beyond the borders of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. But the management of his press was always conservative, and he published almost exclusively works on <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, canon law, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. He neither made improvements nor did he adopt the improvements of his contemporaries, such as reducing the size of his books, issuing popular books, etc. At the time of Sch&ouml;ffer's death many printers of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> had long surpassed both his publications and his press. Sch&ouml;ffer's son John carried on the business, 1503-31. The son was a capable printer and exerted himself to improve the work produced by his press, but was unable to place himself in the front rank of printers of the time. A second son of Sch&ouml;ffer's, Peter the younger, was a capable die-cutter and printer, and engaged in his trade at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, 1509-23; at Worms, 1512-29; at <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, 1530-39; at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1541-42. His son Ivo took up his quarters at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, 1531-55, and there carried on the printing business of his grandfather.
