<h1>Peter Skarga</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologian</a> and missionary, b. at Grojec, 1536; d. at <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a>, 27 Sept., 1612. He began his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in his native town in 1552; he went to study in <a href="../cathen/04464c.htm">Cracow</a> and afterwards in <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>. In 1557 he was in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> as tutor to the young Castellan, Teczynski; returning thence in 1564, he received <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, and later was <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nominated</a> canon of <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a>. Here he began to preach his famous sermons, and to convert <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. In 1568 he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> and went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he became penitentiary for the Polish language at St. Peter's. Returning to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, he worked in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> of Pultusk and Wilna, where he converted a multitude of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> being at the time prevalent in those parts. To this end he first published some works of controversy; and in 1576, in order to convince the numerous schismatics in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, he issued his great treatise "On the Unity of the Church of God", which did much good then, and is even now held in great esteem. It powerfully promoted the cause of the Union. King Stephen B&aacute;thori prized Skarga greatly, often profited by his aid and advice, took him on one of his expeditions, and made him <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the Academy of Wilna, founded in 1578. In 1584 he was sent to Cracow as superior, and founded there the Brotherhood of Mercy and the "Mons pietatis", meanwhile effecting numerous conversions. He was appointed court preacher by Sigismund III in 1588, and for twenty-four years filled this post to the great advantage of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the nation. In 1596 the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Church was united with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, largely through his efforts. When the nobles, headed by Zebrzydowski, revolted against Sigismund III, Skarga was sent on a mission of conciliation to the rebels, which, however, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> fruitless. Besides the controversial works mentioned, Skarga published a "History of the Church", and "Lives of the Saints" (Wilna, 1579; 25th ed., Lemberg, 1883-84), possibly the most widely read book in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. But most important of all are his "Sermons for Sundays and Holidays" (Cracow, 1595) and "Sermons on the Seven Sacraments" (Cracow, 1600), which, besides their glowing eloquence, are profound and instructive. In addition to these are "Sermons on Various Occasions" and the "Sermons Preached to the Diet". These last for inspiration and feeling are the finest productions in the literature of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> before the Partitions. Nowhere are there found such style, eloquence, and patriotism, with the deepest religious conviction. Skarga occupies a high place in the literature and the history of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>. His efforts to convert <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, to restore schismatics to unity, to prevent corruption, and to stem the tide of public and political license, tending even then towards <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>, were indeed as to this last point unsuccessful; but that was the nation's fault, not his.
