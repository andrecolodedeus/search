<h1>Peter Talbot</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, 1669-1680; b. at Malahide, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, in 1620.

<p>At an early age he entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, where he pursued his sacred studies with great distinction. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and subsequently for some years held the chair of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> of <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>. Meantime, through the Cromwellian usurpation, Charles II and the royal family were compelled to seek a refuge first in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and then at Cologne. Throughout the whole period of the king's exile, the four brothers of Dr. Talbot were attached to the royal Court. The eldest brother, Sir Robert Talbot, had held a high commission under Lord Ormond in the army in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> during the Federation period, and was now reckoned among the king's most confidential advisers. A younger brother, Colonel Richard Talbot, was also remarkable for his devotedness to the cause of the exiled monarch and stood high in royal favour. Under James II he became Duke of Tyronnell and Lord-Lieutenant of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>.

<p>Dr. Talbot himself was constantly in attendance on the king, and his Court. On account of his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the continental languages he was repeatedly dispatched on private embassies to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and in all of them gave abundant <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of ability and fidelity to the royal cause. It appears unquestionable that during his exile in <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, Charles II received instruction in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and was privately received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by Dr. Talbot. It used to be said of the king by his friends that whenever he was in a serious mood he was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, but when he was in a merry mood he bade adieu to all religion. Unfortunately this second mood generally prevailed, especially after the Restoration, and this explains why he needed to be again received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on his death-bed by <a href="../cathen/07511a.htm">Father Hudlestone, O.S.B.</a>

<p>On the return of the king to <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, Dr. Talbot received an appointment as Queen's Almoner, but the Clarendon and Ormond faction, that was then predominant, feared his influence with the king. A plot was devised against him. He was even accused of conspiring with the aid of four <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to assassinate the Duke of Ormond, and so fierce was the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> stirred up against him that he was forced to seek safety by resigning his position at Court and retiring to the Continent. The king allowed him a pension of three hundred pounds a year.

<p>Before his return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> Dr. Talbot had, with the approval of the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, dissevered his connexion with the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. He was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> on 11 January, 1669, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, assisted by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> and <a href="../cathen/06045a.htm">Ferns</a>. It was a propitious <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> for appointments to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. Lord Ormond was no longer in favour and was soon after removed from the Viceroyalty, and those who succeeded him were supposed not to be so hostile to the religious interests of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; they were even said to have received instructions from the king to be lenient in their dealings with his <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> subjects, and to show special favour to Dr. Talbot.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> entered with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> on the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and was untiring in his efforts to promote the interests of his long <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> flock. In the month of August, 1670, he held his first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>. It was a memorable event that gave <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body. It was opened with High Mass, which for forty years many of the faithful had not <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witnessed</a>. To add to the <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, rich <a href="../cathen/05400a.htm">embroidery</a> and other ornaments were sent from the viceregal castle to adorn the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>. One of the abuses that called for remedy tells of the difficulties that pressed upon the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of those days in their endeavour to meet the wants of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. On week days they had been accustomed to <a href="../cathen/02568b.htm">duplicate</a>, whilst on Sundays they had to celebrate <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">holy Mass</a> three times.

<p>In the same year an assembly of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and representatives of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was held in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, having for its main purpose the consideration of a form of Declaration of Allegiance which was drawn up by <a href="../cathen/15541a.htm">Father Peter Walsh</a> and his associate Remonstrants, and which was urged on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for general acceptance by the Ormondist party, the better to sow dissensions among the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The assembled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> rejected the proposed form of allegiance, but, to <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that this was not done through any lack of loyalty, they drew up another Declaration expressive of their due allegiance, but omitting some phrases offensive to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> that had been cunningly inserted in the rejected Declaration. A fierce discussion was in consequence raised by the Remonstrants backed by the Ormondists, that distracted the country for several years.

<p>At this assembly the question of precedence and of the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> authority gave rise to considerable discussion and led to an embittered controversy between the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> and <a href="../cathen/12169b.htm">Ven. Oliver Plunkett</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>. Both <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> considered that they were asserting the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of their respective <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>, and each published a learned treatise on the subject. Whilst this controversy lasted Dr. Talbot wrote some severe censures regarding the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, but when in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in later years, he addressed to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, then a brother <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, an ample apology asking his forgiveness for the harsh things that had been formerly written, and the <a href="../cathen/12169b.htm">Ven. Oliver Plunkett</a>, as we will just now see, showed in a most practical manner how sincerely and affectionately he was reconciled to his former opponent.

<p>Another meeting of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> gentry, convened by Dr. Talbot, at which it was resolved to send to the Court at <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> a representative who would seek redress for some of the grievances to which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> were subjected, gave great alarm to the Cromwellian settlers and to the Ormondists. It was an attempt, they said, to reverse the <a href="../cathen/01112a.htm">Act of Settlement</a> and to foster a fresh rebellion. An address from Parliament was presented to the king <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> that by royal edict all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and in particular "Peter Talbot, pretended <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>", be banished from the kingdom, and further "that all <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, and popish public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> be suppressed; that no <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> papist be admitted to inhabit in any <a href="../cathen/04387a.htm">corporation</a> of that kingdom; that all the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Papists might be disarmed, and no Papist be either continued or admitted to be a commander or soldier in that Kingdom".

<p>The king <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> full well how groundless and absurd were the pretences for such a royal edict, but he was too weak to offer any resistance, and thus, in 1673, a fierce storm of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was let loose against the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and Dr. Talbot was compelled to seek safety in exile. During his banishment he resided generally in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; but by pastoral letters and written instructions he contined to do all that was in his power to guide and comfort his flock. In 1675 Dr. Talbot, worn out with infirmities, obtained permission to return to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> only, and for two years he resided with a family friend at Poole Hall in Cheshire.

<p>Towards the close of 1677, he petitioned the Crown for leave "to come to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to die in his own country", and through the influence of the Duke of York his petition was granted. Just then the "Popish Plot" was being organized by Lord Shaftesbury and <a href="../cathen/11173c.htm">Titus Oates</a>, and very soon information was forwarded to the Lord-Lieutenant, the Duke of Ormond, to the effect that a rebellion was being planned in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, that Peter Talbot, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, was one of the <a href="../cathen/01100a.htm">accomplices</a>, and that assassins were hired to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> the duke himself. Ormond replied that he had no apprehension whatever on these heads, and that as regards Peter Talbot there could be no foundation for them, as he was in a dying state. Nevertheless as it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to give some colour to the existence of such a plot, on 8 October, 1678, he signed a warrant for the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop's</a> arrest, and he writes on the same day to the Council in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>:

<blockquote><p>"I have sent a squadron of his Majesty's guard of horse to apprehend Peter Talbot, the Titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>". He was arrested at Cartown near Maynooth at the house of his brother, Colonel Richard Talbot, and, as Carte attests, was removed to <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> "in a chair, and committed close <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> to the Castle with a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to attend him in his miserable and helpless condition, the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of his distemper being scarce supportable and threatening his death at every moment. For two years Dr. Talbot endured with heroic constancy all the sufferings of his painful disease and the hardships and filth of his loathsome dungeon. He died in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> in the beginning of November, 1680.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ormond, in a postscript to a letter of 20 Nov., 1680, addressed to Lord Sutherland, writes: "I have for two or three posts forgot to acquaint your Lordship that Peter Talbot, the Titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, is dead, and that care was taken to have the body looked upon by some that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him." It is the tradition that he was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the churchyard of St. Andeon's, close by Lord Portlester's <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. From his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> cell Dr. Talbot had written on 12 April, 1679, petitioning that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> be allowed to visit him, as he was bedridden "these six months past" and was now in imminent danger of death. The petition was refused, but the <a href="../cathen/12169b.htm">Venerable Oliver Plunkett</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, was a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in an adjoining cell, and on hearing of Dr. Talbot's dying condition forced his way through the warders and administered to the dying <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> the last consolations of religion. Dr. Talbot may justly be styled a <a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">confessor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> and a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.
<h2>Writings</h2>

<p>Dr. Talbot, whilst living on the Continent, published several works, as well before his appointment to the See of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, as during his years of exile. His principal writings are: "A Treatise on the Nature of Catholic Faith and Heresy with Reflexions upon the Nullity of the English Protestant Church and Clergy" (8 vols., Rouen, 1657); "The Politician's Catechism", by N. N., printed at Antworp (sic) in the year 1658; "The Nullity of the Prelatique Clergy" (Brussels, 1659); "The Duty and Comfort of Suffering Subjects" (a pastoral letter to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>), Paris, 1674; "Blackloan&aelig; H&aelig;resis, Historia et Confutatio, Auctore M. Lomino Theologo, Gandavi anno 1675" (mainly directed against Dr. Sargent; in the appendix is inserted a letter of the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> of 26 July, 1676, congratulating Dr. Talbot on his excellent work and intimating that Sargent had retracted his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> propositions); "Primatus Dublinensis, vel summa rationum quibus innititur ecclesia Dublinensis in possessione et prosecutione sui juris ad primatum Hyberni&aelig;. Insulis, Ex Officina Nicolai de Rache, sub Bibliis aureis, 1674" (an exceedingly rare work; there is a copy in the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the College of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the inscription, "Ex libris Jacobi Eustachii, Dublinensis, 1683").
