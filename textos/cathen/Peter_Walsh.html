<h1>Peter Walsh</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, born at Mooretown, County Kildare, about 1608; died in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, 15 March, 1688. Educated and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in the celebrated <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a> of St. Anthony at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, he was later appointed to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of his order at Kilkenny, where he warmly supported the Ormondist party in the confederation then assembled in that city. He was made guardian by the triumphant Ormondists in 1648; took a leading part in the agitation against the validity of the censures fulminated by the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, <a href="../cathen/13061a.htm">Rinuccini</a>; acted as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to the Munster army till its final defeat by the Parliamentary forces; led a precarious existence in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and on the Continent till 1660 when the Restoration saw him back in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and high in the favour of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> genius of the Confederates, the all-powerful Ormonde. He was appointed their accredited <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> agent by the few surviving <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in 1661. He introduced and tried to have accepted by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people the famous "Remonstrance" which distracted the country for the next half-dozen years; took a prominent part in a meeting of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> which, with Ormonde's consent, he had assembled in Dublin in June, 1666, to discuss the Remonstrance; but despite all his efforts he was unable to induce or force the meeting to sign a document which the great majority regarded as disrespectful to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, if not actually in conflict with <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> on the supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Breaking definitively with the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>, he put himself at the head of a party consisting of a few of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and several <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, who were known as the Valesians and Valesian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and who were a source of considerable anxiety to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for some time; but the fall of Ormonde in 1669 deprived them of their mainstay, and they declined so rapidly that <a href="../cathen/12169b.htm">Oliver Plunket</a>, writing to <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> in 1671, was able to report that hardly a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Valesian remained. Walsh, however, for whom Ormonde's influence had secured the seneschalship of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a> (worth about &#163;100 a year) from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that see, held out almost to the end. Though the General Chapter of his order held at Valladolid in 1670 pronounced sentence of major <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against him, he disregarded the penalty, and it was only a few days before his death that he was induced to make his peace with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>He left many writings behind him. Of these, with the exception of a worthless history of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> down to the English invasion, entitled "A Prospect of the State of Ireland", nearly all are concerned with the question of the Remonstrance, and comprise his "More Ample Account" (1662); "Irish Colours Folded" (1662); "Controversial Letters" (1673); "Letter to Catholics" (1674); "History of the Irish Remonstrance" (1674); and a long defence of his attitude addressed to the general of his order in a Latin publication entitled "Causa Valesiana" (1684), all of which were published in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. His "History of the Remonstrance" is valuable for the light it throws on the events of that distracted time.
