<h1>Peter de Blois</h1>  

<p>A statesman and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a> about 1130; died about 1203. He appears to have first studied at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, and was, perhaps, the disciple of Jean de Salisbury, who taught in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> from 1140 to 1150; he studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in Bologna, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he taught the liberal arts. In 1167 Count Stephen du Perche brought him to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> (1167). Here he became preceptor of the king, guardian of the royal seal, and one of the queen's principal counsellors. But the favouritism shown the foreigner excited the jealousy of the nobles and he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> (1169). After several years in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, he went to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he became one of Henry II's diplomatic agents and was charged with negotiations with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1176 he became chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Bath. He became entangled in the disputes between the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and, in this connexion, was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1177, and to <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> in 1187, on diplomatic missions to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. After the death of Henry II (1189), he fell into disgrace, and he speaks in his letters of <a href="../cathen/13041b.htm">Richard the Lion Hearted</a> as the "new <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>". He entered the service of Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, to whom he was secretary (1190-95), and was made <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>. But his revenue from this <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> scarcely sufficed for his living and he wrote to <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> to this effect in one of the last letters (1198) he has left us. His material status was hardly in keeping with the great authority he exercised in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> towards the end of the reign of Henry II, in affairs of the State, or of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Not only was he the king's chief counsellor, but many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> consulted him and obtained his advice on important matters regarding their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>.

<p>He wrote numerous letters, models of his epoch, but full of the bad taste of the twelfth century. He wrote also numerous treatises. He continued the "History of the Monastery of Croyland of Ingulf" (901 to 1135). Unfortunately, the "History of Henry II" has been lost (De rebus gestis Henrici II). His other writings are sermons, commentaries on the Scripture, moral and ascetic treatises, in which he attacks with blunt frankness the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> of the English and Aquitainian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (treatise entitled, "Quales sunt"). In 1189, after the taking of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> by Saladin, he composed his "De hierosolymitana peregrinatione acceleranda" (P.L. CCVII, 1057), wherein he censures the indifferent <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the princes who deferred the undertaking of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> and threatens them with seeing the mission which they have deserted accomplished by the people. He also composed an "Instruction on the Faith" which <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> sent to the Sultan of <a href="../cathen/07619a.htm">Iconium</a>. In several of his letters he returns to the question of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>. His works were edited by Giles in "Patres Ecclesi&aelig; Anglican&aelig;", 4 vols. (Oxford, 1846-47), and in P.L., CCVII (4 vols., <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>).
