<h1>Peter the Hermit</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a> about 1050; d. at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Neufmoutier (Li&egrave;ge), in 1115. His life has been embellished by legend, and he has been wrongly credited with initiating the movement which resulted in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section1">First Crusade</a>. While the contemporary historians mentioned him only as one of the numerous preachers of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, the later chroniclers, <a href="../cathen/01261d.htm">Albert of Aix-la-Chapelle</a>, and above all <a href="../cathen/15639a.htm">William of Tyre</a>, gave him an all-important role. According to <a href="../cathen/01261d.htm">Albert of Aix</a> Peter having led during some years the rigorous life of a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> undertook a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Jerusalem and suffered much at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. One day when he was asleep in the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> appeared to him and ordered him to ask for credentials from the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and to go to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> proclaiming the miseries which had befallen the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Christian of the Orient</a>. Peter obtained the patriarchal letters and sought <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a>, who, moved by his recital, came to preach the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> at <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> ("Histor. Hierosol.", I. 2). According to <a href="../cathen/15639a.htm">William of Tyre</a> (I, II), it was of his own accord that Peter went to find the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of Peter is mentioned by Anna Comnena (Alexiad, X, 8), who, born in 1083, could <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of this story except through tradition; she relates, however, that he could not get as far as <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and that, resolved to undertake a second <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, he conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of preaching a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> in order to be able to go to the Holy Sepulchre attended by goodly company. It is evidently absurd to ascribe the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> to such an insignificant cause. Because of the silence of contemporaries and the later contradictory accounts, even the fact of the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> of Peter is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, while it is impossible to assign to him the role of promoter of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>. The merit of this belongs solely to <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Pope Urban II</a> (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">CRUSADES</a>). Writers like <a href="../cathen/01261d.htm">Albert of Aix</a> wished to deprive the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of this honor in order to attribute it to the ascetics so popular at that time in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. It is absolutely certain that it was only after the Council of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> that Peter commenced to preach the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>.

<p>In March, 1096, he led one of the numerous bands going to the East; his enthusiastic eloquence is described by the chroniclers. He arrived with his army at Constantinople 1 August, 1096. After a toilsome march as far as Nicomedia Peter pitched his camp at Civitot, and seeing his army without resources returned to Constantinople to solicit help from the Emperor Alexius. During his absence, the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>, commanded by Walter the Penniless, were massacred by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> near Nicaea (Oct., 1096). Peter assembled the remnants of his band and in May, 1097, joined the army of <a href="../cathen/06624b.htm">Godfrey of Bouillon</a> near Nicomedia. After this he had but an unimportant part. In Jan., 1098, at the siege of Antioch, he even attempted to <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> the army, but was prevented by Tancred. In spite of this cowardice he was one of the envoys sent to Kerb&ucirc;ga. On his return to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> he founded the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Neufmoutier. <em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">CRUSADES</a>.
