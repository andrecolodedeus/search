<h1>Petrobrusians</h1>  

<p>Heretics of the twelfth century so named from their founder Peter of Bruys. Our information concerning him is derived from the treatise of Peter the Venerable against the Petrobrusians and from a passage in <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard</a>. Peter was born perhaps at Bruis in south-eastern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The history of his early life is unknown, but it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who had been deprived of his charge. He began his propaganda in the Dioceses of Embrun, Die, and Gap probably between 1117 and 1120. Twenty years later the populace of St. Gilles near <a href="../cathen/11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a>, exasperated by his burning of crosses, cast him into the flames. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> suppressed the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> within their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, but it gained adherents at Narbonne, <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, and in Gascony. Henry of <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a>, a former <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, adopted the Petrobrusians' teaching about 1135 and spread it in a modified form after its author's death. Peter of Bruys admitted the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority of the Gospels in their literal interpretation; the other <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> writings he probably considered valueless, as of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> apostolic origin. To the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> epistles he assigned only a subordinate place as not coming from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> Himself. He rejected the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> as well as the authority of the Fathers and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. His contempt for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> extended to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and physical <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> was preached and exercised against <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. In his system <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is indeed a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> condition for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but it is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> preceded by personal <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that its administration to infants is worthless. The Mass and the Eucharist are rejected because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> gave his flesh and blood but once to His disciples, and repetition is impossible. All external forms of worship, ceremonies and chant, are condemned. As the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> consists not in walls, but in the community of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, church buildings should be destroyed, for we may <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a barn as well as in a church, and be heard, if worthy, in a stable as well as before an altar. No <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> of the living can profit the dead. Crosses, as the instrument of the death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, cannot deserve veneration; hence they were for the Petrobrusians objects of <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a> and were destroyed in bonfires.
