<h1>Petrus Bernardinus</h1>  

<p>Florentine <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>; born at Florence about 1475; died 1502. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were common folk, and he himself lacked all higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. But he attached himself with fanatical <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> to <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a>, and, by diligent attendance at his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> study of his writings, acquired a wide but superficial <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Peter preached to the people in the public squares of Florence and, during the lifetime of <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a> and after his death, he propagated secretly eccentric and revolutionary doctrines. According to him, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must be renewed with the sword; until this was accomplished, there was no need to confess, since all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a>, were unworthy. According to the Florentine chronicler, Cerretani, about twenty adherents of <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a> formed a <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret society</a> and elected Peter <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Tha latter, who was then twenty-five years old, assumed special <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions and anointed his followers with oil (the alleged anointment of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>). The members attended no Divine Service, but during their meetings <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in spirit under the leadership of Peter, whom they regarded as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. The association was discovered by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and at his request the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> proscribed its meetings. In 1502 the members left the town secretly and proceeded to Mirandola where Count Gian Francesco, a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> supporter of <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a>, gave them a friendly reception. When, a little later, the count was besieged by two of his brothers, who claimed Mirandola, Peter declared it <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will that Gian Francesco should overcome his enemies. However, Mirandola was taken and the count lost his territory in August, 1502. The sectaries falling into the hands of the victors, Peter and some of his companions were burned as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; the remainder were expelled or dispatched to Florence. The attempts of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> historians to stamp Peter as a forerunner of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> cannot be historically justified.
