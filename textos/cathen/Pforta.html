<h1>Pforta</h1>  

<p>A former <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (1137-1540), near Naumburg on the Saale in the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> province of Saxony. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was at first situated in Schm&ouml;lln on the Sprotta, near Altenburg. Count Bruno of Pleissengau founded there, in 1127, a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and endowed it with 1100 "hides" of land. This foundation not being successful, Bishop Udo I of Naumburg, a relative of Bruno, on 23 April, 1132, replaced the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> by <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/15537a.htm">Walkenried</a>. The situation here <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> undesirable, and in 1137 Udo transferred the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to Pforta, and conferred upon it 50 hides of arable land, an important tract of forest, and two farms belonging to the diocese. For this fact we have Udo's own statement in a proclamation of 1140. The place was called Pforta (Porta) on account of its location in the narrow valley which was the entrance into <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>. The patroness of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>, and the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Adalbert, 1132-1152. Under the third <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Adetold, two <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> were founded from it, in the Mark of <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a> and in <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a>, and in 1163, Alt-Celle and Leubus were also established in the latter province. At this period the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> numbered about eighty. In 1205 Pforta sent a colony of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to Livonia, founding there the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of D&uuml;nam&uuml;nde. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was distinguished for its excellent system of management, and after the first 140 years of its existence its possessions had increased tenfold. Little is known regarding the spiritual life of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> left no chronicles. At the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth century though a period of strife, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> flourished with redoubled vigour. The last quarter of the fourteenth century witnessed, however, the gradual decline of its prosperity, and also the relaxation of monastic discipline. When Abbot Johannes IV was elected in 1515, there were forty-two <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and seven <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> who later revolted against the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>; an inspection which Duke George of Saxony caused to be made revealed the fact that morality had ceased to exist in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The last Abbot, Peter Schederich, was elected in 1533. When the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Duke George was succeeded by his <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> brother Henry, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was suppressed (9 November, 1540), the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, eleven <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and four <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> being pensioned. In 1543, Duke Moritz opened a national <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, appropriating for its use the revenues of the suppressed <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Memleben. At first the number of scholars was 100, in 1563 fifty more were able to be accommodated. The first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> was Johann Gigas, renowned as a lyric poet. Under Justinus Bertuch (1601-1626) the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> attained the zenith of its prosperity. It suffered greatly during the <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a>, in 1643, there being only eleven scholars. Among its pupils may be mentioned the poet, Klopstock, and the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, Fichte. Since 1815 Pforta belongs to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and even at the present day the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> is held in high esteem. The church was built in the thirteenth century; it is a cross-vaulted, <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">colonnaded</a> basilica with an extraordinarily long <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a>, a peculiar western <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>, and a late Romanesque double-naved <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>. What remains of the original building (1137-40) is in the Romanesque style, while the restoration (1251-1268) belongs to the early Gothic.
