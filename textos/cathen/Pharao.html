<h1>Pharao</h1>  

<p>(Prah, <em>Par&lsquo;o,</em> or, after a vowel, <em>Phar&lsquo;o</em>; Greek <em>Phara&oacute;</em>; Latin Pharao).

<p>The title given in <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> to the ancient kings of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. The term is derived from the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Per&lsquo;o, "great house", which originally designated the royal palace, but was gradually applied to the Government and then to the ruler himself, like the Vatican and the Quirinal, for instance, in modern times. At the period of the eighteenth dynasty (sixteenth to fourteenth cent. <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) it is found in common use as a reverential designation of the king. About the beginning of the twenty-second dynasty (tenth to eighth cent. <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), instead of being used alone as heretofore, it began to be added to the other titles before the king's name, and from the twenty-fifth dynasty (eighth to seventh cent. <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) it was, at least in ordinary usage, the only title prefixed to the royal appellative. Meanwhile the old custom of referring to the sovereign simply as Per&lsquo;o still obtained in narratives. The Biblical use of the term reflects <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> usage with fair accuracy. The early kings are always mentioned under the general title Pharao, or Pharao the King of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; but personal names begin to appear with the twenty-second dynasty, though the older designation is still used, especially when contemporary rulers are spoken of. The absence of proper names in the first books of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> is no indication of the late date of their composition and of writer's vague <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> history, rather the contrary. The same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the use of the title Pharao for kings earlier than the eighteenth dynasty, which is quite in keeping with <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> usage at the time of the nineteenth dynasty.

<p>The first king mentioned by name is Sesac (Sheshonk I), the founder of the twenty-second dynasty and contemporary of Roboam and Jeroboam (<a href="../bible/1ki011.htm#vrs40">1 Kings 11:40</a>; <a href="../bible/2ch012.htm#vrs2">2 Chronicles 12:2 sqq.</a>). Pharao is not prefixed to his name probably because the Hebrews had not yet become familiarized with the new style. The next, Sua, or So, ally of Osee, King of Israel (<a href="../bible/2ki017.htm#vrs4">2 Kings 17:4</a>), is commonly identified with Shabaka, the founder of the twenty-fifth dynasty, but he was probably an otherwise unknown local dynast prior to Shabaka's reign. Winckler's opinion that he was a ruler of Musri in North Arabia, though accepted by many, is without sufficient foundation. Tharaca, who was the opponent of Sennacherib, is called King of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki019.htm#vrs9">2 Kings 19:9</a>; <a href="../bible/isa037.htm#vrs9">Isaiah 37:9</a>), and hence is not given the title Pharao which he bears in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> documents. Nechao, who defeated Josias (<a href="../bible/2ki023.htm#vrs29">2 Kings 23:29 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/2ch035.htm#vrs20">2 Chronicles 35:20 sqq.</a>), and Ephree, or Hophra, the contemporary of Sedecius (<a href="../bible/jer044.htm#vrs30">Jeremiah 44:30</a>), are styled Pharao Nechao and Pharao Ephree, according to the then <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> usage.
<h2>Unnamed pharaos of the Bible</h2>

<h3>The Pharao of Abraham</h3>

<p>The uncertainties attaching to ancient <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> make it impossible to determine the identity of the Pharao who ruled over <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> when Abraham arrived in the country. The <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> text gives 1125 years between Abraham's migration to <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a> and the building of the temple, whereas the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> allows 870 (see C<font size=-2>HRONOLOGY</font>). As the building is placed about 1010 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> by some scholars, and about 969 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> by others, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of Abraham's migration would be 2135 or 2094 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> for the <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> text, and 1880 or 1839 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> for the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>. Ancient <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> is as uncertain as that of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. If Meyer's dates, adopted in the article E<font size=-2>GYPT</font>, are correct, Abraham's journey to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> would have to be referred to the reign of one of the Mentuhoteps of the eleventh dynasty, or to that of either Usertesen (Sesotris) III, or Amenemhet III of the twelfth.
<h3 id="section2">The pharao of Joseph</h3>

<p>It is generally admitted that Joseph held office under one of the shepherd, or Hyksos, kings, who ruled in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> between the twelfth and eighteenth dynasties, and were finally expelled by Ahmose I shortly after 1580. The length of their rule is unknown, but probably it did not last much over a hundred years. Joseph's tenure of office would accordingly be placed in the seventeenth century <font size=-2>B.C.</font> If the Exodus took place at the beginning of the reign of <a href="../cathen/10208b.htm">Merneptah</a>, i.e., about 1225, as most scholars now maintain, and the sojourn of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> lasted 430 years, as stated in the <a href="../cathen/10035a.htm">Massoretic</a> text (<a href="../bible/exo012.htm#vrs40">Exodus 12:40</a>), the time would be about 1665. The names of four Hyksos kings are known to us from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> monuments, a Khian and three Apophises. <a href="../cathen/06463a.htm">George Syncellus</a> states that in his time (eighth cent. <font size=-2>A.D.</font>) there was a general consensus that the Pharao of Joseph was Apophis, probably Apophis II, the most important of the three. This opinion is possibly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but the history of the period is too obscure to allow a defininte statement.
<h3 id="section3">The pharao of the oppression and of the Exodus</h3>

<p><em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">ISRAELITES</a>.
<h3 id="section4">The other pharaos</h3>

<p>The Pharao with whom Adad sought refuge in the time of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> (<a href="../bible/1ki011.htm#vrs17">1 Kings 11:17</a>) was a king of the twenty-first dynasty, either Paynozem or Amenemopet. Solomon's father-in-law (<a href="../bible/1ki003.htm#vrs1">1 Kings 3:1</a>) may have been Amenemopet, Siamon, or Pesibkhenno II. The Pharao mentioned in <a href="../bible/2ki018.htm#vrs21">2 Kings 18:21</a> and <a href="../bible/isa036.htm#vrs6">Isaiah 36:6</a> is by many thought to be Tharaca; but if the expedition of Sennacherib occurred in 701, as is generally held, there is little <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that Shabaka, or possibly Shabataka, is the Pharao referred to. Tharaca came to the throne some years later, and the title King of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> (<a href="../bible/2ki019.htm#vrs9">2 Kings 19:9</a>; <a href="../bible/isa037.htm#vrs9">Isaiah 37:9</a>) is given to him by anticipation. The unnamed Pharao of <a href="../bible/jer025.htm#vrs19">Jeremiah 25:19</a>, is probably Nechao, who is certainly meant in <a href="../bible/jer046.htm#vrs17">46:17</a> and <a href="../bible/jer047.htm#vrs1">47:1</a>; elsewhere Ephree is intended. The latter is also the Pharao of Ezechiel.
