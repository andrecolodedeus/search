<h1>Philadelphia</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> in Lydia, suffragan of <a href="../cathen/13472a.htm">Sardes</a>. The city was founded by Philadelphus, King of Pergamon (159-38 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), in the vicinity of Callatebus on the left bank of the Cogamus (Kouzou Tchai); its location was most favourable for commercial and strategical purposes. In 133 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> it became a Roman possession. It was subject to earthquakes, and at the time of <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> was almost in ruins; but, quickly restored, was of commercial importance as late as the Byzantine period. Its wines were famous; its <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> bore the image of Bacchus or a bacchante. On the <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> of the first century the city is called Neoc&aelig;sarea, under <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> it received the cognomen of Flavia. During the eleventh and succeeding centuries it was repeatedly captured by and retaken from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> until it was definitively conquered by Bajazet in 1390. In the seventeenth century it had 8000 inhabitants, of whom 2000 were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Today it has about 15,000, including 3500 Greeks. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> called it Ala Sheir; it is the capital of the caza of the vilayet of <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, is still, on account of its fertility, an important agricultural and commercial centre; and is a railway station between Smyrna and Dinair. It possesses numerous ruins, a theatre, stadium, two walls, many Byzantine churches, etc. and has mineral springs. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was introduced into Philadelphia in Apostolic times. According to the "Apostolic Constitutions" (VII, xlvi), its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Demetrius must have been appointed by St. John. The <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> St. Miltiades mentions a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophetess</a> Ammia who must have belonged to the primitive Church of Philadelphia (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.17</a>). One of the seven letters of the Apocalypse is addressed to the <a href="../cathen/01486a.htm">Bishop</a> of Philadelphia (<a href="../bible/rev001.htm">Revelation 1</a>, <a href="../bible/rev002.htm">2</a>, <a href="../bible/rev003.htm#vrs7">3:7-13</a>). This <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was highly commended, and while the writer recognizes that the community is small, he tells us that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who tried to disturb it were valiantly resisted by its faithful <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>. <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">St. Ignatius of Antioch</a> later sent to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Philadelphia an interesting letter warning them against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (Funk, "Die apostolischen V&auml;tter", T&uuml;bingen, 1901 pp 98-102). The ancient "Notiti&aelig;" place Philadelphia among the most important suffragans of <a href="../cathen/13472a.htm">Sardes</a>. Under Andronicus Pal&aelig;ologus it was raised to <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank, and has continued such among the Greeks, its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, since the fourteenth century, extending over many neighbouring sees, later obliterated by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> conquest. Among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, of whom <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a> (Oriens christ., I, 867 sq.) gives a very incomplete list, may be mentioned: Hetimasius, present at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> (325); Cyriacus, at the Council of Philippopolis (344); Theodosius, deposed at the Council of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> (359); Theophanes, present at the Council of Ephesus (431); Asianus (458); Eustathius (518); John, present at the Council of Constantinople (680); Stephanus at Nic&aelig;a (787); Michael under Leo the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>; Theoleptus at the end of the thirteenth and in the fourteenth century, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> writer, orator, and master of the famous Barlaam (P.G., CXLIII, 381 sq.); Macarius Chrysocephalas (1345) wrote <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> (ibid., CL, 227 sq.); Gabriel Severus (1577) wrote works against the Latins and resided, as did his six successors, at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>; Gerasimus Blachus (1679), author of numerous works; Meletius Typaldus (1685), deposed for becoming a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>.
