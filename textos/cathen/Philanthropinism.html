<h1>Philanthropinism</h1>  

<p>The system of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> educed from the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of Rousseau and of the German "Enlightenment", and established by Basedow on the basis of "philanthropy".

<p>Johann Bernhard Basedow (born at <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, 11 Sept., 1723; died at <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, 25 July, 1790) was a pupil at the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a> under the <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">free-thinker</a> Hermann Samuel Reimarus, studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, became (1749) a tutor in a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in Holstein, and (1753) professor at the academy for young noblemen at Soroe on the Island of Zealand, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. In 1761 he was removed from this position on account of his <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalistic</a> opinions and appointed professor in a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Altona. Here he published his "Methodenbuch f&uuml;r V&auml;ter und M&uuml;tter der Familien und V&ouml;lker" (Altona and Bremen, 1770; 3rd ed., 1773), in which he presented in detail his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> for the improvement of the school-system. This work and his "Agathokrator oder von der Erziehung k&uuml;nftiger Regenten" (Leipzig, 1771) attracted the attention of Prince Leopold Friedrich Franz of Anhalt-Dessau. In 1771 the prince called Basedow to Dessau, where he wrote his "Elementarwerk" (4 vols. with 100 copper-plates, Dessau, 1774; 2nd ed., Leipzig, 1785) which, in a form suitable to modern times, sought to present the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> carried out in the "Orbis pictus" of Comenius, of uniting the pictures of the things with the notions of them, by giving with pictures all the material essential for training children. In 1774 he opened a model <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Dessau, the "Philanthropinum".

<p>As the name signifies, it was to be a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of philanthropy for teachers and pupils. In contrast to the severe discipline of earlier days, children were to be trained in a friendly and gentle manner, instruction was to be made attractive, study as easy and pleasant as possible. The standard in forming the course of study was the practical and useful. Languages were to be taught more by practice and speaking than by the learning of grammatical rules, Latin, German, and French being regarded as the most important. Special attention was also given to the more practical studies, as arithmetic, geometry, geography, drawing, and natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. Basedow and his successors deserve credit for their improvement of methods and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> appliances. Special stress was laid on physical development. The fact that children belonged to a particular nation or religious confession was disregarded; <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was to produce cosmopolites. Religious instruction was to be replaced by the teaching of a universal natural morality. Among the teachers who aided Basedow in this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was Christian Heinrich Wolke, who had been his assistant before this in preparing the "Elementarwerk". Basedow, although a fine pedagogist, lacked the personal qualities <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for conducting such an institution, and retired in 1776. His place was taken (1776-77) by Joachim Heinrich Campe (1746-1818), who was later a prolific writer on subjects connected with Philanthropinism, and is best known by his German version of Robinson Crusoe called "Robinson der J&uuml;ngere"; his most important work is "Allgemeine Revision des gesammten Schul- und Erziehungswesens" (16 vols., 1785-91). For a short time after Campe had retired, Basedow, assisted by Wolke, was once more the head of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Among the others who taught for a time at this institution were Ernst Christian Trapp (1745-1818), who sought to systematize the philanthropinist principles and theories in his "Versuch einer P&auml;dagogik" (Berlin, 1780); Salzmann (see below), and Louis Henry Ferdinand Olivier (1759-1815). In 1793 this first 'Philanthropinum" ceased to exist.

<p>Those who held Basedow's pedagogical opinions were called <em>Philanthropen</em>, or <em>Philanthropisten</em>. In imitation of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Dessau institutions called <em>Philanthropin</em> were established at various places. The only <em>Philanthropin</em> that prospered and still exists was that founded by Salzmann at Schnepfenthal in the Duchy of Gotha. Christian Gotthilf Salzmann (born at S&ouml;mmerda near Erfurt, 1 June, 1744; died at Schnepfenthal 31 Oct, 1811) was one of the most distinguished pedagogues of the Philanthropinist <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and probably the most interesting <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> among all its representatives. He was originally a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at Erfurt; then, after writing on <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> subjects for some time, he became the teacher of religion at the Philanthropin at Dessau (1781-84), and in 1784 founded his own <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Schnepfenthal, which he conducted until his death. Like the entire Philanthropinist <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, his religious opinions were <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a>. The best known of his writings are "Krebsb&uuml;chlein oder Anweisung zu einer unvern&uuml;nftigen Erziehung der Kinder" (Erfurt, 1780, and frequently reprinted), a satirical account of the results of a wrong <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>; "Ameisenb&uuml;chlein oder Anweisung zu einer vern&uuml;nftigen Erziehung der Erzieher" (Schnepfenthal, 1806); "Konrad Kiefer oder Anweisung zu einer vern&uuml;nftigen Erziehung der Kinder" (Erfurt, 1796). The most important of Salzmann's assistants was Johann Christoph Friedrich Guts-Muths (1759-1839), who was the teacher of geography at Salzmann's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; one of his Pupils was the celebrated geographer Karl Ritter, the first pupil of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Schnepfenthal. Guts-Muths, however, is best known for his work in gymnastics. Friedrich Eberhard von Rochow (1734-1805) advocated views similar to those of the Philanthropinists but, unlike the actual members of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, did much for the improvement of primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>; his "Kinderfreund" (1775, and many later editions) was a widely used school-book. Finally Christian Felix Weisse (1726-1804), a voluminous writer for children, exerted great influence through his "Kinderfreund" (24 vols., 1775-84), a weekly publication for children.
