<h1>Philip Henry Sheridan</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/01256a.htm">Albany</a>, N.Y., <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> 6 March, 1831; died at Nonquitt, Mass, 5 August, 1888. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> were among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> pioneers who moved to Somerset, <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>, during his boyhood; he entered the U.S. Military Academy in 1848 from that state and graduated in 1853, receiving the rank of brevet second lieutenant of infantry. In the following year he was sent to <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> and there, and in <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>, served with much credit, settling difficulties with the Indians. At the outbreak of the Civil War he was made chief Quartermaster under General Halleck, and in May, 1862, was commissioned colonel of the Second Michigan Volunteer Cavalry. Rapid promotion followed, that of brigadier-general in July, and the command of a division of the Army of the Ohio in September; in the operations in the South-west, during the two following years, he greatly distinguished himself. Appointed commander of all the cavalry of the Army of the Potomac in April, 1864, he was thereafter one of General Grant's chief reliances in his operations in Virginia against Lee. During a brief absence of Sheridan in Washington, General Early attacked the Union Army near <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">Cedar</a> Creek, 19 October, 1864, and was at first victorious. Sheridan arrived during the retreat, rode at full speed from <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, arrived in the field, and rallying his men, converted the disaster into a complete victory. General Grant writing of this feat said: "Turning what bid fair to be a disaster into a glorious victory, stamps Sheridan what I have always thought him, one of the ablest of generals". In November, 1864, his commission of major-general in the regular army was awarded him. His raids during the early part of 1865, to destroy the railroads and the other avenues of supply to Lee's army, contributed much to the final surrender of the Confederate Army at Appomattox in April. After the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> Sheridan was appointed to command the military department in Louisina, <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a> and Missouri, and during 1870-1, at the period of the Franco-Prussian trouble, visited <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> where he was received with distinguished consideration at the headquarters of the German army, and was present at several important battles of the campaign. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general in 1869, succeeding General Sherman as commander-in-chief of the army in 1883, and shortly before his death, on 1 June, 1888, was confirmed as general of the army.
