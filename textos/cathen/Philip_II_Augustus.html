<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Philip II (Augustus)</h1>  

<p>King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, born 22 or 25 August, 1165; died at Mantes, 14 July, 1223, son of Louis VII and Alix de Champagne.

<p>He was saved from a serious illness after a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> made by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">Thomas &agrave; Becket</a>; he succeeded to the throne 18 September, 1180. His marriage with Isabella of Hainault, niece of the Count of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, the conflicts which he afterwards sustained against the latter, and the deaths of the Countess (1182) and Count of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> (1185), increased the royal power in the north of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. His strife with <a href="../cathen/07220b.htm">Henry II</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in concert with the sons of that monarch, Henry, Richard, and John, resulted in 1189 in the Treaty of Azay-sur-Cher, which enhanced the royal power in the centre of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The struggle with the Plantagenets was the ruling <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of Philip II's whole policy. <a href="../cathen/13041b.htm">Richard C&aelig;ur de Lion</a> having become King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, 6 July, 1189, was at first on amicable terms with Philip. Together they undertook the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section3">Third Crusade</a>, but quarreled in Palestine, and on his return Philip II accused Richard of having attempted to poison him. As Richard had supported in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> the claims of Tancred of <a href="../cathen/09107d.htm">Lecce</a> against those of the Emperor Henry VI, the latter resolved to be avenged. Richard, having been taken captive on his return from the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> by the Duke of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, was delivered to Henry VI, who held him <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. Philip II sent William, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, to Henry VI to request that Richard should remain the captive of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> or that he should be delivered to Philip as his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. Without loss of time Philip reached an agreement with John Lackland, Richard's brother. Normandy was delivered up by a secret treaty and John acknowledged himself Philip's vassal. But, when in February, 1194, Richard was set free by Henry VI, John Lackland became reconciled with him and endless conflict followed between Richard and Philip. On 13 January, 1199, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> imposed on them a truce of five years. Shortly after this Richard died. Subsequently Philip defended against John, Richard's successor, the claims of the young Arthur of Brittany, and then those of Hugh de Lusignan, Count of La Marche, whose <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> had been <a href="../cathen/01032b.htm">abducted</a> by John. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between Philip and John, interrupted by the truces imposed by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>, became a national <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; and in 1206 John lost his possessions in central <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Philip was sometimes displeased with the pontifical intervention between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the Plantagenets, but the prestige of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> forced him to accept it. Protracted difficulties took place between him and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> owing to the tenacity with which <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> compelled respect for the indissolubility of even royal marriages.

<p>In 1190 Philip lost his wife, Isabella of Hainault, whom he had married in order to inherit Artois, and in 1193 he married Ingeburga, sister of Canute VI, King of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>. As he immediately desired to repudiate her, an assembly of complaisant barons and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> pronounced the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, but Ingeburga appealed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Despite the remonstrances of <a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Celestine III</a>, Philip, having <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> Ingeburga, married Agnes de M&eacute;ran, daughter of a <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> nobleman. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, recently elected, called upon him to repudiate Agnes and take back Ingeburga, and on the king's refusal the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, Peter of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, placed the kingdom under an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> (1198). Most of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> refused to publish the sentence. The Bishops of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Senlis, who published it, were punished by having their goods confiscated. At the end of nine months Philip appeared to yield; he feigned reconciliation with Ingeburga, first before the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, Octavian, and then before the Council of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> (May, 1201), but he did not dismiss Agnes de M&eacute;ran. She died in August, 1201, and <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> consented to legitimize the two children she had borne the king, but Philip persisted that <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> should pronounce his <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> from Ingeburga, whom he held <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> at Etampes. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> refused and Philip dismissed the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> (1209). In 1210 he thought of marrying a princess of <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>, and in 1212 renewed his importunities for the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> with the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, Robert de Cour&#231;on. Then, in 1213, having need of the aid of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the King of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, he suddenly restored Ingeburga to her station as queen.

<p>Another question which at first caused discord between Philip II and <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, and regarding which they had later a common policy, was the question of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Otto of Brunswick, who was <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III's</a> candidate for the dignity of emperor, was the nephew of Richard and John Lackland. This was sufficient to cause Philip to interfere in favour of Philip of Suabia. They formed an alliance in June, 1198, and when Philip of Suabia was assassinated in 1208 Philip put forward the candidacy of Henry of Brabant. However, the whole of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> rallied to Otto of Brunswick, who became emperor as <a href="../cathen/11357a.htm">Otto IV</a>, and in 1209 Philip feared that the new emperor would invade <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. But <a href="../cathen/11357a.htm">Otto IV</a> quarrelled with <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> and was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by an unexpected move called upon Philip for subsidies and troops to aid him against Otto. They agreed to proclaim as emperor Frederick of Hohenstaufen, the future <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, Philip giving Frederick 20,000 "marcs" to defray the cost of his election (November, 1212). Thus was inaugurated the policy by which <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> meddled in the affairs of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and for the first time the French king claimed, like the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, to have a voice in the imperial election.



<p>The accord established between <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent</a> and Philip with regard to the affairs of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> subsequently extended to those of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Throughout his reign Philip dreamed of a landing in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. As early as 1209 he had negotiated with the English barons who were hostile to John Lackland, and in 1212 with the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a>. When John Lackland subjected to cruel <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who, in spite of him, recognized Stephen Langton as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> in 1212 placed <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, <a href="../cathen/11441a.htm">Pandulphus</a>, declared that John Lackland had forfeited his throne. Then Philip, who received at his court all the exiles from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, consented to go to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> to take away the crown from John Lackland. It was to be given to his son, the future Louis VIII. On 22 May, 1213, the French expedition was to embark at Gravelines, when it was learned that John Lackland had become reconciled with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and some months later he became a vassal of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Thus failed, on the eve of its realization, the project of the French invasion of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> induced Philip to punish Ferrand, Count of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, who was the ally of all the enemies of the king. At the battle of Bouvines (27 July, 1214) Ferrand, who supported <a href="../cathen/11357a.htm">Otto IV</a>, was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. This battle is regarded as the first French national victory. Philip II, asserting that he had on both sides two great and terrible lions, Otto and John, excused himself from taking part in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>. He permitted his son Louis to make two expeditions into Languedoc to support Simon de Montfort in 1215, and Amaury de Montfort in 1219, and again in 1222 he sent Amaury de Montfort two hundred <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> and ten thousand foot soldiers under the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> and the Count of La Marche. He foresaw that the French monarchy would profit by the defeat of the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>.

<p>Philip's reign was characterized by a gigantic advance of the French monarchy. Before his time the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> reigned only over the Ile de France and Berri, and had no communication with the sea. To this patrimony Philip II added Artois, Amienois, Valois, Vernandois, a large portion of Beauvaisis, <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, Anjou, Touraine, and a part of Poitou and Saintonge. His bailiffs and seneschals established the royal power firmly in those countries. <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> became a fortified city and attracted to its <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> students from different countries. Thanks to the possession of Dieppe, <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, and certain parts of Saintonge, the French monarchy became a maritime and commercial power, and Philip invited foreign merchants to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, Ponthieu, and Auvergne became subject fiefs, supervised by agents of the king. He exercised a sort of protectorate over Champagne and <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>. Brittany was in the hands of Pierre de Dreux, a Capetian of the younger branch. "History", writes M. Luchaire, "does not present so many, such rapid, and such complete changes in the fortune of a State".

<p>Philip Augustus did not interfere in episcopal elections. In Normandy, where the Plantagenets had assumed the custom of directly nominating the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, he did not follow their example. Guillaume Le Breton, in his poem the "Philippide", makes him say: "I leave to the men of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the things that pertain to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." He favoured the emancipation of communes, desiring to be liked by the middle classes of the districts he annexed. He often exacted a tax in exchange for the communal charter. But he did not allow the communes to infringe on the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> or the episcopal right of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. At Noyen he intervened formally in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who was threatened by the commune. He undertook a campaign in defence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> against certain <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> lords whom he himself desired to humiliate or weaken. In 1180, before he was king, he undertook an expedition into Berri to punish the Lord of Charenton, the enemy of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and into <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> where the Count of Chalon and the Lord of Beaujeu were persecuting the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1186, on the complaint of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, he took possession of Chatillon-sur-Seine, in the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, and forced the duke to repair the wrongs he had committed against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1210 he sent troops to protect the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>, who was threatened by the Count of Auvergne.

<p>But on the other hand, in virtue of the preponderance which he wished royalty to have over <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudalism</a>, he exacted of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> the performance of all their <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, including military service; although for certain territories he was the vassal of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Picardy, he refused to pay them homage. Moreover, he declared with regard to Manasses, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Orl&eacute;ans, that the royal court was entitled to judge at the trials of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and he made common cause with lay <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudalism</a> in the endless discussions regarding the province of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunals, which at the beginning of the thirteenth century were disposed to extend their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. An ordinance issued about 1205 at the instance of the king, executed in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a> and perhaps elsewhere, stipulated that in certain cases lay judges might arrest and try guilty <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, that the right of asylum of religious buildings should be limited, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> might not <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> those who did business on Sunday or held intercourse with <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and that a citizen having several children should not give more than half of his estate to that one of his sons who was a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>. Finally he imposed on the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> heavy financial exactions. He was the first king who endeavoured to compel <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to pay the king a tenth of their income. In 1188 the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> Peter of <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a> defeated this claim, but in 1215 and 1218 Philip renewed it, and by degrees the resistance of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> gave way. Philip, however, was <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> in his own way, and in the advice which St. Louis gave to his son he said that Philip, because of "God's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and mercy would rather lose his throne than dispute with the servants of Holy Church". Thus the reputation left by Philip II was quite different from that of <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip IV</a>, or <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. He never carried out towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a policy of trickery or petty vexations, on the contrary he regarded it as his collaborator in the foundation of French unity.
