<h1>Philip Michael Ellis</h1>  

<p>First <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of the Western District, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, subsequently <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13683b.htm">Segni</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, b. in 1652; d. 16 Nov., 1726. He was the son of the Rev. John Ellis, Rector of Waddesdon, Buckinghamshire, a descendant of the Ellis <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Kiddall Hall, Yorkshire, and Susannah Welbore. Of six brothers, John, the eldest, became Under-Secretary of State to William III; William, a Jacobite <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, was Secretary of State of James II in exile; Philip became a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; Welbore became <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Kildare and afterwards of <a href="../cathen/10097a.htm">Meath</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>; Samuel was Marshal of King's Bench; and Charles an <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>. Philip, while still a Westminster schoolboy, was converted to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, and when eighteen years old went to St. Gregory's, <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">professed</a>, taking the name of Michael in religion (30 Nov., 1670). After <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he returned in 1685 to the English mission where he became one of the royal <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>. In 1688 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> of the newly created Western District and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/01136b.htm">Mgr. d'Adda</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> (6 May). At the <a href="../cathen/13007b.htm">revolution in 1688</a> he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, but being soon liberated he retired to Saint-Germain and afterwards to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1696 he was named assistant <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> at the pontifical throne; and in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of English affairs made him so useful that his repeated petitions for leave to return to his vicariate were refused. In 1704 he resigned the vicariate, and in 1708 was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13683b.htm">Segni</a>, being <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> on 28 Oct. His first care was to rebuild the ruined <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of S. Chiara and open it as a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. This he enriched with many gifts and a large legacy. A curios survival of his English title survives in an inscription at <a href="../cathen/13683b.htm">Segni</a> to "Ph. M. Mylord Ellis". Eleven sermons preached in 1685 and 1686 before James II, Queen Mary of <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, and Queen Henrietta Maria, were published in pamphlet form, some of which have been reprinted (London, 1741; 1772). The Acts of his synod at <a href="../cathen/13683b.htm">Segni</a> in 1710 were also published by order of <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>.
