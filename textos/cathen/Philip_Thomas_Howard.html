<h1>Philip Thomas Howard</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, commonly called the "Cardinal of Norfolk"; born at Arundel House, London, 21 September, 1629; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 17 June, 1694. He was the third son of Henry Frederick Howard, afterwards Earl of Arundel and Surrey and head of the House of Norfolk (the dukedom of Norfolk being forfeited, though restored in 1660). The mother of Philip was Elizabeth, daughter of the Duke of Lennox; he was thus allied to the reigning sovereign of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. At the age of sixteen he joined the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, was professed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1646, and took the name of Thomas in religion. Residing at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> for his studies, he was chosen to deliver a Latin address to the general chapter of his order in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He justified the choice delivering a fervent address on the conversion of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, which led to a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> being passed by the chapter, urging <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a> and <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> to do all they could to receive English, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, and Scotch <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> into the order, with a view to its preservation in those countries. He was thenceforth wholly devoted to the conversion of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and to the progress of his order in that country. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1652, and with the sanction of his superiors set himself to carry out the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> he had matured in his mind. He founded the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Bornhem in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, with a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for English youths attached to it, and was himself the first prior and <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> master. He also founded at Vilvorde a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the Second <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>, now at Carisbrooke.

<p>In the reign of Charles II Father Howard was made grand almoner to Queen Catherine of Braganza. He resided at St. James's Palace, with a salary of 500 pounds a year, and had a position of influence at Court. An outbreak of <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritan</a> <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> compelling him to leave <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, he resumed his position as prior at Bornhem. He was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1675, by <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Pope Clement X</a>, being assigned the title of S. Cecilia trans Tiberim, exchanged later for the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> church of S. Maria supra Minervam. He now took up his residence at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and entered into the service of the Universal Church, especially watching over the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In 1672 he was nominated by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> as <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> with a see <em><a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">in partibus</a></em>, but the appointment, owing to the opposition of the "English Chapter" to his being a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a>, and the insistence that he should be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, was not confirmed. He was to have been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07204a.htm">Helenopolis</a>. In 1679 he was made Protector of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. At his instance the Feast of <a href="../cathen/05322a.htm">St. Edward the Confessor</a> was extended to the whole Church. He rebuilt the English College in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and revised the rules of <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> College.

<p>Cardinal Howard cooperated later with James II in the increase of <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> from one to four, an arrangement which lasted till 1840, when the number was increased to eight by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>. Burnet shows in his "History" that Cardinal Howard regretted the steps which led to the crisis in the reign of James II and which his counsels sought to avert. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> plans were thwarted and the ill-starred mission of the Earl of Castlemaine to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> showed the rise of another spirit which he did not share. When the crisis he foresaw came, he had the consolation at least of knowing that his foundation at Bornhem was beyond the grasp of the new <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a>. Cardinal Howard assisted at three <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclaves</a>, for the election of <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> in 1676, <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Alexander VIII</a> in 1689, and <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> in 1691. He died in the twentieth year of his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, at the age of 64, and was buried in his titular church of S. Maria supra Minervam at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>His foundations in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> flourished till the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, when they were despoiled to a great extent, and were eventually transferred to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The English <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Province looks to him as its father and restorer, and the American Province also regards him to a great extent in the same light. After his death the Master General, Father Antoninus Cloche, addressed a letter to the whole order, lamenting the loss of one who had done so great a work for the English Church and the order.
