<h1>Philippi</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> in <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a>. As early as the sixth century <font size=-2>B.C.</font> we learn of a region called Datos, overrun by the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/14556b.htm">Thasos</a>, in which there was an outlying post called Crenides (the little springs), and a seaport, Neapolis or Cavala. About 460 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> Crenides and the country lying inland fell into the hands of the Thracians, who doubtless were its original inhabitants. In 360 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> the Thasians, aided by Callistratus the Athenian and other exiles, re-established the town of Datos, just when the discovery of auriferous deposits was exciting the neighbouring peoples. Philip of <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Macedonia</a> took possession of it, and gave it his name, Philippi in the plural, as there were different sections of the town scattered at the foot of Mount Pang&aelig;us. He erected there a fortress barring the road between the Pang&aelig;us and the H&aelig;mus. The gold mines, called Asyla, which were energetically worked, gave Philip an annual revenue of more than 1000 talents. In 168 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> the Romans captured the place. In the autumn of 42 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> the celebrated battle between the triumvirs and Brutus and Cassius was fought on the neighbouring marshy plain. In the first conflict Brutus triumphed over Octavius, whilst Antony repulsed Cassius, who committed <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a>. Unable to maintain discipline in his army, and defeated twenty days later, Brutus also took his life. The same year a Roman colony was established there, which after the battle of Actium took the name of <a href="../cathen/04125b.htm">Colonia</a> Augusta Julia Philippensis. When <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">St. Ignatius of Antioch</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> Zosimus and Rufus were passing through Philippi, St. Ignatius told the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of that town to send a letter of congratulation to the faithful of Antioch. They therefore wrote to <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp of Smyrna</a>, asking him at the same time for the writings of St. Ignatius. <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> answered them in a letter, still extant, which was written before the death of St. Ignatius.

<p>Although the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Philippi was of Apostolic origin, it was never very important; it was a suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>. Towards the end of the ninth century it ranked as a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> and had six suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>; in the fifteenth century it had only one, the See of <a href="../cathen/05380a.htm">Eleutheropolis</a>. The Archdiocese of Cavala was reunited to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> in December, 1616. In 1619, after a violent dispute with the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Drama, Clement, the titular of Philippi, got permission to assume the title of Drama also, and this was retained by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Philippi until after 1721, when it was suppressed and the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of Drama alone continued. In the "Echos d'Orient", III, 262-72, the writer of this article compiled a critical list of the Greek titulars of Philippi, containing sixty-two names, whereas only eighteen are given in <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, "Oriens christianus", II, 67-70. Some Latin titulars are cited in Eubel, "Hierarchia catholica medii &aelig;vi", I, 418; II, 238; III, 291; <a href="../cathen/09187a.htm">Le Quien</a>, op. cit., III, 1045. In the middle of the fourteenth century, Philippi is mentioned in connexion with the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> between John V, Pal&aelig;ologus, and Cantacuzenus, who has left a description of it (P.G., CLIV, 336). The ruins of Philippi lie near the deserted hamlet of Filibedjik, fifteen kilometres from Cavala, in the vilayet of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Salonica</a>; they contain the remains of the acropolis, a theatre anterior to the Roman occupations, a <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temple</a> of Sylvanus, and numerous sculptured rocks bearing inscriptions.
