<h1>Philippopolis</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> of Thracia Secunda. The city was founded by Philip of Macedon in 342 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> on the site of the legendary Eumolpins. As he sent thither 2000 culprits in addition to the colony of veterans, the town was for some time known as Poniropolis as well as by its official designation. During Alexander's expedition, the entire country fell again under the sway of Seuthes III, King of the Odrysians, and it was only in 313 that the Hellenic supremacy was re-established by Lysimachus. In 200 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> the Thracians, for a brief interval it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, drove back the Macedonian garrisons; later they passed under the protectorate and afterwards the domination of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the time of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, The city was now called Trimontium, but only for a very short time (Pliny, "Hist. Nat.", IV, xviii). From the reign of <a href="../cathen/13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a>, Philippopolis bears the title of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> on <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> and in inscriptions. It was there that the <em>conventus</em> of Thrace assembled. In 172 <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a> fortified the city with walls; in 248 Philip granted it the title of colony, two years before its destruction by the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, who slaughtered 100,000 men there (Ammianus Marcellinus, XXVI, x). Restored again, it became the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of Thracia Secunda.

<p>The exact <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the establishment of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in this town is unknown; the oldest testimony, quite open to criticism, however, is in connexion with thirty-seven <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 20 August, and who are said to have been natives of Philippopolis, though other towns of Thrace are frequently given as their native place. In 344 was held at Philippopolis the <em>conciliabulum</em> of the Eusebians, which brought together 76 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> separated from their colleagues of <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a>, or Sofia, and adversaries of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> and his friends. Among its most celebrated ancient <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> is Silvanus, who asked the Patriarch Proclus to transfer him to Troas on account of the severity of the climate, and whose name was inserted by <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> in the Roman Martyrology for 2 December. Philippopolis, which from the fifth century at the latest was the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolis</a> of Thracia Secunda and dependent on the Patriarchate of Constantinople, had three suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> in the middle of the seventh century (Gelzer, "Ungedruckte . . . Texte der Notiti&aelig; episcopatuum", 542); in the tenth century it had ten (ibid., 577); towards the end of the fifteenth century it had none (ibid.). The Greek <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> has continued to exist, in spite of the occupation of the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>. The latter, however, have erected there an <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> of their own. Though generally held by the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> Philippopolis was often captured by other peoples &mdash; Huns, Avars, <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> who retained it from 1204 till 1235. It was taken by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in 1370 and finally came under the sway of the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> in 1885. By transporting thither on several occasions <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> and Syrian colonists, the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> made it an advanced fortress to oppose the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>; unfortunately these colonists were nearly all <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> and especially <a href="../cathen/11583b.htm">Paulicians</a>, so the city became the great centre of <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. These <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> converted by the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> in the seventeenth century have become fervent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the Latin rite. The city called Plovdif in <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarian</a> contains at present 47,000 inhabitants, of whom about 4000 are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. The Greeks and <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> are fairly numerous; the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> is in charge of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>; there is a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which however has only from 20 to 25 students. The <a href="../cathen/02104a.htm">Assumptionists</a>, who number about 30, have had since 1884 a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> with a commercial department, attended by 250 pupils; the primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys was established in 1863 by the Assumptionist Sisters; the <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> have a boarding-school and a primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls; the Sisters of Charity of <a href="../cathen/01225b.htm">Agram</a> have an <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>.
