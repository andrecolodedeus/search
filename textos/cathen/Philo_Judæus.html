<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Philo Jud&aelig;us</h1>  

<p>Born about 25 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>. His <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> line, was one of the most powerful of the populous Jewish colony of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. His brother Alexander Lysimachus was steward to Anthony's second daughter, and married one of his sons to the daughter of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Herod Agrippa</a>, whom he had put under financial <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>. Alexander's son, Tiberius Alexander, <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatized</a> and became <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and Prefect of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Philo must have received a Jewish <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, studying the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and national traditions, but he followed also the Greek plan of studies (grammar with reading of the poets, geometry, rhetoric, dialectics) which he reagarded as a preparation for philosophy. Notwithstanding the lack of direct information about his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> training, his works show that he had a first hand <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the stoical theories then prevailing, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> dialogues, the neo-Pythagorean works, and the moral popular literature, the outcome of Cynicism. He remained, however, profoundly attached to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish religion</a> with all the practices which it implied among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of the dispersion and of which the basis was the unity of worship at the Temple in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. Toward the Alexandrine community and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> which it required of him, his attitude was perhaps changeable; he possessed in his youth a taste for an exclusively contemplative life and solitary retreats; and he complains of an official function which forced him to abandon his studies. Later he became engrossed with the material and moral interests of the community. His "Allegorical Commentary" often alludes to the vocations to which the Alexandrine <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were subjected; a special treatise is devoted to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Flaccus, Prefect of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. The best-known episode of his life is the voyage he made to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 39; he had been chosen as head of the embassy which was to lay before Emperor Caius Caligula the complaints of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> regarding the introduction of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of the emperor in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>. This hardship, due to the Alexandrians, was all the more grievous to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, as they had long been known for their loyalty, and their attachment to the empire was doubtless one of the chief causes of anti-Semitism at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. The drawing up of the account of the embassy shortly after the death of Caius (41) is the latest known fact in the life of Philo.
<h2>Writings</h2>

<p>These contain most valuable information, not only on the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and moral situation of the Jewish community at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, but still more on the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and religious <a href="../cathen/14383c.htm">syncretism</a> prevailing in Greek civilization. They may be divided: (1) exposition of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish Law</a>; (2) apologetical works; (3) <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> treatises.

<p>(1) The expositions of the Law are in three works of varied character: (a) "The Exposition of the Law", which begins by a treatise on the creation of the world (Commentaries on the first chapter of Genesis) and continues with treatises on Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph (those on Isaac and Jacob are lost). Each of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> is considered as a type of a virtue and the life as a natural or unwritten law. Then follows a series of treatises on the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> written by Moses, grouped in order according to the <a href="../cathen/04153a.htm">Ten Commandments</a>. The Exposition closes with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> referring to general virtues (On Justice and Courage), and a treatise on the reward reserved to those who obey the Law. (See "De Pr&aelig;miis et P&oelig;nis", &#167;&#167; 1, 2.) (b) The great "Allegorical Commentary on Genesis" is the chief source of information regarding Philo's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; in it he applies systematically the method of allegorical interpretation. The commentary follows the order of verses from <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#vrs1">Genesis 2:1</a> to <a href="../bible/gen004.htm#vrs17">4:17</a>, with some more or less important lacun&aelig;. It is not known whether the work began by a treatise on chapter 1, concerning creation; in any case, it can be seen from the allusions to this chapter that Philo had a system of interpretation on this point. Notwithstanding its form, this work is not a series of interpretations strung together verse by verse; the author considers Genesis in its entirety as a history of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from its formation in the intelligible world to the complete development of wisdom after its fall and its restoration by repentance (see ed. Mangey, "De Posteritate Caini", p. 259). The object of the allegorical method is to discern in each <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and in his actions the symbol of some phase either in the fall or in the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. (c) "Questions and Solutions" are a series of questions set down at each verse of the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> books. An <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> translation has preserved the questions on Genesis (<a href="../bible/gen002.htm#vrs4">Genesis 2:4</a>-<a href="../bible/gen023.htm#vrs8">23:8</a>, with lacun&aelig;) and the questions on Exodus (<a href="../bible/exo012.htm#vrs2">Exodus 12:2</a>-<a href="../bible/exo028.htm#vrs38">28:38</a>), some Greek fragments of these works and of the questions on Leviticus, a very mediocre Latin translation of the last part of the questions on Genesis (iv, 154 sq.). In Samson and Jonas, there is much less unity than in the preceding ones. This first group of works is addressed to readers already initiated in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a>, i.e. to the author's coreligionists.



<p>(2) It is quite different with his apologetical writings. The "Life of Moses" is a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish Law</a>, intended for a larger public. The treatise "On Repentance" was written for the edification of the newly converted. The treatise "On Humanity" which followed that "On Piety" seems from its introduction to pertain to the "Life of Moses" and not to the "Exposition of the Law" as tradition and some contemporaneous scholars maintain. The <em>Upothetin&aacute;</em> (fragments in Eusebius, "Evangelical Preparation", VIII, v, vi) as well as the "Apology for the Jews" (ibid., VIII, x) were written to defend his coreligionists against <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>, while the "Contemplative Life" was to cultivate the best fruits of the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> worship. The "Against Flaccus" and the "Embassy to Caius", with another work lost in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Sejanus, were intended to establish the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about the pretended impiety of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.

<p>(3) Finally, we have purely <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> treatises: "On the Liberty of the Wise", "On the Incorruptibility of the World" (authenticity contested by Bernays, but generally admitted now), "On Providence", "On Animals" (these last two in the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> translations). The small treatise "De Mundo" is merely a compilation of passages from other works. The question of <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> is more difficult than that of classification. The solution of the difficulty would be of great value especially for the subdivisions of the first group of writings, in order to understand the development of Philo's doctrines; but on this point there is a wide divergence of opinion. It is probable, however, that the "Exposition of the Law" with the frequent appeals to the authority of the masters and its cautious way of introducing the allegorical interpretation is anterior to the "Allegorical Commentary" which shows more assurance and independence of thought.
<h2>Doctrine</h2>

<p>Philo's work belongs for the most part to the immense literature of commentaries on the Law, and it is especially as a commentator that he must be considered. But in this regard he holds a unique place. First of all, he uses the Greek translation of the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>. The variations that have been pointed out between his text and that which we now possess of the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> may be explained to our satisfaction, not by the reading of the Hebrew text (Ritter), but by the fact that our recension is of a later date than the one he used. Furthermore, his method of interpretation appears as something new and original among the juridical commentaries of the Palestinian rabbis. Eliminating what formed the common basis of all commentaries of this kind&mdash;the interpretation of the Hebrew proper names (Philo gives them at times a Greek etymology), the particular rules for the signs which indicate that Moses intended us to look beyond the literal sense (Siegfried), the oral traditions added to the account of the <a href="../cathen/11646c.htm">Pentateuch</a> (and again, at the beginning of the "Life of Moses" these traditions are clearly of Alexandrine origin), and the prescriptions of the worship in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>&mdash;two essential features remain: first, the conviction that the Jewish law is identical with the natural; and then the allegorical interpretation. The first, according to which the acts of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and the prescriptions of Moses are regarded as ideals conformable to nature (in the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoic</a> sense), gives to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish religion</a> a universality incompatible with the narrow national Messianism of the Jewish sibyls. Philo thus abandons entirely the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> promises; there is no national tradition to exclude the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a> from <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>. To find his precursors one must go back to the Prophets; tradition he revives, but only with serious modifications. To the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of moral universality he adds the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of nature which he received from the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>. His interpretation is wholly bent on identifying the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Mosaic</a> prescription with <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>.

<p>The second feature is the allegorical interpretation. Without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> Philo had his predecessors among the Alexandrines. The <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this is found not in the fragments of Aristobulus (which are grossly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and later than Philo), but in the work of Philo himself, which is based sometimes on the authority of his predecessors, in the "Wisdom of Solomon" (an Alexandrine work of the first century <font size=-2>B.C.</font>, which contains some traces of this method), and finally in the description Philo has given us of the occupations of the Therapeut&aelig; and the <a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essenes</a>. The tradition, however, thus formed cannot have amounted to much, for it does not prevail against personal inspiration and it lacks unity. This interpretation appears to us rather as a day-by-day creation of that age, and in Philo's works we can follow an allegory in process of formation, e.g. the interpretation of man "after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". The development of the interior moral life as Philo conceived it is always bound up with his allegorical method. This method differs from that of most of his Greek predecessors who sought an artificial means to bring out the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> conceptions in time-honoured texts, such as that of Homer. As a rule he does not search in the <a href="../bible/index.html">sacred text</a> for any strictly <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> theory; more often he puts forth these theories directly on their own merits. Though at times enthusiastic in his admiration of Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, he does not try to represent them as unavowed disciples of Moses. What he seeks in Genesis is not this or that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but the description of the attitudes of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, such as innocence, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, repentance. The allegorical method of Philo neither proves nor attempts to prove anything. It is not a mode of apologetic; in the "Life of Moses" e.g. this method is seldom employed; the only apologetic feature is the presentation of the high moral import of the Jewish <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> taken in their literal sense. But the method is indispensable for the interior life; it gives the concrete image which the mystic needs to explain his effusions, and it makes the Jewish books profitable in the spiritual life. The spiritual life consists in the feeling of confidence which gives us <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a feeling which coincides with that of the nothingness of man left to his own strength. Faith in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not in itself the condition but the end or crowning of this life, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> oscillates between confidence in self and confidence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> conceived in His relations with the moral needs of man has the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotence</a> and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; it is by no means the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, in direct relation with the cosmos rather than with man.

<p>Under this influence the Philonian cult became an eminently moral one: the originality of Philonism consists in its moral interpretation of the actions of the divinity upon the world, which till then had been regarded more in their physical aspect. The fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is here that of Divine power conceived according to the manner of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and sovereignty in relation to man. It is remarkable that with this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> the cosmic power of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> or of Greek religion is transformed by Philo into moral power. Divine wisdom is without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> like the Isis in Plutarch's treatise, mother of the world, but above all mother of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> in the virtuous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The "Man of God" is the moral consciousness of man rather than the prototype or ideal. The Divine spirit is transformed from the material ether into the principle of moral inspiration. We recognize, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the traces of the cosmic origin of the Divine intermediaries; the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are material intermediaries as well as spiritual, and Philo accepts the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the power of the heavenly bodies as an inferior degree of wisdom. Nevertheless he did his best to suppress every material intermediary between man and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This is quite evident in the celebrated theory of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Logos of God</a>. This Logos, which according to the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> is the bond between the different parts of the world, and according to the Heracliteans the source of the cosmic oppositions, is regarded by Philo as the Divine word which reveals <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and calms the passions (see <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">L<font size=-2>OGOS</font></a>). It is finally from this point of view of the interior life that Philo transforms the moral conception of the Greeks which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> mainly in the most popular forms (cynical diatribes); he discovers in them the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the moral <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> accepted though but slightly developed by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> up to that time. A very interesting point of view is the consideration of the various moral systems of the Greeks, not simply as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, but as so many indications of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> progress or recoil at different stages.
