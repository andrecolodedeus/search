<h1>Phoc&aelig;a</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a> in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, suffragan of Ephesus. The town of Phoc&aelig;a was founded in the eleventh century <font size=-2>B.C.</font> by colonists from Phocidia led by two Athenians. They settled first on a small island on the neighbouring coast, a territory given by the Cym&aelig;ans, between the Bays of Cym&aelig;us and Herm&aelig;us, 23 miles north of <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>. It was admitted to the Ionian Confederation after having accepted kings of the race of Codrus. Its fine position, its two ports, and the enterprising spirit of the inhabitants made it one of the chief maritime cities of ancient times. Historians speak of it but rarely before the Roman <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against Antiochus, The pr&aelig;tor &AElig;milius Regillus took possession of the town (189 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>); he disturbed neither its boundaries nor its <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Aristonicus, who reclaimed the throne of <a href="../cathen/11666a.htm">Pergamum</a>, the Phoc&aelig;ans took his part and, through the intervention of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Massilia</a>, escaped being severely punished by the Romans. At the time the latter had definitively established his power in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, Phoc&aelig;a was only a commercial town; its money was <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coined</a> until the time of the later Empire; but its harbour gradually silted up and the inhabitants abandoned it. In 978 Theodore Carentenus built Bardas Sclerus near Phoc&aelig;a. In 1090 the Turk Tchaga of <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a> took possession of it for a short time. The <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> traded there after 1082, but the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> quickly supplanted them.

<p>In 1275 Michael VIII Pal&aelig;ologus gave Manuel Zaccaria the territory of the city and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to exploit the neighbouring alum mines. In 1304 the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a>, with the co-operation of the Greeks of the adjoining towns, erected a fortress to defend the town against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and some distance from the ancient Phoc&aelig;a founded a city which they called New Phoc&aelig;a. In 1336 Andronicus the Young, allied with Saroukhan, Sultan of <a href="../cathen/09533a.htm">Magnesia</a>, besieged the two towns and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> them to pay the tribute stipulated in 1275. They continued also to pay annually to Saroukhan 500 ducats. From 1340 to 1345 the Greeks occupied the two towns, and again in 1358 for a short period. At the time of the invasion of Timur in 1403, they purchased peace by the payment of money. In the midst of difficulties the <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> colony continued until the end of 1455, when it passed into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. In 1650 a naval battle between the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> took place in sight of Phoc&aelig;a. Today Phoc&aelig;a, in <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> Fotchatin, or Eski Fotcha (ancient Phoc&aelig;a), is the capital of a caza of the vilayet of <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>, has about 6000 inhabitants (4500 Greeks), and exports salt. About six miles to the north, Yeni Fotcha (new Phoc&aelig;a) is situated on the Gulf of Tchandarli; it has 4500 inhabitants (3500 Greeks), and exports agricultural products.

<p>Seven Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Phoc&aelig;a are known by their signatures at the Councils; Mark, at <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a> (344); Theoctistus, at Ephesus (441); Quintus, at Chalcedon (451); John, at Constantinople (692); Leo, at <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Nice</a> (787); Nicetas, at Constantinople (869); Paul, at Constantinople (879). In 1387 ancient Phoc&aelig;a was separated from Ephesus and given to the suffragan of <a href="../cathen/14060b.htm">Smyrna</a>. In 1403 it still had a titular. The <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> colony had its <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, seven of whose names are recorded from 1346 to 1475; the later ones were undoubtedly non-residents: Bartholomew, 1346; John, 1383; John, before 1427; Nicholas, 1427; Ludovicus, about 1450; Stephanus, 1457; &AElig;gidius, 1475.
