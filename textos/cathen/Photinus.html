<h1>Photinus</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> of the fourth century, a Galatian and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> to Marcellus, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>; d. 376. He became the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> in Pannonia, an important position on account of the frequent residence of the Emperor Constantius there. The city was more Latin than Greek, and Photinus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> both languages. Marcellus was deposed by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> party, but was restored by Pope Julius and the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Synod of Sardica</a> (343), and was believed by them to be <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. But Photinus was obviously <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, and the Eusebian court-party condemned them both at the Synod of Antioch (344), which drew up the "macrostich" creed. Three envoys were sent to the West and in a synod at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (345) Photinus was condemned, but not Marcellus; communion was refused to the envoys because they refused to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> Arius. It is evident from the way in which <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Pope Liberius</a> mentions this synod that Roman <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> were present, and St. Hilary calls its sentence a condemnation by the Romans. Two years later another synod, perhaps also at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, tried to obtain the deposition of Photinus but this was impossible owing to an outbreak of the populace in his favour. Another synod was held against him at <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>; some <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianizing</a> propositions from it are quoted by St. Hilary. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> appealed to the emperor, who appointed judges before whom he should be heard. For this purpose a great synod assembled at <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> (351). Basil, the supplanter of Marcellus as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a> and the future leader of the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a>, disputed with Photinus. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> was deposed, and twenty-seven <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematisms</a> were agreed to. Photinus probably returned to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at the accession of <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian</a>, like the other exiled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, for <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> says he was banished by Valentinian (364-75). Eventually he settled in Galatia. Epiphanius, writing at about the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death, considered his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> dead in the West. In Pannonia there were still some Photinians in 381, and a Photinian named Marcus, driven from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a>, found adherents in <a href="../cathen/04510a.htm">Croatia</a>. In later writers, e.g., St. Augustine, Photinian is the name for any who held Christ to be a mere man.

<p>We obtain some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of Photinus from the twenty-seven <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematisms</a> of the council of 351, of which all but 1, 10, 12, 13, 18, 23, 24, 25 (according to St. Hilary's order: 1, 10, 11, 12, 17, 22, 24, 25) and possibly 2 are directed against him. We have corroborative evidence from many writers, especially <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, who had before him the complete minutes of the disputation with Basil of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>. The canons obviously misrepresent Photinus's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in condemning it, in so far as they sometimes say "Son" where Photinus would have said "Word". He makes the Father and the Word one Person (<em>prosopon</em>). The Word is equally with the Father unbegotten, or is called a part of the Father, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> in Him as our logos is in us. The latent Word (<em>endiathetos</em>) becomes the explicit Word (<em>prophorikos</em>) not, apparently, at the creation, but at the Incarnation, for only then is He really Son. The Divine Substance can be dilated and contracted (so St. Hilary translates <em>platynesthai</em> and <em>systellesthai</em>, while Mercator's version of Nestorius's fourth sermon gives "extended and collected"). This is exactly the wording of Sabellius, who said that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <em>platynetai</em>, is broadened out, into Son and Spirit. To Photinus the expansion forms the Son, who is not, until the human birth of Christ. Hence before the Incarnation there is no Son, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is Father and Word, <em>Logopator</em>. The Incarnation seems to have been conceived after a <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> fashion, for Photinus declared the Son of Mary to be mere man, and this is the best-known point in his teaching. He was consequently classed with <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>; Jerome even calls him an <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionite</a>, probably because, like Mercator, he believed him to have denied the Virgin birth. But this is perhaps an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. He certainly said that the Holy Ghost descended upon Christ and that He was conceived by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. By His union with the prophoric Word, Christ was the Son. The Holy Ghost is identified like the Word with the Unbegotten; He is a part of the Father and the Word, as the Word is a part of the Father. It is evident that Photinus went so far beyond Marcellus that it is unfair to call him his follower. In his Trinitarian <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> he is a Modalist <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Monarchian</a>, and in his <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christology</a> a Dynamistic <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Monarchian</a>, combining the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Theodotus with those of Sabellius. But it is clear that his views were partly motived by the desire to get away from the Ditheism which not only the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> but even the Eastern moderates were unable to avoid, and he especially denounced the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that the Son is produced by the Will of the Father. His writings are lost; the chief of them were "Contra Gentes" and "Libri ad Valentinianum", according to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>; he wrote a work in both Greek and Latin against all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and an explanation of the Creed.
