<h1>Photius of Constantinople</h1>  

<p>Photius of Constantinople, chief author of the great <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> between East and West, was b. at Constantinople c. 815 (Hergenr&ouml;ther says "not much earlier than 827", "Photius", I, 316; others, about 810); d. probably 6 Feb., 897. His father was a <em>spatharios</em> (lifeguard) named Sergius. Symeon Magister ("De Mich. et Theod.", Bonn ed., 1838, xxix, 668) says that his mother was an escaped <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> and that he was <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a>. He further relates that a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Michael of <a href="../cathen/14387a.htm">Synnada</a>, before his birth foretold that he would become patriarch, but would work so much <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that it would be better that he should not be born. His father then wanted to kill him and his mother, but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> said: "You cannot hinder what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. Take care for yourself." His mother also dreamed that she would give birth to a demon. When he was born the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the Maximine <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> him and gave him the name Photius (Enlightened), saying: "Perhaps the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will be turned from him" (Symeon Magister, ibid., cf. <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, "Photius", I, 318-19). These stories need not be taken seriously. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the future patriarch belonged to one of the great <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of Constantinople; the Patriarch Tarasius (784-806), in whose time the seventh general council (Second of Nic&aelig;a, 787) was held, was either elder brother or uncle of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> (Photius: Ep. ii, P.G., CII, 609). The <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was conspicuously <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> and had suffered some <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast</a> times (under Leo V, 813-20). Photius says that in his youth he had had a passing inclination for the monastic life ("Ep. ad Orient. et Oecon.", P.G., CII, 1020), but the prospect of a career in the world soon eclipsed it.

<p>He early laid the foundations of that erudition which eventually made him one of the most famous scholars of all the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. His natural aptitude must have been extraordinary; his industry was colossal. Photius does not appear to have had any teachers worthy of being remembered; at any rate he never alludes to his masters. <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, however, notes that there were many good scholars at Constantinople while Photius was a child and young man, and argues from his exact and systematic <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all branches of learning that he could not have been entirely self-taught (op. cit., I, 322). His enemies appreciated his learning. Nicetas, the friend and biographer of his rival Ignatius, praises Photius's skill in grammar, poetry, rhetoric, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, medicine, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, "and all <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>" ("Vita S. Ignatii" in <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XVI, 229). <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Pope Nicholas I</a>, in the heat of the quarrel writes to the Emperor Michael III: "Consider very carefully how Photius can stand, in spite of his great virtues and universal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>" (Ep. xcviii "Ad Mich.", P.G., CXIX, 1030). It is curious that so learned a man never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Latin. While he was still a young man he made the first draft of his encyclop&aelig;dic "Myrobiblion". At an early age, also, he began to teach grammar, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in his own house to a steadily increasing number of students.

<p>His public career was to be that of a statesman, coupled with a military command. His brother Sergius married Irene, the emperor's aunt. This connexion and his undoubted merit procured Photius speedy advancement. He became chief secretary of State (<em>protosekretis</em>) and captain of the Life Guard (<em>protospatharios</em>). He was unmarried. Probably about 838 he was sent on an embassy "to the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>" ("Myrobiblion", preface), i.e., apparently, to the Khalifa at <a href="../cathen/02202c.htm">Bagdad</a>. In the year 857, then, when the crisis came in his life, Photius was already one of the most prominent members of the Court of Constantinople. That crisis is the story of the Great Schism (see <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">GREEK CHURCH</a>). The emperor was Michael III (842-67), son of the Theodora who had finally restored the <a href="../cathen/07625a.htm">holy images</a>. When he succeeded his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> Theophilus (829-842) he was only three years old; he grew to be the wretched boy known in Byzantine history as Michael the Drunkard (<em>ho methystes</em>). Theodora, at first regent, retired in 856, and her brother Bardas succeeded, with the title of C&aelig;sar. Bardas lived in incest with his daughter-in-law Eudocia, wherefore the Patriarch Ignatius (846-57) refused him <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> on the Epiphany of 857. Ignatius was deposed and banished (Nov. 23, 857), and the more pliant Photius was intruded into his place. He was hurried through <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy Orders</a> in six days; on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, 857, Gregory Asbestas of <a href="../cathen/14395b.htm">Syracuse</a>, himself <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> for insubordination by Ignatius, <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> Photius patriarch. By this act Photius committed three offences against canon law: he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> without having kept the interstices, by an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> consecrator, and to an already occupied see. To receive <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> from an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> made him too <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> <em>ipso facto</em>.

<p>After vain attempts to make Ignatius resign his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, the emperor tried to obtain from <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Pope Nicholas I</a> (858-67) recognition of Photius by a letter grossly misrepresenting the facts and asking for <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to come and decide the question in a synod. Photius also wrote, very respectfully, to the same purpose (Hergenr&ouml;ther, "Photius", I, 407-11). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sent two <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, Rodoald of Porto and Zachary of <a href="../cathen/01448a.htm">Anagni</a>, with cautious letters. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> were to hear both sides and report to him. A synod was held in St. Sophia's (May, 861). The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> took heavy bribes and agreed to Ignatius's deposition and Photius's succession. They returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with further letters, and the emperor sent his Secretary of State, Leo, after them with more explanations (Hergenr&ouml;ther, op. cit., I, 439-460). In all these letters both the emperor and Photius emphatically acknowledge the Roman primacy and categorically invoke the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to confirm what has happened. Meanwhile Ignatius, in exile at the island Terebinth, sent his friend the Archimandrite Theognostus to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with an urgent letter setting forth his case (Hergenr&ouml;ther, I, 460-461). Theognostus did not arrive till 862. <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas</a>, then, having heard both sides, decided for Ignatius, and answered the letters of Michael and Photius by insisting that Ignatius must be restored, that the usurpation of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> must cease (ibid, I, 511-16, 516-19). He also wrote in the same sense to the other Eastern <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> (510-11). From that attitude <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> never wavered: it was the immediate cause of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. In 863 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> held a synod at the Lateran in which the two <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> were tried, degraded, and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. The synod repeats <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas's</a> decision, that Ignatius is lawful <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople; Photius is to be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> unless he retires at once from his usurped place.



<p>But Photius had the emperor and the Court on his side. Instead of obeying the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, to whom he had appealed, he resolved to deny his authority altogether. Ignatius was kept chained in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> letters were not allowed to be published. The emperor sent an answer dictated by Photius saying that nothing <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas</a> could do would help Ignatius, that all the Eastern Patriarchs were on Photius's side, that the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> must be explained and that unless the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> altered his decision, Michael would come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with an army to punish him. Photius then kept his place undisturbed for four years. In 867 he carried the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> into the enemy's camp by <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and his Latins. The reasons he gives for this, in an <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">encyclical</a> sent to the Eastern <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, are: that Latins <ol> <li>fast on Saturday <li>do not begin <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a> till <a href="../cathen/01775b.htm">Ash Wednesday</a> (instead of three days earlier, as in the East) <li>do not allow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to be married <li>do not allow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to administer confirmation <li>have added the <a href="../cathen/06073a.htm"> filioque</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04478a.htm">creed</a>. </ol> Because of these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and all Latins are: "forerunners of apostasy, servants of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> who deserve a thousand deaths, liars, fighters against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (Hergenr&ouml;ther, I, 642-46). It is not easy to say what the <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> thought of the quarrel at this juncture. Afterwards, at the <a href="../cathen/04310b.htm">Eighth General Council</a>, their <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> declared that they had pronounced no sentence against Photius because that of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was obviously sufficient.

<p>Then, suddenly, in the same year (Sept. 867), Photius fell. Michael III was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> and Basil I (the Macedonian, 867-86) seized his place as emperor. Photius shared the fate of all Michael's friends. He was ejected from the patriarch's palace, and Ignatius restored. <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a> died (Nov. 13, 867). <a href="../cathen/01156a.htm">Adrian II</a> (867-72), his successor, answered Ignatius's appeal for <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to attend a synod that should examine the whole matter by sending Donatus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, Stephen, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Nepi, and a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, Marinus. They arrived at Constantinople in Sept., 869, and in October the synod was opened which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> recognize as the <a href="../cathen/04310b.htm">Eighth General Council</a> (Fourth of Constantinople). This synod tried Photius, confirmed his deposition, and, as he refused to renounce his claim, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his party received light penances (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XVI, 308-409). Photius was banished to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Stenos on the Bosphorus. Here he spent seven years, writing letters to his friends, organizing his party, and waiting for another chance. Meanwhile Ignatius reigned as patriarch. Photius, as part of his policy, professed great admiration for the emperor and sent him a fictitious pedigree showing his descent form <a href="../cathen/07023a.htm">St. Gregory the Illuminator</a> and a forged prophecy foretelling his greatness (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XVI, 284). Basil was so pleased with this that he recalled him in 876 and appointed him tutor to his son Constantine. Photius ingratiated himself with everyone and feigned reconciliation with Ignatius. It is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> how far Ignatius believed in him, but Photius at this time never tires of expatiating on his close friendship with the patriarch. He became so popular that when Ignatius died (23 Oct, 877) a strong party demanded that Photius should succeed him; the emperor was now on their side, and an embassy went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to explain that everyone at Constantinople wanted Photius to be patriarch. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (<a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a>, 872-82) agreed, absolved him from all censure, and acknowledged him as patriarch.

<p>This concession has been much discussed. It has been represented, truly enough, that Photius had shown himself unfit for such a post; <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII's</a> acknowledgment of him has been described as showing deplorable weakness. On the other hand, by Ignatius's death the See of Constantinople was now really vacant; the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> had an undoubted right to elect their own patriarch; to refuse to acknowledge Photius would have provoked a fresh breach with the East, would not have prevented his occupation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and would have given his party (including the emperor) just reason for a quarrel. The event <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that almost anything would have been better than to allow his succession, if it could be prevented. But the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> could not foresee that, and no doubt hoped that Photius, having reached the height of his <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, would drop the quarrel.

<p>In 878, then, Photius at last obtained lawfully the place he had formerly usurped. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> acknowledged him and restored him to her communion. There was no possible reason now for a fresh quarrel. But he had identified himself so completely with that strong anti-Roman party in the East which he mainly had formed, and, doubtless, he had formed so great a <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, that now he carried on the old quarrel with as much bitterness as ever and more influence. Nevertheless he applied to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to come to another synod. There was no reason for the synod, but he persuaded <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a> that it would clear up the last remains of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and rivet more firmly the union between East and West. His real motive was, no doubt, to undo the effect of the synod that had deposed him. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sent three <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, Cardinal Peter of <a href="../cathen/03742b.htm">St. Chrysogonus</a>, Paul, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, and Eugene, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>. The synod was opened in St. Sophia's in November, 879. This is the "Psuedosynodus Photiana" which the Orthodox count as the <a href="../cathen/04310b.htm">Eighth General Council</a>. Photius had it all his own way throughout. He revoked the acts of the former synod (869), repeated all his accusations against the Latins, dwelling especially on the <em>filioque</em> grievance, <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> all who added anything to the Creed, and declared that <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> should belong to the Byzantine Patriarchate. The fact that there was a great majority for all these measures shows how strong Photius's party had become in the East. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, like their predecessors in 861, agreed to everything the majority desired (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, XVII, 374 sq.). As soon as they had returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Photius sent the Acts to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for his confirmation. Instead John, naturally, again <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him. So the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> broke out again. This time it lasted seven years, till Basil I's death in 886.

<p>Basil was succeeded by his son Leo VI (886-912), who strongly disliked Photius. One of his first acts was to accuse him of treason, depose, and banish him (886). The story of this second deposition and banishment is obscure. The charge was that Photius had conspired to depose the emperor and put one of his own relations on the throne---an accusation which probably meant that the emperor wanted to get rid of him. As Stephen, Leo's younger brother, was made patriarch (886-93) the real explanation may be merely that Leo disliked Photius and wanted a place for his brother. Stephen's intrusion was as glaring an offence against canon law as had been that of Photius in 857; so <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> refused to recognize him. It was only under his successor Antony II (893-95) that a synod was held which restored reunion for a century and a half, till the time of <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">Michael C&aelig;rularius</a> (1043-58). But Photius had left a powerful anti-Roman party, eager to repudiate the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> primacy and ready for another <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. It was this party, to which <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">C&aelig;rularius</a> belonged, that triumphed at Constantinople under him, so that Photius is rightly considered the author of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> which still lasts. After this second deposition Photius suddenly disappears from history. It is not even known in what <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> he spent his last years. Among his many letters there is none that can be dated certainly as belonging to this second exile. The <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death, not quite certain, is generally given as 6 February, 897.

<p>That Photius was one of the greatest men of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, one of the most remarkable characters in all <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, will not be disputed. His fatal quarrel with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, though the most famous, was only one result of his many-sided activity. During the stormy years he spent on the patriarch's throne, while he was warring against the Latins, he was negotiating with the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> Khalifa for the protection of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> under <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> rule and the care of the Holy Places, and carrying on controversies against various Eastern <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a>, <a href="../cathen/11583b.htm">Paulicians</a> etc. His interest in letters never abated. Amid all his cares he found time to write works on <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, Biblical criticism, canon law, <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, an encyclop&aelig;dia of all kinds of learning, and letters on all questions of the day. Had it not been for his disastrous <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, he might be counted the last, and one of the greatest, of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>. There is no shadow of suspicion against his private life. He bore his exiles and other troubles manfully and well. He never despaired of his cause and spent the years of adversity in building up his party, writing letters to encourage his old friends and make new ones.

<p>And yet the other side of his character is no less evident. His insatiable <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, his determination to obtain and keep the patriarchal see, led him to the extreme of dishonesty. His claim was worthless. That Ignatius was the rightful patriarch as long as he lived, and Photius an intruder, cannot be denied by any one who does not conceive the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as merely the slave of a civil government. And to keep this place Photius descended to the lowest depth of deceit. At the very time he was protesting his obedience to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> he was dictating to the emperor insolent letters that denied all <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. He misrepresented the story of Ignatius's deposition with unblushing lies, and he at least connived at Ignatius's ill-treatment in banishment. He proclaimed openly his entire subservience to the State in the whole question of his intrusion. He stops at nothing in his <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the Latins. He heaps up accusations against them that he must have known were lies. His effrontery on occasions is almost incredible. For instance, as one more grievance against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he never tires of inveighing against the fact that Pope Marinus I (882-84), <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII's</a> successor, was translated from another see, instead of being <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> from the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. He describes this as an atrocious breach of canon law, quoting against it the first and second canons of <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a>; and at the same time he himself continually transferred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in his <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. The Orthodox, who look upon him, rightly, as the great champion of their cause against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, have forgiven all his offences for the sake of this championship. They have <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> him, and on 6 Feb., when they keep his feast, their office overflows with his praise. He is the "far-shining radiant star of the church", the "most inspired guide of the Orthodox", "thrice blessed speaker for God", "wise and divine glory of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, who broke the horns of Roman <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>" ("Menologion" for 6 Feb., ed. Maltzew, I, 916 sq.). The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> remembers this extraordinary man with mixed feelings. We do not deny his eminent qualities and yet we certainly do not remember him as a thrice blessed speaker for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. One may perhaps sum up Photius by saying that he was a great man with one blot on his character---his insatiable and unscrupulous <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>. But that blot so covers his life that it eclipses everything else and makes him deserve our final judgment as one of the worst enemies the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Christ ever had, and the cause of the greatest calamity that ever befell her.
<h2>Works</h2>

<p>Of Photius's prolific literary production part has been lost. A great merit of what remains is that he has preserved at least fragments of earlier Greek works of which otherwise we should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing. This applies especially to his "Myriobiblion". <ol> <li> The "Myriobiblion" or "Bibliotheca" is a collection of descriptions of books he had read, with notes and sometimes copious extracts. It contains 280 such notices of books (or rather 279; no. 89 is lost) on every possible subject---theology, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, rhetoric, grammar, physics, medicine. He quotes <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, Acts of Councils, <a href="../cathen/09742b.htm">Acts of Martyrs</a>, and so on, in no sort of order. For the works thus partially saved (otherwise unknown) see Krumbacher, "Byz. Litter.", 518-19. <li> The "Lexicon" (<em>Lexeon synagoge</em>) was compiled, probably, to a great extent by his students under his direction (Krumbacher, ibid., 521), from older Greek dictionaries (Pausanias, Harpokration, Diogenianos, &AElig;lius Dionysius). It was intended as a practical help to readers of the Greek classics, the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>, and the New testament. Only one <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of it exists, the defective "Codex Galeanus" (formerly in the possession of Thomas Gale, now at <a href="../cathen/03211a.htm">Cambridge</a>), written about 1200. <li> The "Amphilochia", dedicated to one of his favourite disciples, Amphilochius of <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a>, are answers to questions of Biblical, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> difficulties, written during his first exile (867-77). There are 324 subjects discussed, each in a regular form--question, answer, difficulties, solutions---but arranged again in no order. Photius gives mostly the views of famous <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, Epiphanius, <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">Cyril of Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">John Damascene</a>, especially Theodoret. <li> Biblical works.---Only fragments of these are extant, chiefly in Catenas. The longest are from Commentaries on St. Matthew and Romans. <li> Canon Law.---The classical "Nomocanon" (q.v.), the official code of the <a href="../cathen/11329a.htm">Orthodox Church</a>, is attributed to Photius. It is, however, older than his time (see <a href="../cathen/08484b.htm">JOHN SCHOLASTICUS</a>). It was revised and received additions (from the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of 861 and 879) in Photius's time, probably by his orders. The "Collections and Accurate Expositions" (<em>Eunagolai kaiapodeixeis akribeis</em>) (Hergenr&ouml;ther, op. cit., III, 165-70) are a series of questions and answers on points of canon law, really an indirect vindication of his own claims and position. A number of his letters bear on canonical questions. <li> Homilies.---Hergenr&ouml;ther mentions twenty-two sermons of Photius (III, 232). Of these two were printed when <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a> wrote (in P.G., CII, 548, sq.), one on the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin, and one at the dedication of a new church during his second <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>. Later, S. Aristarches published eighty-three <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> of different kinds (Constantinople, 1900). <li> Dogmatic and polemical works.---Many of these bear on his accusations against the Latins and so form the beginning of the long series of anti-Catholic controversy produced by Orthodox <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. The most important is "Concerning the Theology about the Holy Ghost" (<em>Peri tes tou hagiou pneumatos mystagonias</em>, P.G., CII, 264-541), a defence of the Procession from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a> alone, based chiefly on <a href="../bible/joh015.htm">John 15:26</a>. An epitome of the same work, made by a later author and contained in Euthymius Zigabenus's "Panoplia", XIII, became the favourite weapon of Orthodox controversialists for many centuries. The treatise "Against Those who say that Rome is the First See", also a very popular Orthodox weapon, is only the last part or supplement of the "Collections", often written out separately. The "Dissertation Concerning the Reappearance of the Manich&aelig;ans" (<em>Diegesis peri tes manichaion anablasteseos</em>, P.G., CII, 9-264), in four books, is a history and refutation of the <a href="../cathen/11583b.htm">Paulicians</a>. Much of the "Amphilochia" belongs to this heading. The little work "Against the Franks and other Latins" (Hergenr&ouml;ther, "Monumenta", 62-71), attributed to Photius, is not authentic. It was written after <a href="../cathen/10273a.htm">C&aelig;rularius</a> (Hergenr&ouml;ther, "Photius", III, 172-224). <li> Letters.---Migne, P.G., CII, publishes 193 letters arranged in three books; Balettas (London, 1864) has edited a more complete collection in five parts. They cover all the chief periods of Photius's life, and are the most important source for his history. </ol> A. Ehrhard (in Krumbacher, "Byzantinische Litteratur", 74-77) judges Photius as a distinguished preacher, but not as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> of the first importance. His <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> work is chiefly the collection of excerpts from <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Greek</a> <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> and other sources. His erudition is vast, and probably unequalled in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, but he has little originality, even in his controversy against the Latins. Here, too, he only needed to collect angry things said by Byzantine <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> before his time. But his discovery of the <em>filioque</em> grievance seems to be original. Its success as a weapon is considerably greater than its real value deserves (Fortescue, "Orthodox Eastern Church", 372-84).

<p>Editions.--The works of Photius known at the time were collected by <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., CI-CV. J. Balettas, <em>Photiou epistolai</em> (London, 1864), contains other letters (altogether 260) not in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>. A. Papadopulos-Kerameus, "S. Patris Photii Epistol&aelig; XLV" (St. Petersburg, 1896) gives forty-five more, of which, however, only the first twenty-one are authentic. S. Aristaches, <em>Photiou logoi kai homiliai</em> 83 (Constantinople, 1900, 2 vols.), gives other <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> not in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>. Oikonomos has edited the "Amphilochia" (Athens, 1858) in a more complete text. J. <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, "Monumenta gr&aelig;ca ad Photium eiusque historiam pertinentia" (Ratisbon, 1869), and Papadopulos-Kerameus, "Monumenta gr&aelig;ca et latina ad historiam Photii patriarch&aelig; pertinentia" (St. Petersburg, 2 parts, 1899 and 1901), add further documents.
