<h1>Ph&oelig;nicia</h1>  

<p>Ph&oelig;nicia is a narrow strip of land, about one hundred and fifty miles long and thirty miles wide, shut in between the Mediterranean on the west and the high range of <a href="../cathen/09104a.htm">Lebanon</a> on the east, and consisting mostly of a succession of narrow valleys, ravines, and hills, the latter descending gradually towards the sea. On the north it is bounded by the River Orontes and Mount Casius, and by Mount Carmel on the south. The land is fertile and well irrigated by numerous torrents and streams deriving their waters mainly from the melting snows and rain-storms of the winter and spring seasons. The principal vegetation consists of the renowned <a href="../cathen/03473a.htm">cedars</a> of Lebanon, cypresses, pines, palms, olive, vine, fig, and pomegranates. On this narrow strip of land, the Ph&oelig;nicians had twenty-five cities of which the most important were <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, <a href="../cathen/13777a.htm">Sidon</a>, Aradus, Byblus, Marathus, and <a href="../cathen/15060a.htm">Tripolis</a>. Less important were Laodicea, Simyra, <a href="../cathen/01687d.htm">Arca</a>, Aphaca, Berytus, Ecdippa, Akko, Dor, Joppa, <a href="../cathen/06328a.htm">Gabala</a>, Betrys, and <a href="../cathen/13476a.htm">Sarepta</a>. The name "Ph&oelig;nicia" is in all probability of Greek origin, <em>pho&#238;niks</em> being a Greek derivative of <em>pho&#238;nos,</em> blood-red. Our principal sources of information concerning Ph&oelig;nicia are: first, numerous Ph&oelig;nician inscriptions found in Ph&oelig;nicia, <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and published in the "Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum", the oldest being a simple one of the ninth century <font size=-2>B.C.</font>; the rest of little historical value, and of comparatively late date, i.e., from the fourth century <font size=-2>B.C.</font> down; second, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> and Assyro-Babylonian historical inscriptions, especially the <a href="../cathen/14477d.htm">Tell-el-Amarna letters</a> of the fifteenth century <font size=-2>B.C.</font>, in which are found frequent and valuable references to Ph&oelig;nicia and its political relations with Western <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, especially in <a href="../bible/1ki005.htm">1 Kings 5</a> and <a href="../bible/1ki016.htm">16</a>; <a href="../bible/isa023.htm">Isaiah 23</a>; <a href="../bible/jer025.htm">Jeremiah 25</a> and <a href="../bible/jer027.htm">27</a>, and <a href="../bible/eze026.htm">Ezekiel 26-32</a>; finally, some Greek and Latin historians and writers, both <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a>.

<p>The oldest historical references to Ph&oelig;nicia are found in the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> inscriptions of the <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaohs</a>, Aahmes (1587-62 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) and his successors Thothmes I (1541-16 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), and Thothmes III (1503-1449 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) in which the Ph&oelig;nicians are called "Dahe" or "Zahi", and "Fenkhu". In the <a href="../cathen/14477d.htm">Tell-el-Amarna letters</a> is found much interesting information concerning their cities and especially <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, famous for her wealth. During all this period <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> suzerainty was more or less effective. Sidon was gradually eclipsed by the rising power and wealth of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, against which the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> were powerless, though they constantly attacked the former. About the year 1250, after conquering Ashdod, <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Askelon</a>, Ekron, <a href="../cathen/06399c.htm">Gaza</a>, and Gath, they forced the Sidonians to surrender the city of Dor. At this time <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> became foremost in Ph&oelig;nicia and one of the greatest and wealthiest cities of the Mediterranean region. Its first king was Hiram, the son of Abi-Baal and contemporary of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and Solomon. His reign lasted some forty years, and to his energy <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> owed much of its renown. He enlarged the city, surrounding it with massive walls, improved its harbours, and rebuilt the temple of Melkarth. He forced the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a> pirates to retreat, thus securing prosperity in maritime commerce and caravan trade, and Ph&oelig;nician colonization spread along the coast of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, and Africa. He established a commercial alliance with the Hebrews, and his Ph&oelig;nician artists and craftsmen greatly aided them in building the temple, and palaces of Solomon. He quelled the revolt in <a href="../cathen/15241b.htm">Utica</a> and established Ph&oelig;nician supremacy in North Africa where Carthage, the most important of all Ph&oelig;nician colonies, was later built.

<p>Hiram was succeeded in 922 by his son Abd-Starte I, who, after seven years of troubled reign, was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a>, and most of his successors also met with a violent end. About this time hostilities arose between Ph&oelig;nicia and Assyria, although two centuries earlier Tiglath-pileser I, when marching through the northern part of Ph&oelig;nicia, was hospitably entertained by the inhabitants of Aradus. In 880 Ithbaal became King of Ph&oelig;nicia, contemporaneous with Asshur-nasir-pal in <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a> and Achab in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. He was succeeded by Baal-azar and Metten I. Metten reigned for nine years and died, leaving Pygmalion, an infant son, but nominating as his successor Sicharbas, the high <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Melkarth, who was married to Elissa, his daughter. The tale runs that when Pygmalion came to manhood he killed Sicharbas, upon which Elissa, with such nobles as adhered to her, fled first to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and afterwards to <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, where the colony of Carthage was founded (c. 850 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>). Asshur-nasir-pal and his son and successor Shalmaneser II nominally conquered Ph&oelig;nicia; but in 745 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> Tiglath-pileser III compelled the northern tribes to accept Assyrian governors. As soon as this scheme of complete absorption became manifest a general conflict ensued, from which Assyria emerged victorious and several Ph&oelig;nician cities were captured and destroyed. The invasion of Shalmaneser IV in 727 was frustrated, but in 722 he almost sacked the city of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>. Sargon, his successor and great general, compelled Elul&aelig;us, King of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, to come to honourable terms with him. In 701 Sennacherib conquered the revolting cities of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Ph&oelig;nicia. Elul&aelig;us fled to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and Tubaal was made king.



<p>In 680 Abd-Melkarth, his successor, rebelled against the Assyrian domination, but fled before Esarhaddon, the son of Sennacherib. Sidon was practically destroyed, most of its inhabitants carried off to <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyria</a>, and their places filled by captives from <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a> and Elam. During the reign of Asshurbanipal (668-625 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> was once more attacked and conquered, but, as usual, honourably treated. In 606 the Assyrian empire itself was demolished by the allied Babylonians and Medes, and in 605 Nabuchadonosor, son and successor of Nabopolassar, after having conquered Elam and the adjacent countries, subdued (586 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Palestine, Ph&oelig;nicia, and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. As the <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyrians</a> had command of the sea, it was thirteen years before their city surrendered, but the long siege crippled its commerce, and Sidon regained its ancient position as the leading city. Ph&oelig;nicia was passing through its final stage of national independence and glory. From the fifth century on, it was continually harassed by the incursions of various Greek colonies who gradually absorbed its commerce and industry. It passed repeatedly under the rule of the Medo-Persian kings, Cyrus, Cambyses, Darius, and finally Xerxes, who attacked the Athenians at <a href="../cathen/13393a.htm">Salamis</a> with the aid of the Ph&oelig;nician navy, but their fleet was defeated and destroyed. In 332, it was finally and completely conquered by Alexander the Great, after whose death and subsequent to the partition of his great Macedonian empire amongst his four generals, it fell to Laodemon. In 214, Ptolemy attacked Laodemon and annexed Ph&oelig;nicia to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. In 198 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>, it was absorbed by the <a href="../cathen/13690a.htm">Seleucid</a> dynasty of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, after the downfall of which (65 <font size=-2> A.D.</font>), it became a Roman province and remained such till the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> conquest of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> in the seventh century. Ph&oelig;nicia now forms one of the most important <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> vilayets of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> with Beyrout as its principal city.

<p>The whole political history and constitution of Ph&oelig;nicia may be summarized as follows: The Ph&oelig;nicians never built an empire, but each city had its little independent territory, assemblies, kings, and government, and for general state business sent delegates to <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>. They were not a military, but essentially a seafaring and commercial people, and were successively conquered by the Egyptians, <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a>, <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>, Greeks, and Romans, to whom, because of their great wealth, they fulfilled all their <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> by the payment of tribute. Although blessed with fertile land and well provided by nature, the Ph&oelig;nicians, owing to their small territory and comparatively large population, were compelled, from the very remotest antiquity, to gain their livelihood through commerce. Hence, their numerous caravan routes to the East, and their wonderful marine commerce with the West. They were the only nation of the ancient East who had a navy. By land they pushed their trade to Arabia for gold, agate, onyx, <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and myrrh; to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> for pearls, spices, <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a>, ebony, and ostrich plumes; to Mesopotamia for cotton and linen clothes; to Palestine and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> for grain, wheat, and barley; to the regions of the Black Sea for horses, slaves, and copper. By sea they encircled all the Mediterranean coast, along <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, North Africa, <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, the &#198;gean Sea, and even <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. A <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> result of this remarkable commercial activity was the founding in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Crete, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a>, <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, and Greece of numerous colonies, which became important centres of Ph&oelig;nician commerce and civilization, and in due time left their deep mark upon the history and civilization of the classical nations of the Mediterranean world.

<p>Owing to this activity also, the Ph&oelig;nician developed neither literature nor acts. The work done by them for Solomon shows that their <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> and mechanical skill was great only in superiority to that of the Hebrews. The remains of their architecture are heavy and their &aelig;sthetic art is primitive in character. In literature, they left nothing worthy of preservation. To them is ascribed the simplification of the primitive, pictorial or ideographic, and syllabic systems of writing into an alphabetic one consisting of twenty-two letters and written from right to left, from which are derived all the later and modern <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> and <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> alphabets. This tradition, however, must be accepted with some modification. There is also no agreement as to whether the basis of this Ph&oelig;nician alphabet is of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> (hieroglyphic and hieratic) or of Assyro-Babylonian (cuneiform) origin. Those who derive it from a <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cypriot</a> prototype have not as yet sufficiently demonstrated the plausibility and probability of their opinion. The recent discovery of numerous Minoan inscriptions in the Island of Crete, some of them dating as early as 2000 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>, has considerably complicated the problem. Other inventions, or improvements, in <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and mechanics, such as weights and measures, glass manufacture, <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a>, the finding of the polar star, and navigation are perhaps justly attributed to the Ph&oelig;nicians. Both ethnographically and linguistically, they belong to the so-called <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> group. They were called <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Canaanites</a>, and spoke a <a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">dialectical</a> variety of the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Canaanite</a> group of Western <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> tongues, closely akin to the dialects of the <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, Palestine, and <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Canaan</a>. A few specimens of their language, as it was spoken by the colonies in North Africa towards the end of the third century <font size=-2>B.C.</font>, may still be read in Plautus, from which it appears to have already attained a great degree of consonantal and vocal decay. The dialect of the inscriptions is more archaic and less corrupt.

<p>Our information concerning the religion of the Ph&oelig;nicians is meagre and mainly found in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, in classical traditions, and legends. Of special interest, however, are the votive inscriptions in which a great number of proper names generally construed with that of some divinity are found. Ph&oelig;nician <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>, like that of the other <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> nations, was based partly on <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">Animism</a> and partly on the worship of the great powers of nature, mostly of astral origin. They deified the sun and the moon, which they considered the great forces that create and destroy, and called them <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> and Astaroth. Each city had its divine pair: at <a href="../cathen/13777a.htm">Sidon</a> it was <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> Sidon (the sun) and Astarte (the moon); at Gebel, <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> Tummuz and Baaleth; at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> Hamon and Tanith. But the same god changed his name according as he was conceived as creator or destroyer; thus <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> as destroyer was worshipped at Carthage under the name of <a href="../cathen/10443b.htm">Moloch</a>. These gods, represented by idols, had their <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, altars, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. As creators they were <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> with orgies and tumultuous feasts; as destroyers by human victims. Astoreth (Venus), whom the Sidonians represented by the crescent of the moon and the dove, had her cult in the sacred woods. <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> <a href="../cathen/10443b.htm">Moloch</a> was figured at Carthage as a bronze colossus with arms extended and lowered. To appease him children were laid in his arms, and fell at once into a pit of fire. When Agathocles besieged the city the principal Carthaginians sacrificed to <a href="../cathen/10443b.htm">Moloch</a> as many as two hundred of their children. Although this sensual and sanguinary religion inspired the surrounding nations with horror, they, nevertheless, imitated it. Hence, the Hebrews frequently sacrificed to <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> on the mountains, and the Greeks adored Astarte of <a href="../cathen/13777a.htm">Sidon</a> under the name of Aphrodite, and <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> Melkart of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> under the name of Herakles. The principal Ph&oelig;nician divinities are Adonis, El, Eshmon, <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, <a href="../cathen/06331b.htm">Gad</a>, <a href="../cathen/10443b.htm">Moloch</a>, Melkarth, Sakan, Anath, Astaroth, Rasaph, Sad, and many others.
