<h1>Pichler</h1>  

<p>A renowned Austrian <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of gem-cutters who lived and died in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.

<p>ANTONIO (JOHANN ANTON) born at <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a>, Tyrol, 12 April, 1697; died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 14 Sept., 1779. He was the son of a physician and had been a merchant until, travelling in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, he resolved to devote himself to art, He went to work in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> with a goldsmith and engraver of precious stones. In 1743, proficient in his new calling, he moved to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and copied many antiques. He attained excellence and fame, but was somewhat limited in his field for want of early training and grounding in design.

<p>GIOVANNI (JOHANN ANTON), the son of the foregoing, was born at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, 1 Jan., 1734; died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 25 Jan., 1791. He was a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, gem-cutter, and experimenter in encaustic and <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a>, a pupil of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> Corvi. His scholarship and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a> gave him unusual advantages. Early in life he executed a series of historical <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> at Orioli, and the Augustinians at Braccian; also a <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael</a> for the Pauline <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Later he devoted himself wholly to intaglio; he wrought gems of great beauty and finish, which resembled the classic so closely in style and execution that <a href="../cathen/15650a.htm">Winckelmann</a> is said to have thought them antiques. He was held in high regard and received innumerable honours and lucrative commissions. Works: Hercules strangling the Lion; Leander crossing the Hellespont; Nemesis, Leda, Galatea, Venus, Dancers, the Vestal Tuccia, <a href="../cathen/01701d.htm">Arethusa</a>, Ariadne Antinous, Sappho; portraits of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Emperor Joseph II</a>; and many other subjects. His son GIACOMO was trained to be a gem-cutter and executed many works in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, whither he had gone to be near his sister Theresa, married to the poet Vincenzo Monti. He died in early manhood.

<p>GIUSEPPE (JOHANN JOSEPH), born in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1760; died there, 1820. He was a son of Antonio by a second marriage and half brother to Giovanni, who taught him the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> art. Among his works are the portrait of Alexander I of <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; the Three Graces after <a href="../cathen/03298b.htm">Canova</a>; Achilles, Bacchus, Ceres, Io, Medusa, Perseus etc. He signs in Greek, like the older Pichlers IIIHLER, using the initial F.

<p>LUIGI, the most distinguished of the Pichler <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, was born in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 31 Jan., 1773, of the second marriage of Antonio; died 13 March, 1854. Losing his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> while very young, he was indebted to his half-brother, Giovanni, for his careful <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> under a private tutor and for four years of art training with the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a> De Angelis. Almost in childhood the boy had taken to himself the tools of the gem-cutter and, as he grew older, showed a special liking for cameo. Giovanni taught him their common art, and connoisseurs esteem that Luigi's incisions have even more finish, clearness, and light-gathering quality than those of his brother. He received many commissions from the Vatican and the Courts of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and kept a splendid house where music and masques were frequently given. He made several trips to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and was asked to found a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> there. In 1818 he copied in enamel five hundred gems of the <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> Cabinet which the emperor wished to present to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. For the same city he made a complete collection of copies of the intaglios of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and brother, adding a set of his own, thus bringing the historical collection of 1400 antiques up to modern times. Venus, Cupid and Psyche, Apollo, Head of Julius C&aelig;sar, Mars, Iris, the Day and Night of Thorwaldsen; and two exquisite heads of Christ are some of his subjects; besides many originals and portraits, including Giovanni Pichler's, <a href="../cathen/15650a.htm">Winckelmann's</a>, <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>. Luigi received innumerable honours from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and sovereigns of his day. His last gem, a head of Ajax, which he wished to present to <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, was placed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in a gold case in the Vatican collection with the signature II. L or IIIHLER, L. The <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the Pichlers is in S. Lorenzo in Lucina, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.
