<h1>Pierfrancesco Scarampi</h1>  

<p>Oratorian, Papal envoy, b. of a noble and ancient <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in the Duchy of Monferrato, <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, 1596; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 14 Oct., 1656. He was destined by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> for the military career, but during a visit to the Roman Court he felt called to the religious state. After much <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and with the advice of his confessor, he entered the Roman <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratory of St. Philip Neri</a> on 4 November, 1636. At the request of <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Fr. Luke Wadding</a>, the agent at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Confederates, <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 18 April, 1643, sent Fr. Scarampi to assist at the Supreme Council of the Confederation. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> addressed letters to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and also to the members of the Supreme Council, telling them that in order to show his great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and admiration for the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> people he had decided to sent to their aid Fr. Scarampi, a man of noble birth and eminent for his virtues and great administrative abilities. He told them to place full confidence in him as his representative and give him all help in the fulfillment of his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. He was received by the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> as an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Wherever he went he was met by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and nobility. He was received with military honours and firing of canon. On his arrival in Kilkenny he immediately saw that the danger that threatened the existence of the Confederation was dissension amongst its members. He made an earnest appeal to the Council to avoid all dissension and to make no compromise with the enemies of their religion and country. <a href="../cathen/02416a.htm">Richard Bellings</a>, Secretary of the Council, addressed to Fr. Scarampi a statement of the reasons in favour of a cessation of hostilities. Fr. Scarampi immediately gave a noble answer showing why the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> should be continued, and that the English desired the cessation of hostilities solely to relieve their present necessities. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the Supreme Council thanked the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for having sent to their aid a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of such exemplary life and excellent abilities of mind, and rejoiced at his presence amongst them. The author of "Contemporary History of Affairs in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>" says that Fr. Scarampi was a "verie apt and understandinge man, and was receaved with much honour. This man in a shorte time became soe learned in the petegrees of the respective Irish families of Ireland, that it proved his witt and diligence, and allsoe soe well obsearved that all the proceedings of both ancient and recent Irish, that to an ince, he knewe whoe best and worst beheaved himself in the whole kingdome."

<p>The Supreme Council decided to supplicate the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to raise Fr. Scarampi to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Apostolic nuncio</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> entreated him to accept the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/15079d.htm">Tuam</a>, which was vacant at the time. He declined all honours and refused to walk under the canopy prepared for him in Waterford. He was present with the Confederate forces at the siege of Duncannon, and when the fort was taken on the eve of St. Patrick, he ordered a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> to be immediately erected in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">saint</a> and celebrated the first Mass. On 5 May, 1645, he was recalled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a>. In taking leave of the General Assembly, he thanked all the members for their kindness to him, and again urged them to be firmly united. The President of the Assembly, after referring to all the fatigues that Fr. Scarampi had endured for the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> cause, said "that as long as the name of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion remained in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, so long would the name of Scarampi be affectionately remembered and cherished." After receiving the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Apostolic nuncio</a>, Rinunccini, he set out on his journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was followed to the ship by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, many comparing his departure to that of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> from <a href="../cathen/10303c.htm">Miletus</a>. All were in tears. He was accompanied by five <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> youths destined for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, whom he wished to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educate</a> and support at his own expense at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Among these youths was <a href="../cathen/12169b.htm">Oliver Plunket</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>. On his arrival at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he was thanked and praised by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for the great work he had done in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. When the plague broke out in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1656, he asked to be allowed to attend the sick in the lazaretto. He caught the sickness and died. By special permission he was buried in the Basilica of SS. Nercus and Achilleus on the Appian Way, the titular church of Cardinal <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>. In the lazaretto he wrote a most touching letter to <a href="../cathen/12169b.htm">Oliver Plunket</a>. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> commanded the <a href="../cathen/10039a.htm">Master of the Sacred Palace</a> to make known to the Fathers of the Oratory that the title of Venerable was to be given to Fr. Scarampi when writing about him and on his pictures.
