<h1>Piero da San Sepolcro</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">Painter</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/02686b.htm">Borgo San-Sepolcro</a>, about 1420; d. there, 1492. The most usual form of his name is the traditional one, PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA, which is better authenticated in contemporary documents than what in late research had been supposed to be the more correct form, PIERO DEI FRANCESCHI (Gronau, "Repertorium fur Kunstwissenschaft", xxiii, 392-4). He was the son of a notary, Ser Benedetto, a member of an influential <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> long identified with the government of the town&mdash;the Franceschi. His earliest artistic training is unknown, but he was active at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> in 1438, probably as an assistant to Domenico Veneziano, and he was certainly employed in the same capacity in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Sant' Egidio, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, in 1439-40. To Domenico and probably also to <a href="../cathen/15117c.htm">Paolo Uccello</a>, Florentine Realists who did much for the technical side of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, we may ascribe the formative influence in his art. Piero first appears as an independent master in 1445, when he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a still surviving <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altar-piece</a> of many panels for the Brotherhood of the Misericordia in his native town. He is said to have laboured with Domenico at Loreto, and he was certainly at <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a> in 1451, when he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a remarkable fresco in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of San Francesco, representing <a href="../cathen/09566a.htm">Sigismondo Malatesta</a>, Lord of <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, venerating his <a href="../cathen/11562a.htm">patron saint</a>, Sigismund. After this he was active at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> and Bologna, and, according to <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a>, he also decorated a room of the Vatican for <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Pope Nicholas V</a>. In 1454 he was again at <a href="../cathen/02686b.htm">Borgo San-Sepolcro</a>, where in 1460 he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> a fresco of <a href="../cathen/09385c.htm">St. Louis of Toulouse</a>, now preserved in the town hall. It was probably between this date and 1466 that he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> his masterpiece, the frescoes in the choir of San Francesco at <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a>, which may, however, have been begun earlier. The subject is the "Story of the True Cross", involving incidents beginning with Adam and including the story of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, Constantine and St. Helena, Heraclius and Chosroes. These frescoes rank with those by <a href="../cathen/09768a.htm">Masaccio</a> in the Brancacci Chapel as epoch-making in the decorative art of the fifteenth century.

<p>In the spring of 1469 Piero was at <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, lodging in the house of Giovanni Santi, the father of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, in which city a large part of his later activity occurred. From this period probably dates the remarkable <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptych</a> of the Uffizi, containing the portraits of the Duke (then Count) of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, the ideal prince of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, and the mild and refined image of his wife, Battista Sforza, with allegorical triumphs of these rulers on the reverse sides.

<p>About this time he also <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the well-known "Madonna" with <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> by the Duke of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, now in the Brera, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>; and the "Flagellation of Christ", a beautiful <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> composition in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>. According to a well-established tradition recorded by <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a>, Piero became blind in later life. At this time he wrote his celebrated treatises: "De quinque corporibus regularibus", which show him as a great geometrician, and his "Prospettiva Pingendi" (Treatise on Perspective), a manual for <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>. This work reveals him as the greatest master of the theory of perspective in his day, and gave him a reputation beyond <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. His testament is recorded 5 July, 1478, and he was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of his native town in 1492.

<p>His principal frescoes, besides those mentioned, include: the "Resurrection," in the town hall of <a href="../cathen/02686b.htm">Borgo San-Sepolcro</a>, a marvelous piece of foreshortening and perspective; a "Hercules", now in the possession of Mrs. J. L. Gardner of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>; and an imposing "Magdalen" in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a>. Among his panel pieces are the "Triumph of Chivalry" (New York Historical Society); the "Baptism of Christ" and the "Nativity", both in the National Gallery, London, the latter the first moonlight scene in modern <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>; an "Annunciation" in the Gallery at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>; "St. Michael" in London; and "St. Thomas Aquinas" in the Poldo-Pezzoli Museum at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. The charming "Portrait of a Young Girl" attributed to him in this gallery, as well as similar portraits in other <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> galleries, is now generally ascribed to another artist. Piero's position in the development of Italian art is a unique and important one. He is the greatest of that group of pathfinders, the Realists, whose scientific experiments created the grammar of modern <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. In mural <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> he towers above his contemporaries as the worthy successor of <a href="../cathen/09768a.htm">Masaccio</a>, and the connecting link between his art and that of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>. In the Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> his position was a dominant one; he may be called the founder of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The chief masters of the following generation&mdash;Perugino and the rest&mdash;either studied under or were influenced by him. Of his more intimate pupils, <a href="../cathen/10169c.htm">Melozzo da Forli</a> carried perspective to the highest perfection, while <a href="../cathen/13787a.htm">Luca Signorelli</a> developed figure-painting to the greatest excellence attained before <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>. To Florentine excellence of draughtmanship Piero united the superior colour sense of the Umbrians. Most remarkable was his rendition of light and air, in which he easily surpassed his contemporaries. His types are seldom beautiful, but they are strong and primeval, admirably modelled, and as impassive as the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> at the Parthenon. Perhaps the most striking feature of his art is this wonderful objectivity, in which regard he stands rivalled by <a href="../cathen/07385a.htm">Holbein</a> and <a href="../cathen/15323a.htm">Velazquez</a> alone in modern <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>.
