<h1>Pierre-Andr&eacute; Latreille</h1>  

<p>A prominent French zoologist; born at Brives, 29 November, 1762; died in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 6 February, 1833. Left destitute by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in 1778, the boy found benefactors in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and was adopted by the <a href="../cathen/07152a.htm">Abb&eacute; Ha&uuml;y</a>, the famous mineralogist. He studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1786, after which he retired to Brives and spent his leisure in the study of entomology. In 1788 he returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he lived till driven out by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>. Although not a <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, he was arrested with several other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, sentenced to transportation, and sent in a cart to <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> in the summer of 1792. Before the vessel sailed, however, Latreille made the acquaintance of a physician, a fellow - <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, who had obtained a specimen of the rare beetle, <em>Necrobia ruficollis</em>. It was through this discovery that Latreille became acquainted with the naturalist, Bory de Saint-Vincent, who obtained his release.

<p>He was again arrested in 1797 as an <em>&eacute;migr&eacute;</em>, but was once more saved by influential friends. In 1799 he was placed in charge of the entomological department of the Museum of Natural History in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and was elected a Member of the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">Academy</a> in 1814. In 1829 he was appointed professor of entomology to succeed <a href="../cathen/08753c.htm">Lamarck</a>. From 1796 to 1833 he published a great number of works on natural history. He was the real founder of modern entomology.

<p>His lesser treatises and articles for various encyclopedias are too numerous for detailed mention here; details of them will be found in "Biographie g&eacute;n&eacute;rale", XXIX, and in Carus-Engelmann, "Bibliotheca zool.", II (Leipzig, 1861). In his "Pr&eacute;cis des caract&egrave;res g&eacute;n&eacute;riques des Insectes" (Brives, 1795), and "Genera Crustaceorum et Insectorum" (4 vols., Paris, 1806-09), Latreille added very largely to the number of known genera, and he rendered an incomparable service to <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> by grouping the genera into <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, which are treated in the complete work "Histoire naturelle g&eacute;n&eacute;rale et particuli&egrave;re des Crutaces et Insectes" (14 vols., Paris, 1802-05). But his two most conspicuous writings on this subject of natural classification are; "Consid&eacute;rations sur l'ordre naturel des animaux" (Paris, 1810), and "Familles naturelles du r&egrave;gne animal" (<a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1825). His last work was "Cours d' Entomologie" (2 vols., Paris, 1831-33).
