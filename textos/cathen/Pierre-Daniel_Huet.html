<h1>Pierre-Daniel Huet</h1>  

<p>A distinguished savant and celebrated <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; born 8 February, 1630, at <a href="../cathen/03132a.htm">Caen</a> (Normandy), where his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, a convert from <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>, was sheriff; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 26 January, 1721. He was left an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> at an early age. While quite young he displayed a great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for study, especially for Latin poetry, geometry, and mathematics. After finishing his humanities, he attended lectures in law and acquired a very solid <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it, as his letters testify. He became a passionate admirer of <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes's</a> philosophy, and when the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> minister at <a href="../cathen/03132a.htm">Caen</a>, Samuel Bochart, the Oriental scholar, published his "G&eacute;ographie sacr&eacute;e", he was powerfully attracted to Biblical studies. Forthwith he began to learn Greek and Hebrew, and formed a friendship with Bochart, who assisted him in his studies. When this savant was called to Sweden by Queen Christina (1652), he brought young Huet with him. They did not remain there long, but Huet discovered at <a href="../cathen/14297a.htm">Stockholm</a> some fragments of a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, which inspired him with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of publishing the <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> works of the great Alexandrian Doctor. He gave himself up entirely to this labour for fifteen years and hardly ever left Caen, except for a month or two annually, when he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to study and to renew his acquaintance with members of the learned <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. By his letters, his Latin poems, and his visits he kept up a friendship with Rapin, Chapelain, Labbe, Cossart, Conrart, Pellisson, Vossius, Francius, and Cuyper. Queen Christina, who had become a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and resigned her crown, tried in vain to get him to come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, or to undertake the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of her successor, Charles Gustavus. He could not be induced to leave Caen, where he had founded an Academy of Science and was devoting himself to chemistry, <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a>, in addition to studying Arabic and Syriac and engaging in controversy with his old master, Bochart.

<p>In 1670, however, <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> called him to the Court to assist in the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of his son, the Dauphin, with the title of assistant-tutor, <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> being the tutor. While holding this office, he drew up the plan and directed the preparation of the famous edition of the ancient classics <em>ad usum Delphini</em>. He was elected to the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a> in 1674. A little later he decided to embrace the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a> and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1674, receiving from the king the Abbey of Aunay, in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>. He retired to Aunay as soon as the Dauphin's <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was completed (1680), and, giving himself up to his studies, wrote a number of works which are mentioned below. In 1685 he was named to the <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">See of Soissons</a>, but before being <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he exchanged it for the See of Avranches. On account of the difficulties that arose between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, after the Assembly of 1682 (see <a href="../cathen/06351a.htm">GALLICANISM</a>), he did not receive his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> until 1692. From that time, notwithstanding his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for study, Huet fulfilled his episcopal <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> most conscientiously. He made a visitation of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> on several occasions, in spite of the difficulties of travelling, and the memorandum of his ordinances is a witness to his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Nothing was neglected; be shows his anxiety for public morality, the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the young, the care of the churches, the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. At the same time he put his <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in charge of the <a href="../cathen/05596b.htm">Eudist</a> Fathers and reformed his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, giving them three collections of synodal decrees. Further he provided them with an edition of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, for which he himself composed the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>. After seven years' work in this ministry, the rigorous climate and his failing health compelled him, to the great regret of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, to tender his resignation. The king, in return, presented him with the Abbey of Fontenay, near Caen; he took up his residence in the house of the professed Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Here his time was spent in exercises of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, in interviews with the learned men of the day, and in composing his works. He died twenty years later, at the age of ninety-one, bequeathing his magnificent <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and leaving the reputation of being one of the most brilliant minds of the century.

<p>He owed this reputation to the immense number of his writings, which were as varied as were his studies. His literary works show him to have inherited and developed the spirit of the sixteenth century, rather than to have identified himself with the mind of the seventeenth century. He has the polish and, at times, the charm of the latter age, with his somewhat antiquated tendencies; he has the old literary style of Scud&eacute;ry, M&eacute;nage and Chapelain, rather than the refined taste and brilliant diction of <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> and <a href="../cathen/06035a.htm">F&eacute;nelon</a>, whom he was destined to survive. His historical writings and his works in <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegesis</a> display great learning and immense reading, but he does not exhibit in them the critical sense of a <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a>, the penetration of Richard Simon, nor the talent of <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>. Part of his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> writings are directed against <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a>, part against the worship of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a>. He reproaches <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a> with a want of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> in his method and with an anti-religious tendency. <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, who was not an admirer of <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes's</a> theory, protested, nevertheless, against the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> and irrelevancy of some of the criticisms of his learned friend. But it was his posthumous work on the limitations of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> that drew forth serious protest. In it Huet is a pure <a href="../cathen/06068b.htm">fideist</a>. For him, as for <a href="../cathen/11511a.htm">Pascal</a>, reason and sense are incapable of bringing us to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>; that can be done only by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> refused at first, in the "M&eacute;moires de Tr&eacute;voux", to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the authenticity of the work. In this they were mistaken; it certainly was Huet's; but they were right when they declared that, by decrying <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> as it did, such a work was more likely to weaken than to strengthen the foundations of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as its author bad intended.
