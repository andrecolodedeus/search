<h1>Pierre-Guillaume-Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Le Play</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economist</a>, born at La Rivi&egrave;re (Calvados), 11 April, 1806; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 5 April, 1882. His childhood was spent among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people, with a poor <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowed</a> mother. From the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Havre he went (1824) to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he followed the scientific courses of the Coll&egrave;ge St. Louis, the polytechnic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of mines. At the polytechnic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> he had as fellow-pupils the <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economist</a> Michel Chevalier, <a href="../cathen/06731b.htm">P&egrave;re Gratry</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Jean Reynaud. In 1829 with Reynaud he made a journey on foot through the Rhine provinces, <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, <a href="../cathen/03019a.htm">Brunswick</a>, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> to study mining, customs, and social institutions. On his return an accident in the course of a chemical experiment caused him eighteen months of suffering and deformed his hands for life. He became secretary of the "Annales des mines" and of "Statistique de l'industrie min&eacute;rale", and professor of metallurgy at the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of mines (1840). Each year he travelled six months, studying metallurgy and social problems, and questioning traders, workmen, owners, and peasants. He spoke five languages and understood eight.

<p>His life may be divided into two periods: from 1833-55 he invented, applied, and perfected his method; from 1855-82 he explained, developed, and perfected his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. In 1833 he visited <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; in 1835 and 1846 <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>; 1836 and 1842, Great Britain; 1837 and 1844, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; 1845, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>; 1844 and 1845, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; 1846, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Extracts from his correspondence with his wife and mother during his travels were published in 1899. During his sojourns in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> he was consulted by Nicholas I on various projects of reform, and, having undertaken at the instance of Prince Anatol Demidoff a scientific expedition into the coal regions of Donetz, the prince entrusted him with the superintendence of his gold, silver, platinum, copper, and iron mines, which employed 45,000 men in the Ural region.

<p>His conversations with Comte de Rayneval, French ambassador at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, to whom he had been recommended by Boieldieu, convinced him that the forced division of inheritances established by the Code Napol&eacute;on had <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> social consequences. His visit to the Baron de Tamm, who directed 2300 workmen at Osterby, near <a href="../cathen/15207a.htm">Upsala</a>, showed him what might be done by resident owners anxious for the welfare of their people, and his theory of "social authorities" slowly took form in his mind. Among the peasants and blacksmiths of the Ural region he observed a social condition very similar to the ancient <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> regime, and his statements regarding the comfort of these people coincided with those of <a href="../cathen/07059a.htm">Gu&eacute;rard</a> and Leopold Delisle concerning the prosperous condition of the French agricultural classes during the early centuries of <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudalism</a>. He thus formed <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> quite at variance with the juridical and historical conceptions propagated by the men of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. His "method of observation", the rules of which he gradually formulated, was in contradiction to the <a href="../cathen/07761a.htm">individualism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>. It consisted in studying, not the individual, but the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> (which is the real social unit), and in studying types of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> among the stationary element of the population whose members lead uniform lives and faithfully preserve their local customs.

<p>From 1848, during the months he spent in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Le Play held weekly gatherings of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of various opinions interested in the social question; among them were Jean Reynaud, <a href="../cathen/08754a.htm">Lamartine</a>, Fran&ccedil;ois Arago, Carnot, Lanjuinais, <a href="../cathen/14753a.htm">Tocqueville</a>, <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a>, Sainte-Beuve, Ag&eacute;nor de Gasparin, <a href="../cathen/05202a.htm">Abb&eacute; Dupanloup</a>, <a href="../cathen/14635b.htm">Thiers</a>, <a href="../cathen/04078b.htm">Auguste Cochin</a>, and Charles Dupin. During the social troubles which followed the Revolution of 1848 these men besought Le Play to abandon his teaching at the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of mines and to devote himself exclusively to the exposition of his social system. But Le Play, ever scrupulous, considered it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to make further journeys to <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, the Danube provinces, and Central Turkey (1848), Auvergne (1850), <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and Western <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (1851), <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> (1853). However, in 1855 he published "Les ouvriers europ&eacute;ens", describing the material and moral life of thirty-six <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, among widely different races, which he had studied at close range. The School of Le Play continues this series of valuable monographs in a periodical entitled "Les ouvriers des deux mondes". The <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economist</a> Higgs declared that Le Play's monographs on four <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> are the best available account of English popular life from the <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> point of view. Taine, the French historian, after studying the origins of contemporary <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for his great work, wrote: "By his methodical, exact, and profound researches, Le Play has done a great service to politics and, in consequence, to history." Luzzatti, a <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jew</a> who later became president of the Italian ministry, wrote to Le Play: "After drinking at all sources, I draw inspiration for my studies from your method alone." And it was in conformity with Le Play's method that Carroll D. Wright, head of the Boston Bureau of Statistics and later Commissioner of Labour at Washington, had 6000 monographs dealing with labour problems compiled; in acknowledging the influence of the study of Le Play, he says, "I received from it a new inspiration which completely changed the trend of my thoughts." Le Play had intended to add to "Les ouvriers europ&eacute;ens" a final chapter setting forth certain <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> conclusions, but at the last he held them back to let them mature, and simply wrote: "If required to point out the force which, operating at each extremity of the social scale, suffices, strictly speaking, to render a people prosperous, we should unhesitatingly answer: at the bottom, foresight; at the top, religion. In analysing facts and comparing figures, social <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> always leads real observers to the principles of the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">Divine law</a>." In 1856 Le Play founded the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'Economie Sociale with the intention of preparing public opinion to accept his conclusions.



<p>In 1855 (second period) <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a> appointed Le Play councillor of State and reposed in him a confidence which steadily increased. He also requested Le Play to write a book on the social principles which seemed to him requisite for the prosperity of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Le Play consented and, in 1864, published his "R&eacute;forme sociale en France, d&eacute;duite de l'observation compar&eacute;e des peuples europ&eacute;ens". In the first chapter, "La religion", he defends the religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> against Darwinism and Scepticism, but at that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the various <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> seemed to him but external forms, equally respectable and inspired by the same religious sentiment; he does not decide in favour of any. He defends <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, respects <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, but fails to appreciate the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. From his observations he concluded that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the original <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of man is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, that the tendency to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is ingrained in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, that, therefore, a law is needed to compel man to do good in order to attain <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and he hails this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a> but makes little account of the Gospel. The work was a sort of social apologetic for the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>: "the erring", he writes, "on whom the traditional <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> have no longer any influence, are led back by the facts which the method of observation brings to light." The book met with great success. Sainte-Beuve proclaimed him "a rejuvenated Bonald, progressive and scientific". <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a> wrote: "Le Play has produced the most original, most useful, most <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a>, and, in every respect, the strongest book of the century. He not only possesses more eloquence than the illustrious <a href="../cathen/14753a.htm">Tocqueville</a>, but much more practical perspicacity and above all greater moral <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. I repeat, what I admire most in him is the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> which impels him to fight with raised visor against most of the dominant prejudices of his time and country. In this, even more than in his prodigious <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of facts, will consist his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> greatness in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> history of the nineteenth century." <a href="../cathen/10699a.htm">Napoleon III</a> entrusted the organization of the Exposition Universelle of 1867 to Le Play, whom he made commissary general, and, at his request, the emperor created a new order of reward in favour of "establishments and localities throughout the world which give the best examples of social peace". But despite public opinion and the sympathy of the emperor, the jurists opposed Le Play's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> regarding testamentary liberty. As early as 1865 Baron de V&eacute;auce, a member of the <em>corps l&eacute;gislatif,</em> proposed that the Government should study the modification of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of inheritance, but his proposal received the votes of only forty-one deputies. The emperor, however, on two occasions had investigations made with a view to the establishment of testamentary freedom in favour of small holdings, but the project was opposed by the jurists and failed. In November, 1869, he urged Le Play to make another effort to win over five senators to this view, but this attempt, also, was unsuccessful.

<p>It was at the emperor's suggestion that, in January, 1870, Le Play in his "L'organisation du travail" gave a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the principles expounded in "La R&eacute;forme sociale". The emperor also asked him to present to two of his <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> the conclusions of this book as expressing the imperial opinion, but further action was prevented by the outbreak of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and the fall of the empire. In 1871, after the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and the Commune, Le Play published his book "L'organisation de la famille" and his pamphlet on "La paix sociale apr&egrave;s le d&eacute;sastre", and to propagate his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> he founded in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> "Unions de la paix sociale". His <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> met with little political success; the project laid before the National Assembly, 25 June, 1871, for the modification of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of inheritance was without result. Le Play grouped about him eminent economists such as Focillon, Claudio Jaunet, Cheysson, and Rostand. In 1875 he published "La Constitution de l'Angleterre"; in 1876, "La r&eacute;forme en <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> et le salut de la <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>"; in 1877-79, the second edition of his "Ouvriers europ&eacute;ens", which, enriched with new details, is a sort of compendium of the social history of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> from 1855; and in 1881, "La Constitution essentielle de l'humanit&eacute;". In 1881 also appeared the review, "La r&eacute;forme sociale", which, even today, propagates Le Play's <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>.

<p>The social <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> elaborated in his works is as follows: In all prosperous nations there are certain institutions which accompany and explain this prosperity. These institutions are; <ul><li>(1) the observance of the <a href="../cathen/04664a.htm">Decalogue</a>; <li>(2) public worship &mdash; on this point Le Play devotes some beautiful passages to the r&ocirc;le of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> (which he calls the model nation of our time), expresses his fear that the concordatory regime in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> will produce a Church of bureaucrats, and dreams of a liberty such as exists in America for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; <li>(3) testamentary freedom, which according to him distinguishes peoples of vigorous expansion while the compulsory division of inheritances is the system of conquered races and inferior classes. It is only, he asserts, under the former system that <em>familles-souches</em> can develop, which are established on the soil and are not afraid of being prolific; <li>(4) legislation punishing seduction and permitting the investigation of paternity; <li>(5) institutions founded by large land owners or industrial leaders to uplift the condition of the workman. Le Play feared the intervention of the State in the labour system and considered that the State should encourage the social authorities to exercise what he calls "patronage", and should reward the heads of industry who founded philanthropic institutions. The League for Social Service, organized at New York in 1898 by Mr. Tolman, applied these <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of Le Play; <li>(6) liberty of instruction, i.e. freedom from State control; <li>(7) decentralization in the State.</ul>

<p>He greatly admired the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of self-government. In his latest works the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> tendency becomes more and more clearly defined. Le Play desired to collaborate with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the work of social reform; he believed that fidelity to <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>, an essential need of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, could not be better guaranteed than by the doctrines, <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and worship of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. One of his last public acts was a proceeding in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> right to teach, which was threatened by the projects of M. Jules Ferry. He obtained from his friend <a href="../cathen/10407b.htm">St. George Mivart</a> a statement, signed by Gladstone, Lord Rosebery, and numerous professors of Oxford, Cambridge, and <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, regarding the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> and practice of liberty of instruction.

<p>Le Play was very influential in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> circles. In his <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> pastoral for 1881, <a href="../cathen/02674b.htm">Cardinal de Bonnechose</a> compared him to "those ancient sages of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> who went to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the most remote countries of the Orient, to glean from sanctuary to sanctuary the primitive traditions of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>". The future <a href="../cathen/09050d.htm">Cardinal Lavigerie</a> wrote to him, "You are one of the men whom I most respect and admire." Although the "&OElig;uvre des cercles catholiques ouvriers", founded in 1870 by the Comte de Mun and the Marquis de la Tour du Pin, held on the subject of the State's intervention in the labour system very different <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> from those of Le Play, the marquis claimed Le Play as one of his masters, because of the latter's attacks on Rousseau's theory of the original <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> of man and on the juridical and social <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of the men of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>.
