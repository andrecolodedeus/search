<h1>Pierre-Jean Beckx</h1>  

<p>Twenty-second General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, born at Sichem, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, 8 February, 1795; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 4 March, 1887. Father Beckx was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 7 March, 1819, and appointed to a little <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> near <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>; eight months afterwards he resigned this office and entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Having learned the <a href="../cathen/06517a.htm">German language</a>, he was soon able to preach, hear <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>, and give retreats in German. The Duke and Duchess of Anhalt-K&ouml;then were converted to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in 1825 and asked for a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>; Father Beckx was appointed to this <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, and went to live in Koethen. He found only 20 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> there; in four years he had 200 converts. In 1830 he went to live in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where he was the only <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> for many years. From time to time he was called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and sent on important missions to <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. In 1852 he was made Provincial of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and brought back the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> to <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>, <a href="../cathen/09273a.htm">Linz</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09144a.htm">Lemberg</a>. The next year, on the death of <a href="../cathen/13182a.htm">Father Roothaan</a>, he was made General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> by the unanimous vote of the delegates from all parts of the world. The new father-general brought to his office a deep spirit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; a profound <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the human heart; firmness and dignity; serenity of mind in extreme trial; faultless manners; and a remarkable soundness of judgment.

<p>During the thirty-four years that Father Beckx governed the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> its membership was doubled, new provinces were established in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and America; new missions were begun in different parts of the world; the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth was continued with success; new colleges were opened in every province. During his term of office, eighty <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were raised to the honors of the altar; all but three of these were missionaries or <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> was expelled from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in 1860, from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 1868, from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in 1873, from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the French colonies in 1880. In 1873 Father Beckx went to live at <a href="../cathen/06070a.htm">Fiesole</a> near <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, where he remained until the election of <a href="../cathen/01466a.htm">Father Anderledy</a> as Vicar-general, in 1883; then he went back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, abdicating his charge entirely. There, four years later, he died at the advanced age of ninety-two years. Father Beckx was the author of "Der Monat Maria," Vienna, 1838, which passed through thirty editions in German, and was translated into English, French, Italian, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, Polish, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, and Arabic.
