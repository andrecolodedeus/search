<h1>Pierre-Joseph Desault</h1>  

<p>Surgeon and anatomist, b. at Magny-Vernois a small town of Franche-Comt&eacute;, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1744; d. 1 June, 1795. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were poor and he received his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> from the Jesuits. He began his studies for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> but gave this up for the study of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a>. His means not permitting him to go to a regular <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of medicine he became an assistant to the barber-surgeon of his native village and then took a similar post at the military <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> of Belfort. His favourite studies were <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a> and mathematics and he applied mathematical principles to his anatomical investigations. Borelli had done this with excellent results and Desault translated Borelli's "De Motu Animalium" with notes and illustrations. He was not yet twenty when he went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> where, in 1766, after two years, he opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a>. So practical and thorough were his methods of teaching that he soon had three hundred students, many of them older than himself. In order to protect himself form professional jealousy, as he had no degree, he opened his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> under the name of a man already privileged to teach but whose name is not now known. Teaching brought him reputation but not much profit, and when in 1776 he was admitted to the Academy of Surgeons, he was allowed to pay his fees by instalments. In 1782 he became chief surgeon to the Charity Hospital and not long after surgeon to the H&ocirc;tel-Dieu. He was now looked upon as the most prominent surgeon in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and founded a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of clinical surgery which attracted students from all sides. In 1793 he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolutionary</a> authorities but after three days was liberated through the influence of his patients. He died from pneumonia, the result of exposure while attending the Dauphin in the Temple. He wrote a treatise on surgical operations in three volumes; a treatise on fractures and luxations, edited by Xavier Bichat, was published after his death and was translated into English in 1805 going through three American editions. Desault's contributions to surgery are contained in the "Journalde Chirurgie" published by himself and pupils.
