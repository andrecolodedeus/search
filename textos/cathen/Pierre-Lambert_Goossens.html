<h1>Pierre-Lambert Goossens</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> (Belgium), b. at Perck, near Vilvorde, 18 July, 1827; d. at <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, 25 January, 1906.

<p>After teaching at Bruel College at <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, he became, in 1856, <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curate</a> at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> and secretary of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, and, in April, 1078, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of <a href="../cathen/04665b.htm">Cardinal Dechamps</a>. Meanwhile he had been appointed (1860) an honorary canon of the metropolitan chapter. In 1880 he was made a Roman <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, and 24 June, 1883, was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> coadjutor-bishop to Mgr. Gravez whom he succeeded as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10679a.htm">Namur</a> 16 July following eight months later (24 March, 1884) he became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, and on 24 May, 1889, he was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of the Title of Santa-Croce in Gerusalemme. Succeeding to the See of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a> just when the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> were about to depose the <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Masonic</a> government which had oppressed them since 1879, he did much to perpetuate the strong hold on political power which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party has since possessed. In order to promote thorough <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sentiments among the workmen of the great industrial centres of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, also in distant country places he provided for them greater church facilities, caused many new churches to be built, and created eighty-six <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> in twenty-two years he founded in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> 840 primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, with an attendance of 120,000 children. He also multiplied high schools for girls and for boys, opened normal and professional <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and founded ten colleges for the teaching of humanities. Tireless in promoting the economical interests of the <a href="../cathen/08719a.htm">working</a> classes, he organized and presided over two general congresses and five district congresses in which the social question was the chief topic of discussion. On public occasions his manner was noble and stately, yet in his dealings with <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and people he was always amiable and unaffected, and had the secret of enlisting sacrifice and devotion. To kindness he joined <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and discretion and was thus able to avoid conflicts with the State authorities. A talented writer, his style bore the impression of the masterpieces of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> eloquence, of which he was an assiduous reader.

<p>In his "Charges and Pastoral Letters" (five volumes) and his "Occasional Addresses" accuracy of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, delicacy of feeling, literary tact, and purity of diction are always predominant characteristics. Though not himself a savant, he was alive to scientific needs, and greatly encouraged scientific progress in the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>, of which he was the chief patron. He reorganized the archives of his archdiocese and encouraged historical research among his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> by requiring each <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to furnish his with an historical monograph on his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>.

<p>His published works are: "Collectio Epistolarum pastoralium, decretorum, aliorumque documentorum" (5 vols., Mechlin, 1889-1906); "Discours sur la question sociale" (Mechlin, 1894); "Choix de conf&eacute;rences, discours et allocutions" (Mechlin, 1906).
