<h1>Pierre-Paul Royer-Collard</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">Philosopher</a> and French politician, b. at Sompuis (Marne), 21 June, 1763; d. at Ch&acirc;teauvieux (Loire et Cher), 4 September, 1845. An advocate under the ancient r&eacute;gime, and assistant registrar of the municipality of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> from 1790 till 1792, he withdrew to La Marne during the Terror. In 1797 he represented La Marne in the Council of the Five Hundred (<em>Cinq-Cents</em>) and became prominent through a celebrated discourse in which he demanded liberty for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, "which rallied under its ancient standards seven-eighths of the French people", and accused of "profound folly" those who wished to substitute "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> silliness". Driven from the council by the stroke of the 18 Fructidor, he turned to the restoration of the Bourbons and began a correspondence with Louis XVIII; he was even, up to 1804, a member of a secret council which sent messages to the future king. Under the empire he withdrew from public life, but accepted from <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> (December, 1809) the chair of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>. His teaching, which was influenced by the School of Reid, marked a reaction against the sensualism of the eighteenth century. He held to a certain spiritualism based on "common sense", and an "understanding of human weakness". Under the Restoration he again took up politics; he became deputy and was president for five years of the Committee of Public instruction as counsellor of state. As deputy he opposed both the intrigues of the Ultras, and the anti-constitutional manoeuvres of the Left. His discourses on the religious <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the epoch show that he was inclined to admit, as a consequence of the Concordat, the interference of the state in Church matters. Educated by a <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> mother, and declaring <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> that "whoever did not know Port-Royal did not know humanity", he preserved certain prejudices against Roman influence and gave expression to them in his discourses. He opposed the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> punishing sacrilege with death, and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> restraining the liberty of the Press. In 1827 he was elected by seven electoral colleges, became president of the Chamber in 1828, and presented to Charles X in 1830 the address of the two hundred and twenty-one in which the Chamber refused to accept Polignac. Royer-Collard described himself when he wrote to Barante (19 Sept., 1833): "my only vocation as a liberal was on the side of the Legitimists". For the "doctrinaires", of whom he was the head, the legitimist monarchy without liberty was an arbitrary absolutism, liberty without the legitimist monarchy, <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>. Under the monarchy of July he continued as deputy, but only as a spectator. The "Restoration" writes Barante, "was for him a country", and from 1830 this country no longer existed. He resigned from the Chamber in 1842, and passed his last years in retirement, but his disciples, both in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and politics &#151; Jouffroy, Cousin, Guizot, R&eacute;musat &#151; perpetuated the influence of certain of his writings; and M. Faguet declares that in these one must seek "the most penetrating, the most solid, and the most far-seeing <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on parliamentary government". This he developed with a grave, austere eloquence, trusting to <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> for its strength. Whilst during the first half of the nineteenth century the word "liberal" was generally synonymous with Voltaireanism and hostility to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, certain speeches of Royer-Collard quoted by Barante show that this liberal, especially in his later years, professed a deferential attachment for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. "If Christianity", he wrote, "has been a degradation, a corruption, Voltaire in attacking it has been a benefactor of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; but if the contrary be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, then the passing of Voltaire over the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> earth has been a great calamity." In a letter to <a href="../cathen/12667b.htm">P&egrave;re de Ravignan</a> he comments upon the institution of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> as a wonderful creation. His death was that of a professing and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. He was the incarnation of the upper middle class of his time. He was a member of the <a href="../cathen/01089a.htm">French Academy</a> from 1827.
