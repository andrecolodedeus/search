<h1>Pierre-Rose-Ursule-Dumoulin Borie</h1>  

<p>Bishop-elect of <a href="../cathen/01092a.htm">Acanthus</a>, <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Western Tongking and Martyr; b. 20 February, 1808, at Beynat, <a href="../cathen/15086c.htm">Diocese of Tulle</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; beheaded 24 November, 1838. He studied successively at the colleges of Beaulieu and Servieres, and in 1826 entered the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/15086c.htm">Tulle</a>. Meanwhile the desire to devoted his life to the evangelization of distant lands matured, and in 1829 he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and spent thirteen months at the Seminary of the Foreign Missions. Too young for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, he was to have been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at <a href="../cathen/12228c.htm">Pondicherry</a>, on his way to his missionary post. However, a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> permitted his immediate <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, which took place at <a href="../cathen/02358b.htm">Bayeux</a> (1830). He sailed from Havre, 1 December, 1830, and, after spending some time at <a href="../cathen/09481b.htm">Macao</a>, in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, arrived in Tongking in the year 1832. His progress in the language of the country was rapid, but eight months after his installation an edict of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was issued (January, 1833). Borie had to remain almost continually concealed and to endure great privations. In 1834, failing health increased the acuteness of the sufferings of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. He regained his strength the following year and was enabled to visit even the least accessible <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities of the vast district of which he was in charge. He fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutors</a> in 1838. During his captivity he received the news of his <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to the Vicariate Apostolic of Western Tongking, with Acanthus as <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular see</a>. Shortly after this, on the 24th of November, 1838, the death sentence was pronounced on him and two native <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; the execution took place that same day. His remains were brought to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1843, and are religiously kept at the Seminary of the Foreign Missions, in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The cause of his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> has been introduced at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.
