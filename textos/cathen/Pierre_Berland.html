<h1>Pierre Berland</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, b. 1375 in M&eacute;doc; d. 1457 at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>. Being of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> extraction, it was only through the liberality of friends that he was able to study the humanities at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> and canon law at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he was, first, secretary to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, then canon of St. Andrew's, and afterwards <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Soliac. In 1430 he was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>. During his incumbency, he took a great interest in <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> matters, founded the <a href="../cathen/02684a.htm">University of Bordeaux</a>, endowed St. Raphael's College with twelve scholarships for indigent students, and in general won the character of a highly cultured and saintly <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>. His position as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was most delicate. During the Hundred Years' War, the province of Guyenne had showed marked preference for the English Crown. On the other hand, the conduct of the English toward <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Joan of Arc</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> shortly after Berland's preferment, coupled with the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of Henry VI, who had himself solemnly <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, could not meet the approval of the worthy <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Twice he went north in an endeavour to bring his suzerain to greater moderation. Having failed in this, he transferred his allegiance to Charles VII, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and was instrumental in bringing about the submission of the whole province to the French Crown, and with the termination of the Hundred Years' War. Berland, old and inform, resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1457 and died shortly afterwards, <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> by his people. His remains were laid at rest in the vault of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and his name is yet <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>. The tower he caused to be built at St. Andrew's church in 1440, is called in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> "Pey Berland" or "Pere Berland" even to this day. Louis XI had obtained from <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> the appointment of a commission with a view towards Berland's <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a>, but the cause fell through at that prince's death. This fact, coupled with the veneration of the people, accounts for the appellation "Bienheureux Berland" by which he is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.
