<h1>Pierre Bertrand</h1>  

<p>(1) A <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, and canonist, b. 1280 at Annonay in Vivarais; d. 1348 or 1349 at the Priory of Montaud, near <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. His noble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parentage</a> is known to us through the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> memoir of Grasset, a Celestine <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> of the seventeenth century (Discours g&eacute;n&eacute;alogique de la noble maison de Bertrand et de leur alliance aven celle de Colombier). The legal profession seems to have been the first aim of his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> He successively studied and taught law in the Universities of <a href="../cathen/02160a.htm">Avignon</a>, Montepellier, <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. Prized as one of the best law-regents of his day, he soon reached high positions in the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, the King's Council, and the Queen's Chancery. His definite calling lay, however, in another direction, and he became a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> career was no less brilliant than his legal success. We find him in rapid succession Dean of Puy-en-Valais, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10778a.htm">Nevers</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>. In 1331 <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> made him a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in recognition of many services rendered to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Among these services are to be reckoned several <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> founded at Annonay, and the Coll&egrave;ge d'Autun, or Coll&egrave;ge Cardinal, established in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> on behalf of fifteen poor students, five for <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, five for law, and five for the <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a>. Bertrand's best title to recognition is, however, his defence of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> both by word of mouth and also with his pen. Fournier, in his "Officialiti&eacute;s du moyen-&acirc;ge" (Paris, 1880), points out, at the beginning of the Valois dynasty, a strong tendency of the State towards curtailing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> traditional <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. In 1329 took place the famous "Conf&eacute;rence de Vincennes", where Pierre de Cugnieres, speaking for Philippe de Valois, bitterly complained of undue extension of <a href="../cathen/12437a.htm">ecclesiastical privileges</a> (e.g., the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> for the sole purpose of enjoying the <em>privilegium fori; causes des veuves</em>, or <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> causes drawn to <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical courts</a>; the free use of censures to enforce the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> privileges; appeals to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> form the decision of civil courts, etc.). Pierre Bertrand, then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, was the principal spokesman of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. He replied in a spirit of conciliation to all charges bearing on minor points, but strongly upheld what he considered the essential <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Following on the lines of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Unam Sanctam" of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, he summed up his plea in four statements; (1) the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a> is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; (2) yet, it is not by itself sufficient for the government of the people, for which <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> is also required; (3) although nothing prevents the two powers from being in the same hands; (4) still, whether in the same or different hands, they stand in a certain relation of subordination, the spiritual power being the higher of the two. His views are to be found in "Libellus adversus Petrum de Cugneriis" and "De origine et usu jurisdictionum", published in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1495 and 1584 respectively, and later inserted in volume XIV of the "Magna Bibliotheca Veterum Patrum" (Cologne, 1618). Many other writings of Cardinal Bertrand (apologetical, canonical, pastoral) have not been published and are reported to be in the Vatican Library.

<p>(2) <em>Bertrand, Pierre, de Colombier</em> (also known as <em>Bertrand Pierre</em>), a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, nephew of the foregoing, whose name he adopted, b. in 1279, at Colombier in Vivarais; d. in 1361 at the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of Montaud, near <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. Like his uncle, he studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and occupied important positions in the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he soon rose to distinction, became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10778a.htm">Nevers</a>, then of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a>, later of <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a>, and was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a>, 1344. His career as a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> was a distinguished one. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> used him as their trusted agent in many delicate missions, notably for the termination of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and the election of Charles of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> to the imperial throne. He met little success in his endeavour to stop the Hundred Years' War, but brought about the desired election of Charles IV, and, having in the meantime become Dean of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, was naturally chosen by <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a> to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and crown the new emperor. Cardinal de Colombier left no writings. The Celestine <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Colombier and Montaud, whose benefactor he was, held his and his uncle's memory in great veneration. We are indebted to them for many biographical details on the two Cardinals Bertrand.
