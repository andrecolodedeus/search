<h1>Pierre Brugi&egrave;re</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a>, and Juror, born at Thiers, 3 October, 1730; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 7 November, 1803. He was <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a> and canon in his native place when his refusal to sign the formula of the acceptation of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a> forced him to leave. He went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> where for twelve years he remained with the community of <a href="../cathen/13100c.htm">St. Roch</a>. A strongly <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> book which he wrote, "Instructions catholiques sur la d&eacute;votion au Sacre-Coeur" (Paris, 1777), brought this connection to an end. When the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> broke out he welcomed it with enthusiasm. He rushed headlong into the fray with two books calling loudly for reform: "Dol&eacute;ances des &eacute;glisiers" and "Relation sommaire et v&eacute;ritable de ce qui s'est pass&eacute; dans l'Assembl&eacute;e du clerg&eacute;" (1789).

<p>Brugi&egrave;re not only took the Constitutional Oath on the day fixed, 9 Jan., 1791, but he became as it were the heart and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the Constitutional Church. Elected <em>cur&eacute;</em> of St. Paul's he defended the civil constitution of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> against episcopal and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> censures in his "Discours patriotique au sujet des brefs du pape" and "La lanterne sourde" (aimed at <a href="../cathen/02646b.htm">Bonal</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>). It is to his credit, however, that he energetically condemned the marriage of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> which the Constitution was doing its utmost to encourage. Against this practice he wrote his "R&eacute;flexions d'un cur&eacute;", and "Lettre d'un cur&eacute;" (1791), and together with several other constitutionals he denounced its advocates without mercy in "Le nouveau disciple de Luther" (1792). This brochure was aimed at Aubert, a married <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> appointed by Gobel <em>cur&eacute;</em> of St. Augustin. Brugi&egrave;re's fearless preaching placed him in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolutionary</a> tribunal, and it was while he was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> he wrote to his followers the "Lettre d'un cure du fond de sa prison &agrave; ses paroissiens" (1793). Set at liberty, he continued his pastoral ministrations in spite of the charge of treasonable conduct, a dangerous thing in those days. But his ministrations were of a novel kind. Mass was said and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were administered by him in French, and in support of that singularity an appeal was made to the people, "Appel au peuple francais" (1798)

<p>Brugi&egrave;re had rebuked the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who condemned the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. He had likewise rebuked the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who married. Now he was no less violent against the Jurors who began to retract. He attended the two councils of 1797 and 1801 which were trying hard to sustain the ebbing life of the Constitutional Church, and he founded a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for its protection: "Soci&eacute;t&eacute; de philosophie chr&eacute;tienne". Even after the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a> he clung to the then dead Constitutional Church. Besides the works already mentioned, Brugi&egrave;re wrote a number of pamphlets and left many sermons which were published after his death: "Instructions choisies" (Paris, 1804). Two contemporaries, the Abb&eacute; Massy and the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Christian Brother</a> Renaud, wrote his life under the title: "M&eacute;moire apolog&eacute;tique de Pierre Brugi&egrave;re" (Paris, 1804).
