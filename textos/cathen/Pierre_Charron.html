<h1>Pierre Charron</h1>  

<p>Moralist, b. in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1541; d. there 6 Nov., 1603. He studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, but after several years' practice he embraced the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>. For thirty years he preached with so much success that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> vied with one another to engage his services. Queen Margaret of Navarre entertained him as her preacher in ordinary, and King Henry delighted to hear him even before his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. In <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> he met the famous Michel de Montaigne. Their acquaintance ripened into a close and lasting friendship. Montaigne bequeathed to his friend the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to wear his <a href="../cathen/07243a.htm">coat of arms</a>, and Charron in return made the sister of Montaigne heir to his possessions. Charron published three books: "Les trois v&eacute;rit&eacute;s" (Bordeaux, 1594), "Les discours chrestiens" (Cahors, 1600), and "Sagesse" (Bordeaux, 1601). Whilst engaged in bringing out a second edition of the latter, he died suddenly of apoplexy.

<p>At a period of extraordinary religious agitation the "Trois v&eacute;rit&eacute;s" (Three Truths) proved to be a very opportune and valuable apology. The "Discours chrestiens" were published only a few months before "Sagesse", and, like "Trois v&eacute;rit&eacute;s", they were perfectly <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. But the book which carried Charron's influence and fame beyond the borders of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and down to our time is his "Sagesse". Its rich material, which Charron had gathered chiefly from Montaigne's conversations and essays, he divides into three parts: the nature of man; the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of man as man; and the particular <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of the various classes and conditions of men. His standpoint is invariably that of a human <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. The sceptic spirit which pervades the whole book allows it to be summed up in a very few words: by his own natural light and strength man is incapable of finding principles of religion and morality sufficiently certain; and, being sure of nothing, it is consequently wise to live as conveniently and pleasurably as the common usage of the people among whom one lives allows. No attempt is made anywhere in the body of the book to conceal the baldness of this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>.

<p>Had Charron, instead of engraving his easy-going "Je ne s&ccedil;ay" as the essence of all his worldly wisdom on the title-page of his "Sagesse" and over the entrance of his house, taken, like <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a>, the time and the trouble of finding a solid basis of moral and religious <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, he would have shown himself a deeper and more independent <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and a worthier moralist. As it is, we need not wonder that the second edition of the "Sagesse" encountered great opposition and was allowed to appear only after some passages had been softened down, and others explained or corrected. Nor is the fierce onslaught of Garasse, who called Charron "<em>ath&eacute;e et le patriarche des esprits forts</em>", surprising, especially when, even in our days, nearly the same charge is made and ably supported by Ad. Franck in the "Dictionnaire des <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> philosophiques". These accusations, however, take account neither of the time in which Charron lived, when philosophic uncertainty was not held to imply clearly the rejection of revealed authority; nor of the author's explicit professions that he intended his "Sagesse" as the best introduction to his "Trois v&eacute;rit&eacute;s" and his "Discours chrestiens"; nor of the constant good opinion in which the author was held to the end of his life by his many <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors.
