<h1>Pierre Coton</h1>  

<p>A celebrated <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, born 7 March, 1564, at N&eacute;ronde in Forez; died 19 March, 1626, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Bourges, entered the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> at the age of twenty-five, and was sent to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> to study <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Here he became acquainted with <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>. On his return to his native country he preached with remarkable success at Roanne, <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, <a href="../cathen/11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a>, <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>; An acquaintance with Henry IV of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> soon ripened into friendship, and the Archbishopric of Arles being vacant, the king offered it to Father Coton, who refused the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. The king having recalled the exiled <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, their enemies could not pardon the influence Father Coton had in bringing this about, and an attempt was made to assassinate him. Some writers have pretended that Father Coton was not above suspicion on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of regicide, and when Henry IV was assassinated, they accused Father Coton of defending Ravaillac, the king's murderer. But if his enemies at court had any <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that he held such views they failed to make it public.

<p>Father Coton had for two years previous to the death of Henry been confessor to his son, the young Dauphin. In 1610 the biting satire "Anti-Coton, o&ugrave; est prouv&eacute; que les J&eacute;suites sont coupables du parricide d'Henri IV" was followed by many pamphlets for and against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. It was an easy task for Father Coton to defend himself against these <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> and produce <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of his innocence, but very difficult for the author of the <a href="../cathen/09210a.htm">libel</a>, who was said to be Pierre Dumoulin, a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> minister of Charenton, and an associate of the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, to substantiate any statement that he had advanced. Father Coton was continued in his capacity as confessor to the new king, Louis XIII, which <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> he discharged until 1617, when he left the court at the age of fifty-four and withdrew to the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. He then traversed the provinces of the South as a missionary, and went to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, Loreto, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> the reigning king had made to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles</a>, and St. Peter. He returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> and preached at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in the church of S. Gervaise, whither the king and the whole court flocked to hear him. Just at this period a book published by Santarelli, an <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, who attributed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the power of deposing kings who were guilty of certain crimes, and under such circumstances of absolving their subjects from their allegiance, was the object of severe attacks from the many enemies of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>The doctrines which Santarelli expounded had been unwisely accepted in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and were still further professed by the Ultramontane <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, although they had become impossible in practice. This book, which in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was received in its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light, was in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, under the rule of <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu</a>, construed into a provocation to regicide and rebellion. These <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> views were attributed to every member of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, and the Parliament demanded that all <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> residing in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> should be called upon to sign a protestation disavowing all the doctrines contained in Santarelli's treatise. Father Coton was ill at the time, and the news conveyed to him aggravated his condition. On his death-bed he was visited by an envoy of Parliament, who informed him of the condemnation pronounced against Santarelli and the severe measures that threatened his brethren. The dying <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> murmured: "Is it possible that I who have served so faithfully the Kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> should be looked upon at last as guilty of treason and a disturber of the peace?" His "Institution catholique" and "Gen&egrave;ve plagiaire" are controversial works, as also his "Sacrifice de la Messe". For his other works see <a href="../cathen/02190c.htm">De Backer</a>, 1st ed;, II, p. 149.
