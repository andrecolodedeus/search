<h1>Pierre Gassendi</h1>  

<p>(GASSENDY, GASSEND.)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and scientist; b. at Champtercier, a country place near Digne in Provence, 22 January, 1592 (tombstone says IX cal. Feb., i.e. 24 Jan.); d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 24 October, 1655. He studied Latin and rhetoric at <a href="../cathen/04793a.htm">Digne</a>, and philosophy at <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, whence his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, Antoine* called him back to take charge of domestic affairs. However he was appointed to succeed his former teacher of rhetoric at <a href="../cathen/04793a.htm">Digne</a> at the age of 16, and his teacher of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> at <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a> at the age of 19. His friends and patrons at <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, Prior Gautier and Councillor Peiresc, recognized his character and talents from his first publication and helped him to enter the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>. He became doctor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a> and attained proficiency in Greek and Hebrew literature. To allow him leisure for his studies, he was appointed a canon (c. 1623) and <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> (c. 1625) at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/04793a.htm">Digne</a>. Until 1645, his studies were interrupted only by a journey to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> in 1628 &#151; his only trip outside of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1645, on the recommendation of <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal Richelieu</a>, he was appointed by the king to a professorship of mathematics at the College Royal of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, which he reluctantly accepted, being granted the rare privilege of returning to his native soil whenever his health required it. On 23 November, he delivered his inaugural address in presence of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. His lectures before a numerous and learned audience were <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> rather than mathematical, and resulted, two years later, in the publication of "Institutio Astronomica". Meanwhile an inflammation of the lungs had <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> him to return to Provence. In 1653, he went back to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and was received in a friendly manner at the Chateau de Monmort, where a year later he fell seriously ill with intermittent fever. He was bled nine times, and, although he declared himself too weak for another bleeding, he submitted to the decision of the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He underwent the same operation five times more, after which his speech became mere whispering, and he expired quietly at the age of 63.

<p>Gassendi, "the Bacon of France", is specially note-worthy for his opposition to the <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> philosophy, and for his revival of the Epicurean system. He wished the aprioristic methods then prevailing in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> replaced by experimental <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>. His <a href="../cathen/04413a.htm">cosmology</a>, <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a>, and ethics are epicurean, except that he maintains the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Creator and of Providence, and the spirituality and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. He thus attempts to build up a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> philosophy upon <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>--an inconsistency which is attacked by non-Christian, as well as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. His views on the constitution of matter and his merits in regard to modern kinetic <a href="../cathen/02053a.htm">atomism</a> are explained by Lasswitz. That Gassendi was neither "the father of materialism" nor a sceptic in the proper sense is shown by Kiefi (see Baldwin, op. cit. below). He corresponded with Hobbes, <a href="../cathen/10209b.htm">Mersenne</a>, Christina of Sweden, and engaged in controversy with Fludd, Herbert, and <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a>.

<p>That as an amateur <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomer</a>, Gassendi was a persevering, attentive, and intelligent observer, is evident from his notebook carefully kept from 1618 until 1652 and filling over 400 pages. With a <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galilean</a> telescope he observed the transit of Mercury in 1631, predicted by Kepler, by projecting the sun's image on a screen of paper. His instrument was not strong enough, however, to disclose the occultations and transits of Jupiter's satellites, or the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> shape of Saturn's ring. The results of his <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> work are analysed in Delambre's "Histoire de l'Astronomie Moderne" (Paris, 1821, II). Other works of minor importance refer to biographies, physics, and <a href="../cathen/01457e.htm">anatomy</a>. Gassendi was in correspondence with <a href="../cathen/03405b.htm">Cassini</a>, <a href="../cathen/06342b.htm">Galilei</a>, Hevel, Kepler, Scheiner, Vallis, and other scientists. As to the <a href="../cathen/04352b.htm">Copernican</a> system, he maintained that it rested on probabilities, but was not demonstrated, although he ably refuted all objections against it. To those whose <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> forbade them to accept <a href="../cathen/04352b.htm">Copernicanism</a>, he said that the Tychonian system recommended itself as the most probable of all (Op. V, De Rebus Caelestibus, V).

<p>In character, Gassendi was retiring and unpretentious. With friends, he would give way to a humorous and ironical vein; in controversy, he observed the <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socratic</a> method. On <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feast days he never omitted celebrating Mass; and when in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he went to the church of his friend, <a href="../cathen/10209b.htm">P&egrave;re Mersenne</a>. In his last illness he asked for the <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Viaticum</a> three times and for extreme unction, and his aspirations were words from the Psalms. Gassendi was esteemed by all, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> by the poor for whom he provided in lifetime and in his last will. He founded two anniversary Masses for himself, one to be said in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/04793a.htm">Digne</a>, and one in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of his friend, Monmort, at St-Nicolas-des-champs, Paris, where he was buried. The accompanying picture represents his marble bust in that mausoleum. The assertion that he was a <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorite</a> is without foundation.

<p>Gassendi's "Opera Omnia" were edited in 6 vols., Lyons, 1658, and Florence, 1727.
