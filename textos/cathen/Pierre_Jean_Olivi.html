<h1>Pierre Jean Olivi</h1>  

<p>(PETRUS JOHANNIS)

<p>A Spiritual <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> author, born at S&eacute;rignan, Diocese of B&eacute;ziers, 1248-9; died at Narbonne, 14 March, 1298. At twelve he entered the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> at B&eacute;ziers, and later took the baccalaureate at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, Returning to his native province, he soon distinguished himself by his strict observance of the rule and his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. When <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> prepared his <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> "Exiit" (1279), Olivi, then at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was asked to express his opinion with regard to <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> poverty (<em>usus pauper</em>). Unfortunately there was then in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of Provence a controversy about the stricter or laxer observance of the rule. Olivi soon became the principal spokesman of the rigorists, and met with strong opposition on the part of the community. At the General Chapter of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a> (1282) he was accused of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and henceforward almost every general chapter concerned itself with him. His <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was examined by seven <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, graduates of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> (see Anal. Franc., III, 374-75), and censured in thirty-four propositions, whereupon his writings were confiscated (1283). Olivi cleverly defended himself in several responses (1283-85), and finally the General Chapter of <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a> (1287) decided in his favour, The new general, Matthew of Aquasparta, sent him as <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Sta. Croce, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, whence Matthew's successor, Raymond Gaufredi, sent him as <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> to Montpellier. At the General Chapter of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1292) Olivi again gave explanations, which were apparently satisfactory. He spent his last years in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Narbonne. and died, surrounded by his friends, after an earnest profession of his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> (published by <a href="../cathen/15521d.htm">Wadding</a> ad a. 1297, n. 33).

<p>Peace, however, was not obtained by his death. His friends, <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> and seculars, showed an exaggerated veneration for their leader, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> as that of a saint; on the other hand the General Chapter of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> (1299) ordered his writings to be collected and burnt as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. The General Council of Vienne (1312), in the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a> "Fidei catholic&aelig; fundamento" (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Franc., V, 86), established the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> against three points of Olivi's teaching, without mentioning the author; these points referred to: <ul><li>(1) the moment <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord's</a> body was transfixed by the lance, <li>(2) the manner in which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is united to the body, <li>(3) the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of infants.</ul>

<p>In 1318 the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> went so far as to destroy Olivi's <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, and in the next year two further steps were taken against him: his writings were absolutely forbidden by the General Chapter of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, and a special commission of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> examined Olivi's "Postilla in Apocalypsim" and marked out sixty sentences, chiefly joachimistical extravagances. (See <a href="../cathen/08406c.htm">JOACHIM OF FLORA</a>. For text see <a href="../cathen/02242a.htm">Baluzius</a>-<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Miscellanea", II, <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, 1761, 258-70; cf. also <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, "Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis", II, i, Paris, 1891, 238-9) . It was only in 1326 that those sentences were really condemned by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, when the fact that Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> used Olivi's writings in his famous Appeal of Sachsenhausen (1324) had again drawn attention to the author. Olivi's fate was a hard one, but was partly deserved through his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> incorrectness. Still Father Ehrle, the most competent judge on this point, considers (Archiv, III, 440) that Olivi was not the impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> he is <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in some writings of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, and states (ibid., 448) that the denunciation of his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was rather a tactical measure of the adversaries of the severe principles of poverty and reform professed by Olivi. For the rest, Olivi follows in many points the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>. The numerous but for the most part unedited works of Olivi are appropriately divided by Ehrle into three classes: <ul><li>(1) Speculative Works, of which the chief is his "Qu&aelig;stiones" (philosophical and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>), printed partly in an extremely rare edition (Venice, 1509), which contains also his defences against the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of 1283-85 which were reprinted by Du Plessis d'Argentr&eacute;, "Collectio judiciorum", I (Paris, 1724), 226-34; Commentary on the Book of Sentences; "De Sacramentis" etc. <li>(2) Exegetical Works: Five small treatises on principles of introduction, printed under St. Bonaventure's name by Bonelli, "Suppl. ad. op. S. Bonaventur&aelig;" (Trent, 1772-3), I, 23-49, 282-347, 348-74; II, 1038-52, 1053-1113. In the same work (I, 52-281) is printed Olivi's "Postilla in Cant. Canticorum". (See S. Bonav. opera., VI, Quaracchi, 1893, Prolegomena, vi-ix.) The other <em>postill&oelig;</em> are: Super Genesim, Job, <a href="../cathen/12543b.htm">Psalterium</a>, Proverbia, Ecclesiasten, Lamentationes Jeremi&aelig;, Ezechielem, Prophetas minores, on the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a>, Ep. ad Romanos [see <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, "Die Abendl. Schriftausleger bis Luther . . . . (Romans 1:17) und justificatio" (Mainz, 1905), 156 sq.], ad Corinthios, in epistolas Canonicas, in Apocalypsim; <li>(3) Works on observance of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Rule (see <a href="../cathen/06208a.htm">RULE OF SAINT FRANCIS</a>).</ul>
