<h1>Pierre Olivaint</h1>  

<p>Pierre Olivaint was born in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 22 Feb., 1816. His father, a man of repute but an unbeliever, and embittered by reverses of fortune and career, died in 1835 without having returned to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He was survived by his wife, also without religion, and three children. At twenty Pierre left home, and the College of Charlemagne, where he had made a brilliant course of studies, imbued him with the doctrines of Voltaire. His heart, however, had remained remarkably pure, and he writes at this time: "I desire, if by any possibility I should become a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, to be a missionary, and if I am a missionary to be a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>." In 1836, Pierre entered the Normal School, and, where so many lose their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, conversion awaited him. Led away at first by Buchez's neo-Catholicism, then won by the sermons of Lecordaire, he made his profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/12667b.htm">Father Ravignan (</a>1837), and from that time became an apostle. At the Normal School he formed a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> group which by its <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and charity soon attracted attention and respect. The Conferences of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a> attracted the &eacute;lite of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and Olivaint with twelve of his companions established them in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Saint M&eacute;nard. By the ardour of their charity and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, these heroic youths symbolized the religious renaissance in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1836, Olivaint heard that Lecordaire was going to restore the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Several of his friends had already decided to follow the great orator. He wished to follow him also, but was detained by the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of supporting his mother. After a year of professorship at <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, he returned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and occupied the chair of history at Bourbon College; in 1841 he accepted a position as tutor to the young George de la Rochefoucaud.

<p>In 1842 Olivaint won the junior fellowship in a history competition. His lecture was on <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, and M. Saint-Marc Girardin closed the assembly with these words: "We have just heard virtue, pleading the cause of virtue". At this time <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was declared against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Quinet and Michelet changed their lectures into impassioned lectures against the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. On 2 May, 1845, <a href="../cathen/14635b.htm">M. Thiers</a> was to conduct before the assembly an interpellation against these religious. Olivaint saw that it was his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to be present. "I hesitated" he said to <a href="../cathen/15394b.htm">Louis Veuillot</a>, "I hesitate no longer. <a href="../cathen/14635b.htm">M. Thiers</a> shows me my <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. I must follow it. I enter today." And the day of the proposed interpellation he entered the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of Laval. This sacrifice was hard for Madame Olivaint who as yet had not been converted by the virtues of her son. After a year's fervent <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> he was made professor of history at the College of Brugelette, in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. On 3 May, 1847, he made his first <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and on the completion of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies he received <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>. In the meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1850 had established, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the right of controlling <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Pierre Olivaint was summoned to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he remained. On 3 May, 1852, Pierre arrived at the College of Vaugirard of which the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had accepted charge. He was to spend thirteen years here, first as professor and prefect of studies, and then as <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>. A model teacher, he trained the heart as well as the mind, and by his exhaustless energy, added to the direction of his college, many works of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, among others, "L'oeuvre de L'Enfant J&eacute;sus pour la pr&egrave;miere communion des juenes filles pauvres", and "L'oeuvre de Saint Fran&ccedil;ois-Xavier" for the workmen of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Vaugirard.

<p>After twenty-five years devoted to teaching, Father Olivaint was named Superior of the House in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1965). He accepted this burden with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and displayed an unbounded <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. An indefagitable preacher and director, he exercised by his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and irresistible influence over all. His mother yielded to him, and under his direction Madame Olivaint prepared by a life of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for a very holy death. In the meantime, a spirit of revolt agitated <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and spread throughout <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The religious renaissance of the nineteenth century, in which Pierre Olivaint had been an example, called forth a retaliation of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. In January, 1870, Father Olivaint wrote, "Persecution is upon us; it will be terrible; we will pass through torrents of blood." On the desertion of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the emperor had followed the disaster of the French troops. The investment of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> was planned, and to those who advised him to fly, he replied that he was the post of danger. The most formidable danger pending was the commune, now mistress of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. "Let us be generous and ready for sacrifice" said Father Olivaint. "France must have the blood of the pure to raise her again; which one of us indeed, is worthy to offer his life, and what a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, should we be chosen." He was chosen. On 4 April, 1871, the <em>f&eacute;d&eacute;r&eacute;s</em> arrested <a href="../cathen/04634b.htm">Mgr Darboy</a> and several others. On the fifth, they took possession of the house on the Rue de S&egrave;vres and Father Olivaint quietly gave himself up. On 24 May, <a href="../cathen/04634b.htm">Mgr Darboy</a> and five other <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> were executed; on the twenty-sixth, fifty-two victims, Father Olivaint marching at their head, were dragged through <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and massacred in the Rue Haxo. The day after this expiation the commune was overthrown. The remains of Father Olivaint and the four <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who fell with him (Fathers Ducoudray, Caubert, Clere, and <a href="../cathen/02479a.htm">de Bengy</a>) were placed in a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in the Rue de S&egrave;vres, where the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> faithful still continue to invoke them, and numberless <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> have been attributed to their intercession.
