<h1>Pierre Pithou</h1>  

<p>A writer, born at <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, 1 Nov. 1539; died at Nogent-sur-Seine, 1 Nov., 1596. His father, a distinguished lawyer, had secretly embraced <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>. Pierre studied the classics in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> under Turn&egrave;be, and afterwards with his brother, Fran&ccedil;ois Pithou, attended lectures in law at <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> and <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a> under Cujas, who often said: <em>Pith&oelig;i fratres, clarissima lumina.</em> In 1560 he was admitted to practise at the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> bar; but on the outbreak of the second <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of religion, he withdrew to Troyes. Not being admitted to the bar at <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a> on account of his <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, he withdrew to Sedan which was a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> district, and, at the request of the Duc de Bouillon, he codified the legal customs into the form of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. He then proceeded to Basle, where he published Otto de Freisingen's "Vie de Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Barberousse" and Warnfrid's" Historia Miscellanea". After the Edict of Pacification of 1570 he returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, escaped during the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, and, in 1573, joined the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the struggles between the future Henry IV and the League. he was an ardent adherent of Henry; he collaborated in the production of the "Satire M&eacute;nipp&eacute;e", and being skilled in canon law, made a study, in an anonymous letter published in 1593, of the right of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to absolve Henry IV without consulting the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In 1594 he published an epoch-making work "Les libert&eacute;s de l'&eacute;glise gallicane". For the first time the maxims of Gallicanism were really codified, in eighty-three articles, The first edition was dedicated to Henry IV. The permission to publish the edition of 1651 under <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> contains these words: "We wish to show our favour to a work of so great importance for the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of our crown". Pithou's book was the basis of the Four Articles of 1682. D'Aguesseau declared that the book was "the palladium of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>", President H&eacute;nault, that "the maxims of Pithou have in a sense the force of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>". An edict of 1719, and a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Parliament of Dauphin&eacute; on 21 April, 1768, ordered the enforcement of certain articles in Pithou's book, as if these eighty-three articles were legal enactments. They were reprinted by Dupin in 1824.

<p>Henry IV appointed Pithou <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> general of the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; but he soon resigned the post, preferring to return to his juristic and literary studies. He edited Salvian, Quintilian, Petronius, Ph&aelig;drus, the Capitularies of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, and the "Corpus juris canonici". His brother Fran&ccedil;ois (1541-1621), who <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in 1578, wrote in 1587 a treatise on "The greatness of the rights, and of the preeminence of the kings and the kingdom of France", and was distinguished for his fanatical hostility to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. Pierre Pithou, more equitable, saved the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> from some of the dangers that threatened them for a short time after the attempted assassination of Henry IV by Ch&acirc;tel.
