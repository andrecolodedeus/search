<h1>Pierre d'Ailly</h1>  

<p>(PETRUS DE ALLACO).

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, born 1350 at Compi&egrave;gne; died probably 1420 at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. He studied at the College of Navarre, <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. In 1375, by his commentaries on the Sentences of <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a>, he furthered the cause of <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. He received the degree of Doctor of Theology in 1380. At that time he wrote several treatises, in which he maintained, among other doctrines, that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> hold their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, that the Pope is inferior to a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>, that neither the Pope nor the council is strictly <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallible</a>, but only the universal <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1384 he became director of the College of Navarre; <a href="../cathen/06530c.htm">Gerson</a> and <a href="../cathen/04011b.htm">Nicholas of Clemanges</a> were among his pupils. He acquired great fame by his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>, writings, and discussions. The University having censured several propositions of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> John of Monzon, who denied the <a href="../cathen/07674d.htm">Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin</a>, the latter appealed to <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>. In behalf of the University, d'Ailly was sent to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> as the head of a delegation, and finally (1389) persuaded <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement</a> to maintain the condemnation. The same year d'Ailly was made Chancellor of the University, Confessor of the King, and Treasurer of the Sainte Chapelle. When <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> succeeded <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, d'Ailly's influence <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be recognized at the French court. He was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09185b.htm">Le Puy</a> in 1395, and in 1397 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a>. He was very active in trying to solve the principal question of the day, the ending of the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">great schism</a>. He proposed the assembling of a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> &#151; an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> which he had suggested in a sermon as early as 1381 &#151; and endeavored to bring the two Popes to resign. On account of <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict's</a> hesitations and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> promises, d'Ailly withdrew more and more from the Avignon Pope, and when, in 1398, the French King recalled his submission, d'Ailly approved this action. Later, however, he counseled obedience, though only in essential matters, and this course having been accepted by the Council of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he announced it in a sermon in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Notre Dame (1403). At the Council of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a> (Jan., 1409) d'Ailly again advocated the necessity of a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>, he claimed, does not depend on the unity of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, but on that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has a natural and divine right to its unity and self-preservation; hence it can, even without the Pope's sanction, assemble in a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. A few months later, in fact, the <a href="../cathen/12112b.htm">Council of Pisa</a> was convoked, in which both Popes were <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>, and a third, <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Alexander V</a>, was elected, thus complicating the difficulty. In 1411 d'Ailly was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by Alexander's successor, <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>, and assisted at the Council of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1412). In 1414 the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> was convoked, and was successful in ending the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> by the election of <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a> (1418). D'Ailly took a leading part in the council and presided at its third session (March 26, 1415). He insisted on several principles, some of which had been developed already in his earlier writings. The council, he said, having been duly convoked, could not now be dissolved by any action of the Pope; as its power came from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> immediately, all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, and the Pope himself, were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to submit to its decisions. He favored the method of voting by nations and the extension of the power of voting to the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and of canon law, and to the princes and their <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>. These were complete departures from the practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. After the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a>, d'Ailly was appointed by <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V's</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, where he died.

<p>D'Ailly enjoyed considerable celebrity among his contemporaries, who gave him the titles of <em>Aquila Franciae, et aberrantium a veritate malleus indefessus</em> (The eagle of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the indefatigable hammer of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>). If his principles concerning the power in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are exaggerated and, in fact, they have been condemned since &#151; they should be considered with reference to the condition of those times when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was divided under two heads. In many respects d'Ailly reproduces the theses of Occam and the <a href="../cathen/11090c.htm">Nominalists</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a> cannot be strictly demonstrated, that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Trinity cannot be established from the Scriptures, that positive law is the only basis of morality, etc. In many instances he shows a tendency to <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>. His works are numerous (154); some of them have not yet been published. Besides those that have reference to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and the reformation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, others treat of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a>, asceticism, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, philosophy and the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>. He was a believer in <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a>, and in his "Concordance of Astronomy with History" he attempts to show that the dates of the main events of history can be determined by <a href="../cathen/02025a.htm">astronomical</a> calculations. In his "Imago mundi" he taught the possibility of reaching the Indies by the West, and in confirmation of his own reasoning he alleged the authority of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a>, Pliny, and Seneca. D'Ailly's views were useful to <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> and encouraged him in his undertaking. [Cf. La d couverte de l'Am&eacute;rique et Pierre d'Ailly, by Salembier, in "Revuede Lille", 1892, V, 622-641.] <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a> had a copy of the "Imago mundi", on the margin of which he had written many notes with his own hand, and which is still to be seen in the Columbine Library at Seville. In another of <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus's</a> books, the "Libro de las profecias", are to be found many notes taken from d'Ailly's works on cosmography. Hence <a href="../cathen/03397a.htm">Las Casas</a> (Historia de las Indias, vol. I, xi, 89) says that of all "modern" writers d'Ailly exercised the greatest influence on the realization of <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus's</a> plans. His dissertation on the reformation of the calendar, composed in 1411, and read at the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> in March, 1417, was later accepted and completed by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>.
