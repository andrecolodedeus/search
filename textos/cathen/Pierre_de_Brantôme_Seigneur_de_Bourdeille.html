<h1>Pierre de Brant&ocirc;me, Seigneur de Bourdeille</h1>  

<p>One of the most famous of French writers of memoirs, b. in 1539, or a little later; d. 15 July, 1614. He was the son of a nobleman of Perigord and spent his childhood at the court of the Queen of Navarre. He studied at the College of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>. When his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was completed he returned to court at a date not later than 1556, for he saw <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a> "at the age of thirteen or fourteen, in the presence-chamber of the Louvre, publicly recite a Latin oration which she had composed, before King Henry, the queen and all the court". In 1557 Bourdeille was granted the Abbey of Brant&ocirc;me, the name of which he took.

<p>Brant&ocirc;me's life explains his writings, for it is the life of a traveler, a soldier, and a courtier. He himself in a few lines thus sums up its characteristics: "From the time when I began to outgrow subjection to father, and mother, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, besides the journeys I made to the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and the courts in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, I have made seven, when there was peace, outside of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to find adventure by <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, or by seeing the world, I was in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> &mdash; then in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> again, at <a href="../cathen/09574a.htm">Malta</a> for the siege, at La Goulette in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a>, and other foreign places, which I have liked a hundred times better for sojourn than my own country, having the disposition of wandering musicians who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the houses of others better than their own." In 1558 he went for the first time to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> only to leave it again in the suite of <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a> who went to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> to take possession of her kingdom. Brant&ocirc;me has left a touching account of this journey of the unfortunate queen. In 1562 he took part in the first civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and was present at the battle of Dreux, his first engagement. Then he began again to travel, going to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and to Malta; at this last place he spent three months and a half, the active and adventurous life of the Knights pleasing him so greatly that he thought for a moment of entering the order. On his return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> he took part in the second and third civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, was present at the battles of Meaux and St.-Denis, at the engagement at Jarnae, and the siege of <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">La Rochelle</a>. His military career came to an end in 1574 after the campaign in P&eacute;rigord. The office of gentleman of the bed-chamber kept him near King Henry III, and his journeys now were merely to follow the court, where all that interested him seems to have been the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> intrigues, the <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duels</a>, the rivalries, and the assassinations.

<p>Notwithstanding the services he had rendered, his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a>, and the amusement which his Gascon animation afforded the king, Brant&ocirc;me never obtained an important post, but remained among "the minor attendants". This made him indignant and he contemplated going into the Spanish service when an accident &mdash; a fall from his horse&mdash;put an end to his active life. An invalid for four years, he retired to his chateau Richemond and resolved, in order to pass the time, to take up his pen and recount his past life. This was the occasion and the beginning of his career as a writer. But for this fortunate accident posterity would not have had the precious "M&eacute;moirs" of Brant&ocirc;me and would have lost in them an unequaled source of instruction concerning the men and affairs of the sixteenth century. The works of Brant&ocirc;me include: "Vies des capitaines &eacute;trangers et francais"; "Vies des dames illustres"; "Vies des dames galantes". His manner of writing is between the style of a biography and that of a personal memoir. At times he himself appears in his recital and most often he relates what he has personally seen. He has the most important qualification for a writer of memoirs: curiosity. Wherever he went, and he traveled in countries of all kinds, he observed, he listened, he asked questions, he informed himself. But he has no power of criticism; he is a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> witness. He has moreover, no sense of morality, in the modern meaning of the word. He admires but one thing in men and that is <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a>; that this <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> may be of a criminal character is of little consequence to him. He is not the man to bear malice towards others under pretext that they have "some little trifle of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>" on their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. In like manner he has few scruples either as to a choice of means or as to the sources of profit and ways of making gain. He writes in one place: "Nothing is so delightful, so sweet and attractive as spoils of any kind, whether gained by land or by sea." And he is strongly suspected of having plundered his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a>. In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, when he talks of "honesty" and "virtue" he means what the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> of that age called <em>virtu</em>, that is, personal <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, force, and elegance. Above all other spots Brant&ocirc;me enjoyed the chamber and antechamber of the queen. He was never perfectly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> except when surrounded by the ladies who formed the real ornament of the court. This court of <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">Catherine de Medici</a> and its "flying squadron" of three hundred ladies made his <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a> on earth. "Never since the world was made has its equal been seen." He made himself the historiographer of these dames of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, both of the famous and of the <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a>. Among his numerous portraits mention should be made of those of his favorites, Marguerite of Navarre and <a href="../cathen/09764a.htm">Mary Stuart</a>. Light and frivolous, Brant&ocirc;me passes over without mention some of the occurrences of his time of the greatest importance and most fraught with consequences. But we owe to him all sorts of small details, fingerposts to uses of the times. This brilliant and corrupt <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, stamped with the characteristics of the sixteenth century, lives again in his "M&eacute;moirs".

<p>Brant&ocirc;me is an uneven, incorrect, and rambling writer, but his works contain clever witticisms, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and unexpected turns. He took more pains with his style than one would be apt to think, and sought renown as a man of letters. He directed his heirs to have the writings printed which he had made and composed "by his understanding and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, all very carefully corrected with much pains and time . . . I wish that the said impression be in beautiful and large type and in a stately volume in order to appear better. Otherwise I should lose my trouble and the glory that is due me." His desires, however, were not granted at once. His works did not appear for the first time until 1655, and then in a very imperfect and incorrect edition. It was not until the eighteenth century that his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, one of not very high order, was established. His writings are regarded, above all, as a collection of dubious anecdotes. From him the chroniclers of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> stories, the Tallemants des R&eacute;aux and the Bussy-Rabutins, are descended.
