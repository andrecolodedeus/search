<h1>Pierre de B&eacute;rulle</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, and founder of the French congregation of the Oratory, born in the province of Champagne, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, at the ch&acirc;teau of C&eacute;rilly, 4 February, 1575; died October, 1629. De B&eacute;rulle came from a distinguished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of magistrates. From his youth and even before his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> he devoted himself to the conversion of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> and wrote a "Discourse on Interior Abnegation". After entering the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> he was made <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> to Henry IV and, in company with his friend the Cardinal du Perron and <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>, he continued his labours for the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>. With the co-operation of <a href="../cathen/09667b.htm">Madame Acarie</a> (the B. Marie of the Incarnation) he introduced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the Reform of St. Teresa into <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, a work attended with many difficulties. In 1611 de B&eacute;rulle founded the congregation of the Oratory on the model of the one formed some years before by <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Owing to the differences of time and place the French congregation varied in some important respects from the Italian Oratory. (Cf. <a href="../cathen/11274a.htm">FRENCH CONGREGATION OF THE ORATORY</a>.) In speaking of the French <a href="../cathen/11272a.htm">Oratorians</a> it should be remembered that from this congregation proceeded the seventeenth-century reform of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The celebrated <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Cotton called the French Oratory "necessary to the Church", and St. Francis de Sales said also that there was "nothing more saintly and more useful to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". While filling the office of Superior-General of the Oratory Father de B&eacute;rulle was also actively employed in the public affairs of the time; for example, in the arrangements for the marriage of Charles I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> with Henrietta of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, sister of Louis XIII. <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a> in 1627 rewarded de B&eacute;rulle's services to <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> by creating him a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. Two years later de B&eacute;rulle died while saying <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. His disciple, <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, said of him: "He is one of the most saintly priests I have known", and his friend St. Francis de Sales declared: "He is everything which I should desire to be myself". Cardinal de B&eacute;rulle left several works, the remarkable qualities of which led <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a> to call him the <em>Apostolus Verbi incarnati</em>. "This expression", wrote Cardinal Perraud, also an Oratorian, in his work "L'Oratoire de France aux XVIIIe et XVIIIIe si&egrave;cles", "is more than a magnificent panegyric awarded to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the founder of the Oratory; in a word, it contains the essential epitome of his written works, for if may be said of them, as of the entire life of the saintly <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, that the one aim was to make our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> better known and more <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a>." The chief works of Cardinal de B&eacute;rulle are: (1) "Trait&eacute; des &eacute;nergum&egrave;nes" (Troyes, 1599). (2) "Discours etc." (Paris, 1609) on various subjects. (3) "Discours de l'&eacute;tat et des grandeurs de J&eacute;sus" (Paris, 1623). The last mentioned work was reprinted several times; the substance and often the actual expressions are to be found in the diffuse "M&eacute;ditations" of <a href="../cathen/02722a.htm">Father Bourgoing</a> and also in <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet's</a> "El&eacute;vations sur les myst&egrave;res". (4) "Vie de J&eacute;sus" (Paris, 1629); this was a sequel to the preceding work, which the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> author had just finished at the time of his death. (5) "El&eacute;vation &agrave; J&eacute;sus-Christ sur Sainte Madeleine" (Paris, 1627). <a href="../cathen/02722a.htm">Father Bourgoing</a> issued a complete edition of the works of Cardinal de B&eacute;rulle (Paris, 1644), which included some writings not mentioned above, and he added to the edition a "table of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> of this great author arranged according to the order of the <a href="../summa/index.html">"Summa"</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>". In 1856 the Abb&eacute; <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> reprinted the third edition of the complete works. Cardinal de B&eacute;rulle's writings exhibit a robust and vigorous <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> full of unction and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, which is set forth at times in a somewhat diffuse style. One of his biographers, Father Cloysenet, has said: "He wrote the books at his leisure and weighed each word", and the biographer adds very justly that the reader is rewarded for his trouble, for "it is impossible to read them without feeling oneself filled with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>".
