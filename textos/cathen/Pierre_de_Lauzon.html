<h1>Pierre de Lauzon</h1>  

<p>A noted missionary of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a> in the eighteenth century, born at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, 26 September, 1687; died at Quebec, 5 September, 1742. Though sometimes mentioned as Jean, in his official acts he invariably signed Pierre. He joined the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, 24 November, 1703, and after <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> was sent to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> in 1716. From 1716 to 1718 he was Father Daniel Richer's assistant at <a href="../cathen/09360a.htm">Lorette</a>, where he studied the Huron-Iroquois language. He did missionary <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> at Sault St. Louis (Caughnawaga) from 1718 to 1731, with the exception of the scholastic year 1721-22, when he replaced Father Fran&ccedil;ois Le Brun as instructor in the royal <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of hydrography in the college at Quebec, as the exhausting labours of the mission had undermined his health. His <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois Indians</a> clamoured for his return, and on 12 May, 1722, they formally petitioned <a href="../cathen/15311a.htm">Governor Vaudreuil</a> and the Intendant B&eacute;gon to that effect. These in turn, persuaded that it was he alone who, on the occasion of a change in the village site, had prevented two-thirds of the Indians from moving away and settling within easy reach of the English, urged the superior to send him back, and in 1722 he returned to Sault St. Louis. It was none too soon, for the spirit of revolt was spreading among the Caughnawaga <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, in consequence of a menace of again quartering upon them a French garrison, an ever prolific cause of debauchery and disorder. He made his solemn profession of the four <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> at Sault St. Louis on 2 February, 1721.

<p>In 1723 he was named superior of the Caughnawaga mission, and the ability he displayed in governing during the nine succeeding years determined the general, Francis Retz, to place him in 1732 over the whole <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> mission. This, according to established custom in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> entailed the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the college at Quebec. During his term of office, which lasted seven years, he crossed over to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1733) in quest of recruits. Among those whom he brought back with him was the saintly Father Jean-Pierre Aulneau, massacred in 1736 at the Lake of the Woods. <a href="../cathen/05137a.htm">Mgr Dosquet</a> of Quebec, returned at the same time, bringing with him three <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>. The party embarked 29 May and reached Quebec 16 August, after a distressing voyage of eighty days. Terrific winds and pestilential disease marked the long journey. De Lauzon, besides ministering to the sick, as did the other <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> on board, was appointed boatswain's mate, for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> did not shirk their share of the work. In September, 1739, he resumed his missionary labours with the Caughnawaga <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a>, but owing to failing strength he was recalled to Quebec in 1741, where, after a short illness of two and a half days, he died in the following year.
