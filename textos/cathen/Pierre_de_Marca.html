<h1>Pierre de Marca</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and scholar, b. at Gan in B&eacute;arn, 24 Jan., 1594, of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> distinguished in the magistracy; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 29 June, 1662. After studying letters at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/02067c.htm">Auch</a> and law in the University of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, he became councillor (1615), and then president (1621), of the Parliament of Pau, and finally intendant of B&eacute;arn (1631), where his influence greatly helped to restore the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion almost extinguished by the queen, Jeanne d'Albret. His wife, who had borne him four children, died in 1631, and from that moment he used all his spare time in studying and in writing works on religious controversy, history &#151; notably the "Histoire de B&eacute;arn" &#151; and canon law. For the sake of utilizing his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> l&eacute;arning, Louis XIII summoned him to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> to be a member of the Council of State (1639). At <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Cardinal Richelieu's</a> request he published the treatise "Concordia sacerdotii et imperii" (1641), in which he sets forth his Gallican views. After ten years of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and labourious life as a widower, he decided to enter the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. On 28 Dec., 1641, the king made him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Couserans (Gascogny), but he was not <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a> until ten years later, after having seen his "Concordia" placed on the <a href="../cathen/07721a.htm">Index</a> and having signed a retractation of the views there expressed. Sent as intendant to <a href="../cathen/03428a.htm">Catalonia</a>, which had submitted to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (1644), he wrote its history, under the title of "Marca Hispanica"; this work was published after his death by his secretary, the l&eacute;arned <a href="../cathen/02242a.htm">Baluze</a>. Shortly after his return from <a href="../cathen/03428a.htm">Catalonia</a>, Marca was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (28 May, 1652), and when <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> condemned <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> in 1653, he used his influence to have the condemnation accepted. After that he inspired the chief measures taken against this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in the general assemblies of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (1655-60) and received from <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Pope Alexander VII</a> (1656) a highly commendatory letter. Less commendable, however, was his attitude when <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> caused the arrest of Cardinal de Retz, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, for his share in the uprising of the Fronde. In opposition to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who were offended by this violation of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a>, Marca became the king's counsellor, and wrote several pamphlets some of them anonymous, defending the Crown. After the submission and resignation of Cardinal de Retz, Marca was given the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> but died about three weeks after being <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconized</a>. He left a great reputation as historian, jurist, and canonist, but his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> l&eacute;arning was deficient, and his subservience to the royal power excessive. He displayed a certain inconstancy in his opinions, and too much <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> and attachment to his own interests.

<p>Among his numerous publications the most important are: "Histoire de B&eacute;arn", folio (Paris, 1640); "De concordia sacerdotii et imperii seu de libertatibus ecclesiae gallicanae", folio (Paris, 1641) (and other editions); "Marca hispanica seu limes hispanicus", published by <a href="../cathen/02242a.htm">Baluze</a>, folio (Paris, 1688). Some "Lettres inedites de Marca" have been published by Tartizey de Lorroque (Paris, 1881) and J. Bonnet in the "Revuede Gascogne", January-June, 1910.
