<h1>Pierre du Bois, Baron d'Avaugour</h1>  

<p>The Baron d'Avaugour (d. 1664) was sixth Governor General of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. Born of an ancient <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in Brittany, he served in the French army forty years; travelled in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and Sweden, and took part in all the campaigns in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. This familiarity with camp life made his naturally eccentric character rough and unsociable as well. In 1661 he was chosen to succeed d'Argenson as Governor of <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">New France</a> and arrived in Quebec on 31 August of that year. Utterly averse to pomp and <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, he refused the honours which the people of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> wished to show him, and set out at once for <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, in order to familiarize himself with the state of the country. The result was embodied in a report which he sent to <a href="../cathen/04096a.htm">Colbert</a> and the great Cond&eacute;, wherein he advised the fortification of Quebec and the approaches to it by outworks at Ile d'Orl&eacute;ans and at L&eacute;vis. He also recommended that the colony should be freed of its useless officials, to be replaced by soldiers who could hold the <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> in check, and prevent the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> from supplying them with arms. He formed a council, at the head of which he placed the Superior of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. The sale of drink to the Indians was forbidden under pain of death, a penalty which the governor indicted on several who had disobeyed his orders. He became embroiled in a quarrel with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, because they had begged the release of a poor <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> whom he had caused to be <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for selling brandy. He dissolved his council, in order to surround himself with more subservient advisers, and removed the prohibition imposed on the sale of liquor. Serious disorders ensued, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> preached against misuse of authority, and an earthquake which shook the whole valley of the <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> was looked upon by the people as Divine chastisement. Bishop Laval found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to ask for the governor's recall. D'Avaugour was relieved of his command, and a royal commissioner was charged to make enquiries as to his conduct. The governor left Quebec, 23 July, 1663. On his arrival in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> he submitted two statements to the king in regard to the measures to be taken for the colonization and defence of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>; he advised the concentration of the troops at Quebec and the building of a fort at the head of the Richelieu river, also that the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> should be driven out of Fort Orange (Albany), and that the French should take possession of the Hudson River, in order to gain exit to the sea. At a later date one of his suggestions was acted on, when veteran soldiers were sent to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> with permission to settle as colonists. D'Avaugour asked to be allowed to resume active service, and was sent to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, where <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> was aiding the rising of the Croats. He died a soldier's death white <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravely</a> defending the fortress of Zrin against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>.
