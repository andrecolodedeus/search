<h1>Pietro Bembo</h1>  

<p>A famous Italian scholar and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, b. of a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 20 May, 1470; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 18 January, 1547. He was the son of Bernardo Bembo, whose enthusiasm for Italian literature led him to raise a monument to <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. His early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was received at Florence. He afterwards studied Greek under Lascaris at <a href="../cathen/10216a.htm">Messina</a> and philosophy under Pomponazzo at Padua. After spending some time at the court of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, where he met Lucrezia Borgia, with whom he maintained a <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> friendship for many years, he went in 1506 to <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, where he became the leading figure among the brilliant group of men of wit and culture gathered about the court. In 1512 he accompanied his intimate friend, Giuliano de' Medici, to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where a short time afterwards he was appointed secretary to <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Pope Leo X</a>. He remained at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for eight years, enjoying the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of many distinguished men and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> and admired by all who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him. There he became enamoured of the beautiful Morosina. It was at her urgent solicitation that Bembo, in 1520, on the death of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, withdrew from public affairs and retired with his health impaired by severe sickness to <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, where he lived in ease and elegance, devoting himself to literary pursuits and the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of his learned friends. Here he collected an extensive <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and formed a rich museum of medals and antiquities. His Paduan retreat became the gathering-place of all the most cultured and most scholarly men in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In 1529 he accepted the office of historiographer of the republic of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and shortly afterwards was appointed librarian of St. Mark's. In 1539 <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a> recalled him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and conferred on him the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat. From the time of Bembo's <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> preferment there was a marked change in his conduct. Heretofore his life had been anything but edifying &mdash; in fact it had been more <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> than <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. But now he renounced the study of the classics and applied himself chiefly to the study of the Fathers and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. Two years after he was raised to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, he was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a>, and still later he received the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/02489c.htm">Bergamo</a>. He died more admired and lamented than any man of letters of his time and was buried not far from Pope Leo in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Minerva.

<p>Bembo was a thorough master of elegant diction. He possessed beyond any contemporary the formal perfection of style, both in Latin and Italian, demanded by the age in which he lived. In his Latin writings it was his aim to imitate as closely as possible the style of Cicero. His letters were masterpieces of Latin style and of the art of letter-writing. He is said to have passed his compositions through numerous portfolios, revising them in each one of them. Bembo's works include a history of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, poems, dialogues, criticisms and letters. The most important are: "Rerum Veneticarum Libri XII" (1551), a history of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> covering the period from 1487 to 1513, originally published in Latin, but afterwards translated by the author into Italian; "Gli Asolani" (Venice, 1505), a dialogue in Italian on <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, composed in imitation of Cicero's Tusculan Disputations, and dedicated to Lucrezia Borgia; "Le Prose", a short treatise on the Italian language; "Le Rime" (Venice, 1530); "Carmina" (Venice, 1533), a collection of Latin poems; and several volumes of letters, written in Latin. Besides these original works he edited the Italian poems of <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a>, printed by Aldus (1501), and the "Terze rime" of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> (1502). His collected works were published at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in four volumes in 1729.
