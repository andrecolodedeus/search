<h1>Pietro Berrettini</h1>  

<p>(Called Pietro da Cortona)

<p>A distinguished <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>, architect, and writer, b. at <a href="../cathen/04401a.htm">Cortona</a>, in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, 1 November, 1596; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 16 May, 1669. He studied first under his uncle, Filippo Berrettini, and then at Florence under Andrea Commodi. At the age of fifteen he left that city for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and entered the studio of Baccio Ciarpi, a Florentine <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter</a>. There he applied himself to the study of the works of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03155a.htm">Polidoro</a>, to that of the antique <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> and notably of the <a href="../cathen/02341a.htm">bas-reliefs</a> of the column of Trajan. While still very young he attracted the attention of Cardinal Sacchetti, who became his protector, and for whom were <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the first two of his works, "The Battles of Alexander" and "The Rape of the Sabines". Thereupon, <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Pope Urban VIII</a> gave him the order to decorate a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the church of Santa Bibiana. Such was his success there that he received the commission to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> what proved to be his most celebrated work, the ceiling of the great <em>salon</em> of the Barberini Palace, representing, in allegory, the history of that <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. He then designed some <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05100b.htm">dome</a> of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. After a trip through <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> and a sojourn at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, he went to <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, where the Grand Duke Ferdinand II employed him to decorate the Pitti Palace. There he <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> several important frescoes, but left without completing the series, angered by the actions of jealous rivals. The compositions included "Clemency of Alexander to the Family of Darius", "The History of Masinissa", "The Continence of Cyrus", and "The Firmness of Porsenna". The work was completed by his pupil Ciro Ferri. On his return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Berrettini received many important commissions, acquiring a great reputation. He executed a number of frescoes in churches, as well as easel pictures. He became wealthy, and <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Pope Alexander VII</a> created him a Chevalier of the Order of the Golden Spur. His principal pupils were Francesco Romanelli, Ferri, Testa, <a href="../cathen/06564b.htm">Giordano</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02685b.htm">Borgognone</a>. He is buried in the church of San Martino, of which he was architect, and to which he left a large sum of money.
