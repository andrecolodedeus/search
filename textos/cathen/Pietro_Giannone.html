<h1>Pietro Giannone</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> historian, born 7 May, 1676, at Ischitella in the province of Capinata, <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>; died at <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, 27 March, 1748. He received his first instruction in the house of his uncle, Gaetano Argento, a lawyer, and after having received the degree of Doctor of Law at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> he began to practise his profession, following the example of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. He devoted all his leisure time to the study of history. After preparatory work extending over a period of twenty years, he published under the title "Dell' istoria civile del regno di Napoli" (1723, 4 vols.), a work which caused a great sensation, especially on account of its bitter anti-ecclesiastical bias, which led to its repeated translation into English and German. In it Giannone combined a narrative of political matters, founded on historical sources, with an interesting description of the juridical and moral condition of the country; but as he ascribes all existing evils to the malignant influence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, especially the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, we may justly assume it a compilation of biased attacks and misstatements. It was immediately put on the Index and its author <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and forced to leave <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. He went to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> where he was pensioned by Emperor Charles VI. He was readmitted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> soon after by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> who was in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> at the time. Having forfeited his pension in 1744 Giannone went to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, but the Government, suspecting him on account of his political opinions, surrounded him with spies. He tried to gain the Government's goodwill by publishing a pamphlet entitled: "Lettera intorno al dominio del mare Adriatico", eulogizing <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice's</a> conquest of the Adriatic; he was unsuccessful and was forcibly expelled in the following year. After wandering to and fro for a while he accepted the hospitality of an old book-dealer in Geneva. There he composed his intensely anti-clerical essay: "Il triregno ossia del regno del cielo, della terra e del papa" (Geneva, 1735, new ed. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1895, 3 vols.). Enticed to a village in <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, he was arrested, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the fortress of Ceva, and transported thence to <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, where he died. It is reported that before his death he was reconciled with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Giannone's posthumous works are: "Opere postume" (Lausanne, 1760; enlarged, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1768; new ed., 2 vols., Capolago, 1841). The first volume contains: "Apologia dell' istoria civile del regno di Napoli; the second: "Indice generale dell'opera dei tre regni". His collected works appeared in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (5 vols., 1858). Later, Mancini published his posthumous works in two volumes (Turin, 1859), entitled "Opere inedite", containing the "Discorsi storici e politici sopra gli annali di Tito Livio"; "La chiesa sotto il pontificato di Gregorio il Grande". The autobiography of Giannone was published by Pierantoni (Rome, 1890).
