<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti</h1>  

<p>Sienese <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>. The time of their birth and death is not known. Their dated works extend over a period of thirty years, from 1316 to 1348. Pietro was the elder. He was the pupil of <a href="../cathen/09730d.htm">Simone di Martino</a>, some of whose formul&aelig; he has preserved faithfully; but he was profoundly influenced by <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a>. He introduced the dramatic into the <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienese</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Unfortunately he could not control his wonderful feeling for the lifelike and in the end he sometimes failed to distinguish history from the passing events of everyday life. His first known work is the "History of St. Humilitas", a religious of Vallombrosa (d. 1310). The picture <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1316 at the Academy of Florence bears the impress of the liveliest sense of reality. It abounds in small, but often delightful genre scenes. In his Assisi frescoes, where he continued <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto's</a> "Life of Jesus", this realism strangely loses tone. In the "Cenacle", for example, Pietro devotes an entire piece to a kitchen interior where lads wash the dishes while a dog licks the plates. This lack of dignity is perhaps mere familiarity coupled with good humour. Fondness for this sort of picture is in part the cause of our liking for the creations of the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; it cannot even be said that details of this kind may not be impressive as is seen in <a href="../cathen/03169b.htm">Veronese's</a> "Marriage at Cana". But Pietro, like most of the artists of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, is too lacking in style and in art. Or rather he has only an intermittent sense of them. Some of his pieces at least show of what he was capable; such as the admirable <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, which represents the Blessed Virgin in half-life size between St. John and St. Louis, and in which the fresco work attains the beauty of enamelling and of the goldsmith's art, while the countenance of the Virgin, tearfully regarding the Divine Child, expresses most beautifully maternal anguish, reminding us of the <em>darkouoen gelasasa</em> of Homer. In presence of such a canvas it is impossible not to deplore the frivolity of a master who sacrificed his lofty plastic faculties and gift of moral expression to the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> of so many trivial realities and insignificant emotions.

<p>Though still more gifted than his brother, Ambrogio also wasted his talents, but owing to a different <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, viz., a craze for the allegoric and didactic. He was however one of the most delicately poetic minds of his generation, and no one at Florence could rival the serious and dreamy beauty of his <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> faces, as in the "St. Dorothy" of the Academy of Siena (1326), in which seems to be revived the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the adorable <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of <a href="../cathen/09730d.htm">Simone di Martino</a>. There is not in the art of the fourteenth century a more impressive canvas than that of the Academy of Florence in which <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">St. Nicholas of Bari</a>, on the shore of a cliff-bordered sea, contemplates the sunset (1332). He excelled in lyric subjects but he attempted <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> in a grand <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> manner. His most important work is that at the Palazzo della Signoria of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, the allegory of "Good and Evil Government" (1338-40). The taste of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> for these <a href="../cathen/10557b.htm">"moralities"</a> and psychomachies is well-known. There is hardly a <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in which we do not find sculptured representations of the contest between vice and virtue, allegories of the virtues, the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the wise and foolish virgins, the figures of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">Synagogue</a>. Already <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a> had <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> the allegories of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> virtues, and <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> was soon to compose his "Triumphs" of Love, Glory, Time, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">Eternity</a>.

<p>For the past sixty years the Republic of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> had been at the summit of its fortunes. It was desirous of immortalizing the memory of its greatness. From this point of view the frescoes of Ambrogio are of great interest; this is perhaps the first example of lay <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and of art used to represent <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and life, without any religious conception. It was a course in <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> philosophy and at the same time a <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a> to the city. The composition is developed on three walls, forming a sort of triptych. The middle fresco displays under a dogmatic form the ideal of democracy. The Virtues which direct the State are seated on a platform; this is the tribunal or the legislative assembly. The most famous of these figures is that of Peace, which, reclining on her throne in magnificent drapery and resting on her arms, is certainly imitated from an antique medal or <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> (such imitations are not rare in the thirteenth century: cf. the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, the work of Giovanni Pisano, and some <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>). But the other figures are little more than abstractions and can be identified only with the adventitious aid of a multitude of inscriptions, devices, and <a href="../cathen/12046a.htm">phylacteries</a>.

<p>On the other two walls are similarly developed the effects of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> social hygiene. After the theory follows the application. The left wall (Evil Government) is unfortunately almost ruined. But the opposite one, which is more intelligible, suffices to convey an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painter's</a> method. The length of the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> is divided into two halves, one of which shows the city and the other the country. And in each of these parts is a host of episodes, a great collection of little pictures of manners, which analyse in a thousand ways the condition of a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. The general <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is resolved into a multitude of anecdotes. We see dances, banquets, children at <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, weddings, some peasants leading their asses to market while others are tilling the ground; in the distance is a port whence vessels are sailing away. All these various scenes are most entertaining and furnish much information about <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienese</a> life and customs in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. But one is lost in the complexity of this chronicle and the confusion of this journal. The result is an extremely curious work, though one almost devoid of artistic value.

<p>To sum up, Ambrogio remains one of the most interesting minds of his time by the very variety of his contradictory talents and the turn of mind at once idealistic and realistic which he displayed, without, unfortunately, succeeding in bringing them into unity. As a whole the work of the Lorenzetti (starting from very different points of view) consists in an attempt to reconcile art with observation and familiar reality. Pietro's aim is to move, Ambrogio's rather to instruct. The former is a dramatist, the latter a moralist. Both tend equally to genre <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. Unfortunately fresco, especially in their day, was the mode of expression least suited to this. They required the miniature, or German engraving, or the small familiar picture of the <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> or the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>. Their talent remained isolated and their premature attempt was doomed to failure. In spite of everything they remain the most lifelike <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> of their generation; and some fifteenth-century <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a>, such as Sassetta or Sano di Pietro, owe them much in this respect. Besides, Ambrogio, was the first who attempted in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> philosophic <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> and the picturesque expression of general <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. His "Sermons" in pictures have not been lost. He created a tradition to which we owe two of the most important works of the fourteenth century, the anonymous frescoes of the "Anchorites" and of the "Triumph of Death." at the Campo Santo of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and those of the "Militant and the Teaching Church" in the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>. In fact it is from these that the finest conceptions of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> are derived, and the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of having indirectly inspired <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> with the "Camera della Segnatura" cannot be disputed with Ambrogio Loienzetti. It is a glory which the greatest artists may well <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> him.
