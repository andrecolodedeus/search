<h1>Pietro della Valle</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> traveller in the Orient, b. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 2 April, 1586; d. there, 21 April, 1652. He belonged to a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and received an excellent <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. As a young man he was a poet, orator, a soldier in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> service, and a member of the Roman Academy of the Umoristi. In 1611 he took part in a campaign against the Barbary States. An unfortunate love-affair was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a>, lasting eleven years. On 8 June, 1614, he started from <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> by sea and went first to Constantinople where he remained a year and learned both <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> and Arabic. On 25 September, 1615, he traveled to <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, thence to Cairo, and in the spring of 1616 on to Jerusalem. After visiting the Holy Places he continued his journey to <a href="../cathen/04611a.htm">Damascus</a>, <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Aleppo</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02202c.htm">Bagdad</a>. Here he married a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> named Maani who accompanied him on his travels during the succeeding years. It was probably on account of his marriage that he visited <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of his wife had been robbed by Kurds. In 1618 he was hospitably received in Northern <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> by the Shah Abbas the Great whom he followed to the capital Ispahan. He acted as mediator between the shah and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>. During the next four years he explored <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>; then in October, 1621, he started for Perseopolis and Schiras. He was prevented from continuing his journey as far as <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>. His wife died on 30 December, 1621, and he kept her body with him until his return. In 1622 he took part in the siege of Ormus from which the <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portuguese</a> were driven. He then spent two years (1623-24) in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, where his headquarters were Surat and <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a>. In 1625 he started on the return journey by way of Muscat, Basra, <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Aleppo</a>, <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and arrived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 28 March, 1626. <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> appointed him a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chamberlain. The rest of Valle's life was fairly peaceful. His second wife was a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Georgian <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a> Mariuccia, who had accompanied him on his travels. The most important of his works is his account of his travels (Viaggi) in fifty-four friendly letters (Lettere famigliari) addressed to Mario Schipano, a professor of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. They appeared first at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in three volumes (1650-53) and were translated later into English, French, German, and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>. The narrative is distinguished by learning and keen observation but inclines to credulity and stories of marvellous occurrences.
