<h1>Pittsburgh</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF PITTSBURG/PITTSBURGH (PITTSBURGENSIS).

<p>Suffragan of Philadelphia, in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a>. It comprises the counties of Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Greene, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, Lawrence, Washington, and Westmoreland in the <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">State of Pennsylvania</a>, an area of 7238 square miles, the total population of which is 1,944,942 (U.S. Census, 1910). About 24.42 per cent of these are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.

<p>It is probable that the first religious services held by white men within the limits of what is now the Diocese of Pittsburg were conducted by a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Father Bonnecamp, who accompanied Celeron in his exploration along the Allegheny and Ohio Rivers in 1749. The strategic character of the ground where the Monongahela and Allegheny Rivers meet to form the Ohio pointed this place out to George Washington as a spot of future importance. He first saw "the Forks", as the place was called by the Indians, on 24 November, 1753, when engaged in bearing a letter from Robert Dinwiddie, Lieutenant-Governor of Virginia, to the commander of the French forces, asserting the British claims to the territory of Western <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. Both <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> regarded the Forks as a valuable military position, opening a way for exploration to the west and south, and each was determined to occupy it. At the time the adjacent country was occupied by various <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indian tribes</a> &mdash; the Shawnees, Delawares, Senecas &mdash; dwelling along the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio Rivers. The first place of public worship within this territory was a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> erected by the French in the stockade of Fort Duquesne, after Captain Contrecoeur and his forces had driven Ensigns Ward and Frazier from the Fort they were constructing at the fork of the Ohio. This <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was built at some time later than 16 April, 1754, and dedicated under the title of "Assumption of the Blessed Virgin of the Beautiful River". In those days and for long afterwards, the Ohio &mdash; on account of its clear water and rugged scenery &mdash; was known as the "beautiful river".

<p>There is preserved in the archives of the city of <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a> a register of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> and deaths kept by the army <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> at Fort Duquesne, from which we learn that the first interment in the cemetery of the fort was that of Toussaint Boyer, who died 20 June, 1754. The first white child born on the site of the city of Pittsburg was John Daniel Norment. His godfather was the chief officer of Fort Duquesne, John Daniel Sieur Dumas. These entries are signed by "Friar Denys Baron, Recollect Priest, Chaplain". If written evidence alone were to be considered, Father Baron, and not Father Bonnecamp (mentioned above), must be regarded as the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to offer the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a>, and the first white man to perform any public act of religious worship in the territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. The register of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> and interments which took place at Fort Duquesne begins 11 July, 1753, and ends 10 October, 1756. The records before June, 1754, are from posts occupied by the French in the north-western part of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, now in the <a href="../cathen/05518b.htm">Diocese of Erie</a>, before they took possession of the spot on which Fort Duquesne stood. In the register we find entries made by Friar Gabriel Amheuser and Friar Luke Collet, but they were <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> from other French forts. Friar Denys Baron alone signs himself "Chaplain" of Fort Duquesne. These records testify to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and burial of a number of Indians, showing that the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a> did not neglect their missionary <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>.

<p>The French evacuated the fort, the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> army under General Forbes took possession in 1758, and the place was named Pittsburg, or Fort Pitt, after William Pitt, Prime Minister of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. For thirty or forty years the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion was almost, if not entirely, without adherents in Western <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. Gradually, as the western part of the state was settled, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> gained a foothold, but met with much opposition in this strongly <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> section. In 1784 their number had increased sufficiently about Pittsburg to warrant them in sending Felix Hughes to the Very Rev. John Carroll, at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, who was then superior of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> asking that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> be sent to minister to them at least once or twice a year. By this time there were seventy-five or eighty <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> along the Chartiers Creek, up the Monongahela Valley, and about Pittsburg. Priests were few in the country then, and the request could not be complied with. Under such conditions some of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in Western <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> had become indifferent, abandoned their religion altogether, or neglected their religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, even when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> came. It is probable that the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to pass through Western <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> and minister to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> there was a <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, Father Paul, who came in 1785. Another was the Rev. Charles Whalen, a <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a>, who remained a short time in 1787. In 1792 the Rev. Benedict Joseph Flaget, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bardstown, remained here for some weeks. In 1793 the Revs. Baden and Barrieres came to Pittsburg and remained from September until November. The Rev. Michael Fournier was here fourteen weeks in the winter of 1796-7.

<p>The site on which St. Vincent's Archabbey now stands, in Unity township, Westmoreland county, was the first place where a permanent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlement was made in Western <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. This was about 1787. The Rev. Theodore Bowers purchased the tract of land then known as "Sportsman's Hall" in 1790, and became the first <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the little colony. When the Rev. Peter Heilbron came to take charge of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, in November, 1799, he found seventy-five communicants. In March, 1789, ground was purchased at Greensburg, where the Rev. John B. Causse said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> for the first time in June, 1789. A log <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was begun in 1790, but was never completed. The Rev. Patrick Lonergan went with a colony of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from Sportsman's Hall in 1798 and, after a short stay at West Alexander, began a church at Waynesburg, Greene County, in 1799, or 1800, "which", says <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, writing in 1862, "was completed by me thirty years later". In the summer of 1799, the <a href="../cathen/06367b.htm">Rev. Demetrius A. Gallitzin</a> came to reside with a colony of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> at Maguire's Settlement, now known as Loretto, in Cambria County, in the present <a href="../cathen/01368a.htm">Diocese of Altoona</a>, and his mission-field included much of what is now the Diocese of Pittsburg. These, with the churches at Sugar Creek, Armstrong County, where the Rev. Lawrence F. Phelan took up his residence in 1805, and at Pittsburg, where the Rev. William F. X. O'Brien settled in 1808, were the first centres of the Faith in Western <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who had reared the first altar at Fort Duquesne, furnished the first missionaries to attempt permanent centres of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> life, and establish places of worship in Western <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. The Revs. Theodore Browers, John B. Causse, Patrick Lonergan, Peter Heilbron, Charles B. Maguire, all belonged to one or another branch of the Order of St. Francis.



<p>The Rev. William F. X. O'Brien, the first resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Pittsburg, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> 11 June, 1808, came to Pittsburg in November of the same year, and took up the erection of the church which is known in history as "Old St. Patrick's". It stood at the corner of Liberty and Epiphany streets, at the head of Eleventh Street, in front of the present Union Station. The Right Rev. Michael Egan dedicated this church in August, 1811, and its dedication and the administration of the Sacrament of Confirmation mark the first visit of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to this part of the state. After twelve years of labour and exposure on the missions of his extensive territory, in which there were perhaps not more than 1800 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, Father O'Brien's health declined, and in March, 1820, he retired to <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, where he died 1 November, 1832. He was succeeded in May, 1820, by the Rev. Charles B. Maguire, who had been <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the church at Sportsman's Hall since 1817. "Priest Maguire", as he was called by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> people of Pittsburg, was a man of great ability and extensive learning, and in his day one of the best known and most respected and influential citizens of the community. He gave to the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Patrick, and to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Western <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> something of his own strong <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> and splendid qualities of order, progress, industry, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and fidelity to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> &mdash; influences that are still felt. He began in 1827 the erection of St. Paul's church, which, when finished and dedicated 4 May, 1834, was the largest and most imposing church edifice in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clare</a> Nuns opened a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and academy in 1828 on Nunnery Hill in what was then Allegheny (now the North Side of Pittsburg). The community left Nunnery Hill in 1835 and, after remaining in another part of Allegheny until 1837, the sisters either returned to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, or entered other <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.

<p>Father Maguire died of cholera 17 July, 1833, and was succeeded as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> by his assistant, the Rev. John O'Reilly, who completed St. Paul's church, introduced the Sisters of Charity from Emmitsburg, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, in 1835, and established in the same year a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and in 1838 an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a> which the Sisters of Charity conducted until they were withdrawn from the diocese by their superiors in 1845. In April, 1837, Father O'Reilly was transferred to Philadelphia, and the Rev. Thomas Heyden, of Bedford, took his place. In November of the same year, Father Heyden returned to Bedford, and the <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Rev. P.R. Kenrick</a>, the late <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of St. Louis, became <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Paul's, Pittsburg. In the summer of 1838, Father O'Reilly exchanged places with <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Father Kenrick</a>, and returned to Pittsburg. He remained at St. Paul's until succeeded by the Rev. Michael O'Connor, 17 June, 1841. He then went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, entered the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Congregation of the Mission</a>, and died at St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, 4 March, 1862. The first <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community of men was established in Pittsburg, 8 April, 1839, which date marks the advent of the Fathers of the Congregation of Our Most Holy Redeemer, in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the Rev. Father Prost, who came to take charge of St. Patrick's parish, and established St. Philomena's.

<p>Bishop Flaget appears to have been the first to regard Pittsburg as the future see of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, having entertained this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> in 1825. As early as 1835 <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Bishop Kenrick</a> proposed to the cardinal prefect of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> a division of the Diocese of Philadelphia by the erection at Pittsburg of an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>, and he recommended the appointment of the Rev. John Hughes as Bishop either of Philadelphia or of Pittsburg. The suggestion of <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Bishop Kenrick</a> was officially approved in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in January, 1836, the Rev. John Hughes was named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Philadelphia, and <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Bishop Kenrick</a> was transferred to Pittsburg. Some obstacle intervened, and the appointments were recalled. The matter was again discussed in the Third <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 16 April, 1837, but no definite action was taken. In the Fifth <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a>, which assembled at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, 14 May, 1843, the division of the <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">State of Pennsylvania</a> into two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> was recommended to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and the Rev. Dr. Michael O'Connor was named as the most suitable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to govern the new see. Both actions of the council were confirmed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The new Diocese of Pittsburg, according to the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of erection, issued 11 August, 1843, was "Western <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>". This designation being rather vague, <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Bishop Kenrick</a>, of Philadelphia, and Bishop O'Connor agreed to consider the Diocese of Pittsburg as comprising the Counties of Bedford, Huntingdon, Clearfield, McKean, and Potter, and all west of them in the state of <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. This agreement was afterwards confirmed by a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The new diocese contained an area of 21,300 sq. miles, or a little less than one-half of the state, and not more than one-third either of the entire, or of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population. Dr. Michael O'Connor was in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the time of the division of the Diocese of Philadelphia, and his appointment to the new see was announced to him by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, while the future <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/06423a.htm">knelt</a> at his feet to ask permission to enter the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. "You shall be bishop first, and a Jesuit afterwards", said the venerable pontiff. These prophetic words were literally fulfilled. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of his appointment was <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 11 August, 1843, and he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> four days later by Cardinal Franzoni in the church of S. Agata, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on the feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin, the titular feast of the first <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at Fort Duquesne.

<p>Michael O'Connor was born near the city of <a href="../cathen/04370b.htm">Cork</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 27 September, 1810. His early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was received at Queenstown, in his native country. At the age of fourteen he went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he studied for several years. Then he was sent by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04072a.htm">Cloyne</a> and Ross to the College of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where he won the title of Doctor of Divinity. <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a>, then Rector of the English College at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in his "Recollections of the Last Four Popes", speaks in terms of high commendation of the ability of the youthful O'Connor, and of the manner in which he won his doctor's cap and ring. On 1 June, 1833, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>, and immediately afterwards was appointed professor of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. The post of vice-rector of the <a href="../cathen/08157a.htm">Irish College</a> was next assigned to him, and, returning to his native land, he was stationed for a time in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Fermoy. At the invitation of <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Bishop Kenrick</a> he came to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in 1839, and was at once appointed to a professorship in St. Charles Borromeo's Seminary, Philadelphia, afterwards becoming its president. During his connexion with the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, he attended the mission at Morristown, and built the church of <a href="../cathen/06233b.htm">St. Francis Xavier</a> at Fairmount. In June, 1841, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the western part of the <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">State of Pennsylvania</a>, and came to Pittsburg to succeed the Rev. John O'Reilly, as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Paul's. The event is chronicled in his notebook as follows: "June 17, 1841, arrived at Pittsburg on this day (Thursday); lodging at Mrs. Timmons, at $4.00 per week". One month after his arrival, Father O'Connor undertook the erection of a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, organized a literary <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> for young men of the city, and opened a reading-room. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pittsburg 15 August, 1843, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Soon after his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> he left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and passed through <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> on his way to America, with a view of providing <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He called at <a href="../cathen/10087b.htm">Maynooth</a> in October, 1843, and made an appeal to the students, asking some of them to volunteer their services for the new Diocese of Pittsburg. Five students whose course of studies was almost completed and three others also far advanced resolved to accompany the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Coming to <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, he obtained a colony of seven Sisters of the recently-founded Order of Our Lady of Mercy to take charge of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and of the higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of young ladies. These were the first Sisters of the Order of Mercy, founded by Mother Catherine McCauley, to establish a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. He sailed for America 12 November, and arrived at Pittsburg in December, 1843. At that time the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had in his vast diocese 33 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, a few of which were unfinished, 16 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of less than 25,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.

<p>The following were the churches and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Western <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> at the time of the erection of the Diocese of Pittsburg. In Allegheny County: Pittsburg, St. Paul's Cathedral, the Very Rev. M. O'Connor and his assistant, the Rev. Joseph F. Deane; St. Patrick's, the Rev. E. F. Garland; St. Philomena's (German), the Revs. John N. Neuman, Julius P. Saenderl, F. X. Tschenheus, Peter Czackert, C.SS.R. The Rev. A. P.

Blair County: Newry, St. Patrick's; St. Luke's, Sinking Valley and St. Mary's, Hollidaysburg, attended from Newry by the Rev. James Bradley. Cambria County: Loretto, St. Michael's; Jefferson (now Wilmore), St. Bartholomew's; Johnstown, St. John Gaulbert; Ebensburg, St. Patrick's (now Holy Name of Jesus); Hart's Sleeping Place, St. Joseph's; Summit, St. Aloysius's (these places attended in 1843 by the Rev. Peter H. Lemke, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Loretto, and his assistant, the Rev. Matthew W. Gibson). Mercer County: Mercer, St. Raphael's, attended from Butler by the Rev. H. P. Gallagher. Clearfield County: Clearfield, St. Francis; French Settlement, St. Mary's; Grampian Hills, St. Bonaventure.

Elk County: Elk Creek (dedication unknown); Marysville (dedication unknown). Clarion County: Erismans, St. Michael's; Red Bank, St. Nicholas's. The Rev. J. A. Berti seems to have attended the missions of Clearfield, Crawford, <a href="../cathen/05518b.htm">Erie</a>, Elk, and Clarion Counties in 1843.

<p>As yet there were but two <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist Fathers</a> at St. Philomena's church, and the Sisters of Charity, who had charge of St. Paul's Orphan Asylum, and two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in Pittsburg. The first <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> building at St. Paul's, which has already been mentioned, was opened 14 April, 1844. On 16 June of the same year the first <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod was held, and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> were enacted for the government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. On the 30th of the same month a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> was opened for the use of the coloured <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the city. In the same year the publication of "The Catholic" was begun, and the paper has been regularly issued every week down to the present time. St. Michael's <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, was established also in 1844. Thus in the brief space of a single year Bishop O'Connor had succeeded in thoroughly organizing all the departments of his vast diocese. The <a href="../cathen/12399b.htm">Presentation Brothers</a> came in 1845 to take charge of St. Paul's Boys' School. They withdrew from the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, however, in 1848. In 1846 Bishop O'Connor received the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> into the diocese. Their <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was founded at St. Vincent's, Beatty, Pa., by the late <a href="../cathen/15648b.htm">Archabbot Boniface Wimmer</a> (then the Rev. Boniface Wimmer, O.S.B.) from the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Melten, in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and in its college and <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> many young men have received their higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and completed their studies for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. The little seed sown at Sportsman's Hall has developed into the great Archabbey of St. Vincent's, which is, at this <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> (1911), the largest <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> institution in the world. In 1847 a community of the members of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis came from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and settled at Loretto, Cambria County, Pa. In 1848 the Sisters of Notre Dame opened a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at St. Philomena's, Pittsburg. The <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a>, then an Italian order, were introduced into the diocese in 1852, and from their first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Paul's, Pittsburg, the order has since spread into many States of the Union.

<p>By 1852 the diocese had increased to such an extent that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> began to consider the propriety of having it divided, and a new one formed from the northern counties. He laid the matter before the Fathers of the First <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a>, which assembled 9 May, 1852, and the division was recommended by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> dividing the Diocese of Pittsburg and erecting the new <a href="../cathen/05518b.htm">Diocese of Erie</a> were <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 29 July, 1853. The dividing line ran east and west along the northern boundaries of Cambria, <a href="../cathen/07738a.htm">Indiana</a>, Armstrong, Butler, and Lawrence, taking from Pittsburg all the counties lying north thereof, and giving thirteen counties to the new and fifteen to the old diocese. The area of the Diocese of Pittsburg was reduced from 21,300 sq. miles to 11,314 sq. miles. Bishop O'Connor chose the new and poorer diocese as his portion, and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> approved his choice. The Rev. Joshua M. Young, of the <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Archdiocese of Cincinnati</a>, was named <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pittsburg. The reluctance of Father Young to be the successor of Bishop O'Connor in the See of Pittsburg and the urgent petition of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the people of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> moved the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to restore Bishop O'Connor after five months (20 December, 1853) to his former <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a>, and appoint Bishop Young to the new <a href="../cathen/05518b.htm">Diocese of Erie</a>. A comparison of the condition of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of its division to form the <a href="../cathen/05518b.htm">Diocese of Erie</a> with what it was at the time of its erection ten years before will furnish the most convincing evidence of the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and energy which characterized the administration of Bishop O'Connor. At the time of the division, the 43 churches had increased to 78, and 4 more were in course of erection. The 16 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had increased to 64, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population from less than 25,000 to at least 50,000.

<p>On 23 May, 1860, Bishop O'Connor resigned his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to carry out his cherished purpose of entering the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. He made his <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and then returned to this country, where he laboured with characteristic energy and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> as a professor, also preaching and lecturing all over the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. With his other acquirements, Bishop O'Connor was a linguist of considerable note, being familiar with Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and speaking English, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. He was called to his reward 18 October, 1872, in his sixty-third year. His remains were deposited by the side of his <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> brethren at Woodstock, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, and there still lies all that is mortal of one of the most brilliant lights that has ever shed its lustre on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. When Bishop O'Connor resigned, the statistics of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> were as follows: 77 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, 86 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 30 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> students, 4 male and 2 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, 1 <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, 3 male and 2 <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> institutions of higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylums</a>, 1 <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 50,000. Any one who understands the resources of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in 1843 would find it difficult to comprehend how the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> could have accomplished so much for the good of religion. A stranger, after examining all that had been done &mdash; the charitable and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational establishments</a> founded, churches built &mdash; would at once conclude that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who accomplished so much must have had control of vast means, or must have been at the head of a numerous and influential, wealthy, and munificent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> body. Yet Bishop O'Connor in fact enjoyed none of these advantages. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the Diocese of Pittsburg at that time, though generous to support religion, cannot be said to have been influential in the community, or possessed of great means. Indeed they were, almost without exception, the poorer people of the community. But during sixteen years they had enjoyed the advantages of an episcopal administration, all things considered, the most brilliant and most successful in the history of the American Church. The Very Revs. James A. Stillinger and Edward McMahon were Bishop O'Connor's vicars-general.

<p>The Right Rev. Michael Domenec, who succeeded Bishop O'Connor, 28 September, 1860, was, at the time of his appointment, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the church of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, Germantown. He was born at Ruez, near <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, in 1816. His early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was received at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. The outbreak of the Carlist War interrupted his studies, and at the age of fifteen he went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to complete his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. Having spent some years in the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he entered that order. In the company of the Very Rev. John Timon, then visitor-general of the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>, he came to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in 1838, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Barrens, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, 29 June, 1839. Having acted as professor in that <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, at the same time labouring as a missionary in various parts of <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, he was sent in 1845 with some other <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers to take charge of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Philadelphia, a position formerly occupied by the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pittsburg. In conjunction with his work at the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> he was <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, first at Nicetown, and afterwards at Germantown. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in St. Paul's Cathedral, Pittsburg, on 9 December, 1860, by <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop F.P. Kenrick</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and entered upon his new <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> with a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and activity, the effects of which were soon evident all over the diocese in new churches, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, and asylums for the sick and poor.

<p>While Bishop Domenec was recognized as a man of great learning, an eloquent preacher, and a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and indefatigable chief <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, it is to be regretted that the closing chapter in the life and history of this amiable and saintly <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was darkened by the gloom of one of the severest trials that any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> has ever passed through. When the panic of 1873 had destroyed the prosperity of the country and disheartened the people of the Diocese of Pittsburg, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, probably overcome by financial and other difficulties which beset him, set out on a visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 5 Nov., 1875, to petition for the division of the Diocese of Pittsburg, and the formation of a new diocese with Allegheny City as its see. Priests and people were taken by surprise when the division was announced from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and found difficulty in crediting the report. But further intelligence confirmed it. The Diocese of Pittsburg was divided, and Bishop Domenec was transferred to the new See of Allegheny. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> for both the division and the transfer were <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 11 January, 1876. Many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> had expected that the division of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> with Altoona as the new see would take place in time, but felt that the panic which the people were passing through must necessarily defer it for a few years to come. By <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 16 January, 1876, the Very Rev. John Tuigg of <a href="../cathen/01368a.htm">Altoona</a> was elevated to the vacant See of Pittsburg. The new diocese of Allegheny had 8 counties, with an area of 6530 sq. miles, leaving the parent diocese 6 counties, and an area of 4784 sq. miles. Broken in health and saddened by the trials which he had passed through, Bishop Domenec resigned the See of Allegheny 27 July, 1877, and retired to his native land, where he died at <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, 7 January, 1878. Bishop Domenec had for his vicars-general the Very Revs. Tobias Mullen, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05518b.htm">Erie</a>, and John Hickey. The Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/07416a.htm">Congregation of the Holy Ghost</a> entered the diocese 15 April, 1874, and, on 1 October, 1878, opened the Pittsburg College of the Holy Ghost, which is now (1911) attended by over 400 students.

<p>The Right Rev. John Tuigg was born in County Cork, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, 19 February, 1821. He began his studies for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> at <a href="../cathen/01314b.htm">All Hallows College</a>, <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and completed his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course at St. Michael's Seminary, Pittsburg. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Bishop O'Connor on 14 May, 1850, and was assigned to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> as an assistant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and secretary to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He organized the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of St. Bridget, Pittsburg, in 1853. He was then entrusted with the charge of the important mission of <a href="../cathen/01368a.htm">Altoona</a>, where monuments of his pastoral <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and energy exist in the shape of a church, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. In 1869 he was appointed vicar-forane for the eastern portion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. On 11 January, 1876, he was appointed to fill the vacant See of Pittsburg, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of St. Paul on 19 March, 1876, by the Most Rev. James Frederic Wood, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Philadelphia. At that time, owing mainly to the effects of the panic of three years previous, and the discontent arising from the division of the former Diocese of Pittsburg, he found great financial and other cares to encounter. The division of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was the beginning of the darkest period in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> in Western <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. It was followed by disputes, mistrust, and litigations, which sundered many friendships, created <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> and lay factions, and did <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to the peace and charity which had hitherto blessed the diocese. In the manner in which it was brought about, in the lines which designated the limits of each <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, in the apportionment of <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>, in fact from every point of view, the division <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> unsatisfactory and resulted in bitter contention and disorder which ended only with the suppression of the See of Allegheny and the reunion of the two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> as though no division had taken place. With foresight, energy, determination, and perseverance the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> faced the difficulties with which he was surrounded, and entered upon the task of restoring order and confidence, and placing the embarrassed properties of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> upon a safe and sound footing. He sacrificed his personal comfort, his own private means, and reduced the expense of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by the strictest economy, in order that the creditors of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> might not suffer loss, and although his once vigorous constitution was shattered by the labours and trials through which he passed, confidence was restored, and the diocese started on one of the most prosperous periods of its history. Although these heavy burdens rested on his shoulders, as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pittsburg, yet the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, on 3 August, 1877, after Bishop Domenec resigned, entrusted to him the administration of the vacant See of Allegheny.

<p>In the year 1833 Bishop Tuigg was warned of his approaching end by a stroke of paralysis, and, although he lingered for some years longer, suffering and pain were his constant companions. By slow but sure degrees he continued to grow worse, until on 7 December, 1889, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the venerable <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> passed away to its heavenly home. His last moments were singularly peaceful, and his death was a fitting close to his long and saintly career. It may be said of him that he combined the qualities of firmness and gentleness to a degree rarely found in the same individual; strong and unyielding when confident of the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and propriety of any position he took, he was at the same time kind and courteous to those from whom he differed. Proofs of his executive ability, his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and his self-sacrificing <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> abound throughout the diocese over which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> called him to rule, and which he left in better condition than it had known for some years.

<p>The Right Rev. Richard Phelan, the fourth occupant of the See of Pittsburg, was born 1 January, 1828, at Sralee, County Kilkenny, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. He was one of a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of nine children, four of whom embraced the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. He entered St. Kieran's College, Kilkenny, in 1844, to study for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. When Bishop O'Connor visited <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, in 1850, in search of students to labour in the Diocese of Pittsburg, Richard Phelan volunteered his services. He came to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, completed his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies at St. Mary's, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> at Pittsburg by Bishop O'Connor, 4 May, 1854. He served as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> to Bishop Tuigg. By a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 12 May, 1885, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Cybara, and by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 15 May, 1885, he was appointed coadjutor to Bishop Tuigg with right of succession, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Archbishop Ryan in St. Paul's Cathedral, Pittsburg, on 2 August, 1885. He succeeded as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the united Dioceses of Pittsburg and Allegheny, 7 December, 1889. By a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1 July, 1889, the See of Allegheny was totally suppressed, and the Diocese of Pittsburg was declared to embrace the territory of what had been the two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, as though no division had ever taken place. The administration of Bishop Phelan was a remarkably successful one. He was a man of prudent <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and extraordinary business ability. The people of many nationalities who were coming in large numbers to find work in the mines and mills of Western <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a> were formed into regular congregations, supplied with <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> who could speak their own languages, and the material and spiritual development of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> kept pace with the growth of the population. In May, 1901, the counties of Cambria, Blair, Bedford, Huntingdon, and Somerset were taken from the Diocese of Pittsburg to form, with several counties taken from the <a href="../cathen/07143a.htm">Diocese of Harrisburg</a>, the new <a href="../cathen/01368a.htm">Diocese of Altoona</a>, leaving the Diocese of Pittsburg its present territory (see beginning of this article).

<p>When Bishop Phelan, as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, began his work in the Diocese of Pittsburg, religious prejudice ran high, and misguided men said and did things against <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> which have passed into history. Placed in the most trying positions, he always disarmed bigotry by his straightforward adherence to the principles of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and charity towards all men, and by his considerate treatment of those who in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and worship were separated from him. His life as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was coincident with a remarkable transitional period in Western <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. No region has experienced so great changes within the last fifty years as has Western <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. During the administration of Bishop Phelan these changes were most marked. He saw the wonderful growth and development of the iron, steel, coal, and coke industries, to which the western portion of the state owes its distinction and prosperity. The sudden advent of immense <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> populations with strange tongues and strange customs, and all of them impoverished, gave rise to problems that would have taxed the ablest men. Here was a field in which Bishop Phelan showed his splendid administrative ability. By his wise and prudent counsel, by the exercise of judgment and foresight which in the light of events today are seen to have been of the first excellence, either the difficulties that arose were solved or the way for their solution was prepared. At his death, which occurred 20 December, 1904, at St. Paul's Orphan Asylum, Idlewood, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, he was the head of a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> which in organization, in the personnel of its <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and its adequate equipment for the needs of its people, was second to none in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. His vicars-general were Very Rev. Stephen Wall, Very Rev. F. L.  Tobin, and Very Rev. E. A.  Bush.

<p>The Right Rev. Regis Canevin, present (1911) <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Pittsburg, was born in Westmoreland County, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, 5 June, 1853, <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at St. Vincent's College and the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Beatty, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in St. Paul's Cathedral, Pittsburg, 4 June, 1879. He became coadjutor to Bishop Phelan, with right of succession, being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the same <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> by Archbishop Ryan, of Philadelphia, 24 February, 1903. His vicars-general are Rt. Rev. F. L.  Tobin and Rt. Rev. Joseph Suhr. The present <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population is about 475,000, and is composed of so many nationalities that the Gospel is preached in at least fourteen languages: English, German, French, Italian, Slovak, Polish, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a>, Magyar, Slovenian, Lithuanian, <a href="../cathen/04510a.htm">Croatian</a>, Rumanian, <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a>, and Syrian.
