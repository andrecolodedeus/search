<h1>Placide-Louis Chapelle</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">U.S.A.</a> b. at Runes Loz&egrave;re, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 28 August, 1842; d. at <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, 9 August, 1905. He began his classical studies at <a href="../cathen/10180a.htm">Mende</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and concluded them at Enghien, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. After a brilliant course of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at St. Mary's Seminary, <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, he received the degree of S.T.D. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, 28 June, 1865, he was sent as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> to St. John's Church, Rockville, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, and four years later was named <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Joseph's, Baltimore. In 1882 he was appointed to St. Matthew's, Washington, where he soon became the leading <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>. Dr. Chapelle was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> November, 1891, at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01676b.htm">Arabissus</a> and coadjutor to Archbishop Salpointe of Sante F&eacute;, <a href="../cathen/11001a.htm">New Mexico</a>, with the right of succession; he succeeded to that see, 7 January, 1894. He was transferred to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, 7 December, 1897. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> appointed him, 11 October 1898, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> to Cuba and Porto Rico and Envoy Extraordinary to the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>. He proved himself equal to this important and delicate mission. He spoke with facility French, Spanish, and English, was thoroughly acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the spirit of the American Constitution, and rendered valuable services to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. Being in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> during the negotiations for the treaty of peace between the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, he obtained the insertion therein of the clause which confirmed to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the possession of all properties to which she had a right under the Spanish Government. He was appointed by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, 9 August, 1899, and arrived at <a href="../cathen/09597b.htm">Manila</a>, 24 January, 1900. His first act was to persuade General Otis to liberate the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and religious held <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> by Aguinaldo. After reorganizing the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he helped greatly in the general pacification of the country. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> acknowledged and highly praised in a pontifical <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> the work of Archbishop Chapelle. His mission in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> being at an end, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> retained him as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> to Cuba and Porto Rico and named him Assistant to the Pontifical Throne and Count of the Holy Roman Empire. <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, in an autograph letter of 8 October, 1904, said to Archbishop Chapelle: "You have rendered most signal services to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/04558c.htm">Cuba</a> and Porto Rico." Though having an <a href="../cathen/02145b.htm">auxiliary bishop</a>, he wished to visit personally all the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of Louisiana, and he returned from <a href="../cathen/07153b.htm">Havana</a>, 30 May, 1905, to fulfil this pastoral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. Yellow fever had just broken out in <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, and he started without delay for the city, to be with his stricken people. He took the fever himself, and died, 9 August, 1905, after having in a pastoral, written four days before his death, offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> his life for his people.
