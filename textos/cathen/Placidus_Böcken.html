<h1>Placidus B&ouml;cken</h1>  

<p>(B<font size=-2>&Ouml;CKHN</font>).

<p>A German <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, canonist, and Vice-Chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, 13 July 1690, d. at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, 9 February, 1752. He entered the Order of St. Benedict at an early age, made his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> at the Abbey of St. Peter, <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, in 1706, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in 1713. Having been made a Doctor of Canon and Civil Law (1715), he was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and on his return was chosen, in 1721, to succeed the noted canonist Benedict Schmier, as professor of canon law at the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">University</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, where he remained for a period of twenty years. He proved himself a brilliant jurist, and an exceptionally gifted teacher. In 1729 he was appointed vice-chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. He was also attached to the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculties of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> and <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, was secretary of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and a valued <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> councillor of four successive <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> in the See of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> and of the Prince-Abbot of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>. Eventually he appears to have incurred the displeasure of Archbishop Leopold of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, and in consequence of repeated friction resigned his position in 1741. He was then made <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of Dornbach, a suburb of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, and, two years later, superior of Maria-Plain near <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, where he spent the last nine years of his life as confessor to the many <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> frequenting that famous shrine.

<p>The "Commentarius in Jus Canonicum universum" which B&ouml;cken published at <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> (1735-39), and dedicated to his friend and patron the Prince-Abbot of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, is his most important work. He had previously (1722-28) issued a number of separate treatises on the five books of the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a>, all written with great learning and care; these, now thoroughly revised and supplemented, were incorporated in his larger work, to the third volume of which, in an appendix, he also added a lengthy disquisition "De praescriptionibus". A reprint of the "Commentarius" appeared at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1776. B&ouml;cken's work like that of the Salzburg canonists generally, is one of definite value. B&ouml;cken held rather extreme views on the subject of the veneration due the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. He maintained that the special veneration and invocation of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, particularly of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>, is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. A sermon which he preached on this subject in 1740 precipitated an acrid discussion at the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> between the members of the "Old School" and the "New School" of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, between the Sycophantae and the <em>Illuminati</em> as they were called. The sermon appeared also in print, with annotations wherein B&ouml;cken characterized as <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> the contrary opinion of Muratori.
