<h1>Plagues of Egypt</h1>  

<p>Ten calamities inflicted on the Egyptians to overcome <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao's</a> obstinacy and force him to let the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> to leave <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (<a href="../bible/exo007.htm#vrs8">Exodus 7:8</a>-<a href="../bible/exo012.htm#vrs30">12:30</a>; <a href="../bible/psa077.htm#vrs42">Psalm 77:42-51</a>; <a href="../bible/psa104.htm#vrs26">104:26-36</a>). <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses's</a> notification of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> only produced an aggravation of the condition of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, and the wonder of changing Aaron's rod into a serpent, which was wrought in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of Moses's Divine mission, made no impression, as it was imitated by the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> magicians (<a href="../bible/exo005.htm">Exodus 5</a>; <a href="../bible/exo007.htm#vrs8">7:8-13</a>). A series of afflictions, culminating in the destruction of all the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, was required before <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> yielded.

<p>Of the ten plagues seven were produced through the agency of Moses an Aaron or of Moses alone, and three, namely the fourth, fifth, and tenth, by the direct action of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself. The interval of time within which they occurred cannot be stated with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. The last four must have followed in close succession between the beginning of March and the first days of April. For when the hail fell barley was in the ear and flax in bud, which in Lower <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> happens about March, and the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> left on the 14th of Nisan, which falls in the latter part of March or the early part of April. The first six seem also to have succeeded one another at short intervals, but the interval, if any, between them and the last four is uncertain. The Scriptural account produces the impression that the ten plagues were a series of blows in quick succession, and this is what the case would seem to have required. The scene of the interviews of Moses and Aaron with <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> was Tanis or Soan in Lower <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (Ps. lxxvii, 12, 43).

<p>In the <em>first</em> plague, the water of the river and of all the canals and pools of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> was turned to blood and became corrupted, so that the Egyptians could not drink it, and even the fishes died (<a href="../bible/exo007.htm#vrs14">Exodus 7:14-25</a>). Commentators are divided as to whether the water was really changed into blood, or whether only a phenomenon was produced similar to the red discoloration of the Nile during its annual rise, which gave the water the appearance of blood. The latter view is now commonly accepted. It should be noted, however, that the red discoloration is not usual in Lower <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and that, when so discoloured, the water is not unfit to drink, though it is during the first, or green, stage of the rise. Besides, the change did not take place during the inundation (cf. <a href="../bible/exo007.htm#vrs15">Exodus 7:15</a>). The <em>second</em> plague came seven days later. Aaron stretched his hand upon the waters and there appeared an immense number of frogs, which covered the land and penetrated into the land to the great discomfort of the inhabitants. <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> now promised to let the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> go to sacrifice in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> if the frogs were removed, but broke his promise when this was done. The <em>third</em> plague consisted of swarms of gnats which tormented man and beast. The magicians who in some way had imitated the first two wonders could not imitate this, and were forced to exclaim "This is the finger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". The <em>fourth</em> was a pest of flies. <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> now agreed to allow the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> a three days' journey into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, but when at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Moses the flies were taken away, he failed to keep his promise. The <em>fifth</em> was a murrain or cattle-pest, which killed the beasts of the Egyptians, while sparing those of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>. The <em>sixth</em> consisted in boils which broke out both on men and beasts. The <em>seventh</em> was a fearful hailstorm. "The hail destroyed through all the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> all things that were in the field, both man and beast: and the hail smote every herb of the field, and it broke every tree of the country. Only in the land of Gessen, where the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">children of Israel</a> were, the hail fell not." The frightened king again promised and again became obstinate when the storm was stopped. At the threat of an unheard of plague of locusts (the <em>eighth</em>) the servants of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> interceded with him and he consented to let the men go, but refused to grant more. Moses therefore stretched forth his rod, and a south wind brought innumerable locusts which devoured what the hailstorm had left. The <em>ninth</em> plague was a horrible darkness which for three days covered all <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> except the land of Gessen. The immediate cause of this plague was probably the hamsin, a south or south-west wind charged with sand and dust, which blows about the spring equinox and at times produces darkness rivalling that of the worst <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> fogs. As <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a>, though willing to allow the departure, insisted that the flocks should be left behind, the final and most painful blow (the <em>tenth</em>) was struck &#151; the destruction in one night of all the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.

<p>As the plagues of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> find parallels in natural phenomena of the country, many consider them as merely natural occurrences. The last evidently does not admit of a natural explanation, since a pestilence does not select its victims according to method. The others, howsoever natural they may be at times, must in this instance be considered <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> by reason of the manner in which they were produced. They belong to the class of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> call preternatural. For not to mention that they were of extraordinary intensity, and that the first occurred at an unusual time and place and with unusual effects, they happened at the exact time and in the exact manner predicted. Most of them were produced at Moses's command, and ceased at his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, in one case at the time set by <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> himself. Purely natural phenomena, it is clear, do not occur under such conditions. Moreover, the ordinary phenomena, which were well known to the Egyptians, would not have produced such a deep impression on <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharao</a> and his court.
