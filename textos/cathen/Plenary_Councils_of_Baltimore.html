<h1>Plenary Councils of Baltimore</h1>  

<p>While the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> comprised the whole territory of the American Republic, the provincial councils held in that city sufficed for the church government of the country. When, however, several ecclesiastical provinces had been formed, plenary council became a necessity for the fostering of common discipline. As a consequence, the Fathers of the Seventh <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> requested the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to sanction the holding of a <a href="../cathen/12164c.htm">plenary synod</a>. The petition was granted and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appointed <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> to convene and preside over the council.
<h2 id="section1">The First Plenary Council of Baltimore</h2>

<p>The First <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> opened on 9 May, 1852. Its sessions were attended by six <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and thirty-five suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Monterey, <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>, was also present, although his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, lately separated from Mexico, had not yet been incorporated with any American province. Another <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> in attendance was the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and congregations were represented by the mitred <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Mary of La Trappe and by the superiors of the Augustinians, <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorists</a>, <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Vincentians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13378a.htm">Sulpicians</a>. The last solemn session was held on the 20th of May. The decrees were as follows: <ol> <li>The Fathers profess their allegiance to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as the divinely constituted head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whose office it is to confirm his brethren in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. They also declare their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the entire <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> as explained by the ecumenical councils and the constitutions of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiffs</a>. <li>The enactments of the seven provincial councils of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> for all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. <li>The <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>, adopted by the First Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, is to be observed in all <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and all are forbidden to introduce customs or rites foreign to the Roman usage. Sacred ceremonies are not to be employed in the burial of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> whose bodies are deposited in sectarian cemeteries; or even in public cemeteries, if there be <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cemeteries at hand. <li>The Baltimore "Ceremonial" is to be used all through the country. <li>Bishops are to observe the canons concerning ecclesiastical residence. <li>Bishops are exhorted to choose consultors from among their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and to ask their advice in the government of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. A monthly meeting of these consultors to discuss <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> affairs is praiseworthy. <li>A chancellor should be constituted in every <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, for the easier and more orderly transaction of business. <li>Bishops should appoint censors for books relating to religion. <li><a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> desiring to be received into an American diocese must have written testimonials from their former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the consent of the ordinary here. <li>Our quasi-parishes should have well-defined limits, and the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> and privileges of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> should be indicated by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The ordinary can change these limits and it is his right to appoint the incumbents. <li>After next <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, <a href="../cathen/02255a.htm">matrimonial banns</a> must be published, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should dispense with this only for grave reasons. <li>Pastors themselves should teach <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> to the young and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. <li>Bishops are exhorted to have a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> and the teachers should be paid from the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> funds. <li>An <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminary</a> should be erected in each province. <li>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or their delegates should demand every year an account of the administration of church funds from those who administer them, whether <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. <li>Laymen are not to take any part in the administration of church affairs without the free consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. If they usurp any such authority and divert church goods to their own use or in any way frustrate the will of the donors; or if they, even under cover of the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, endeavour to wrest from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hands what has been confided to his care, then such <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> by that very fact fall under the censures constituted by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> against usurpers of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> goods. <li>When the title to a church is in the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> name, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> are warned not to appoint trustees or permit them to be elected without the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> authority. <li>Benediction of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> must be performed in all <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the manner prescribed by the Baltimore "Ceremonial". <li>Bishops should use their influence with the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> to prevent anyone in the army or navy from being <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to attend a religious service repugnant to his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. <li>A Society for the Propagation of the Faith, similar to that in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, should be fostered and extended. <li>The faithful are exhorted to enter into a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the conversion of non-Catholics. <li>A petition should be addressed to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> asking for extraordinary faculties concerning matrimonial cases and the power, also, of delegating such faculties. <li>Permission to use the short formula in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of adults is to be requested of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, either for perpetuity or for twenty years. <li>The sixth <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Seventh <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">Provincial Council</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> is to be understood as applying to those who rashly (<em>temere</em>) marry before a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> minister. Priests should give no benediction to those whom they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to intend to remarry before a preacher, or who, having done so, show no signs of penitence. <li>These decrees are binding as soon as they are published by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> after their revision and approval by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. </ol> In sending the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> approval of these decrees, the prefect of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> exhorted the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to add the feasts of the Circumcision of Our Lord and the Immaculate Conception B.V.M. to the festivals already observed. He added that although some diversity as to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> and feasts is found in the American <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, still it is not desirable to lessen the number in those places where they are in accord with the discipline of the universal Church, because fewer feasts are observed in other American <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are not to labour for conformity among the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in customs that are foreign to the discipline of the universal Church, for thus the appearance of a national Church would be introduced. The cardinal-prefect added that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> tolerated relaxations of the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for grave reasons, but such derogations were not to be confirmed and extended, but rather every effort was to be made to bring about the observance of the universal discipline. As to the method of adult <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> extended the <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> to use the short formula for another five years.



<p>A letter from Cardinal-Prefect Franzoni, added to the acts of the council, treats of the question of how the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are to be supported by their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. It likewise insists that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <em>titulo missionis</em> are not to enter <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders without the consent of their ordinaries, as they are required to make <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that they will serve perpetually in the diocese for which they were <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. In the acts of this council is found a statement of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Monterey concerning the <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> Missions. He informed the Fathers that a large sum of money had formerly been placed in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/10250b.htm">Mexican</a> Government to be used under the sanction of Spanish law for the support of the <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">Californian</a> missionaries. For years they had received none of this money and the late revolutions made any hope of reparation unlikely. However, as it is reported that the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> in <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> intends to demand this money from the Mexican treasury for public purposes, he desired to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what effort the American <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> thought it desirable to make in the premises. The outcome of the whole discussion was the sending of a letter on the subject to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10269a.htm">Mexico</a>. We may add here that this money was later recovered and employed for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">CALIFORNIA</a> sub-title <em>History</em>.)
<h2 id="section2">The Second Plenary Council of Baltimore</h2>

<p>The Second Plenary Council was presided over by Archbishop Spalding of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> as Delegate Apostolic. It was opened on the 7th of October and closed on 21 October, 1866. The acts note that, at the last solemn session, Andrew Johnson, President of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, was among the auditors. The decrees of this council were signed by seven <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, thirty-nine <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or their procurators, and two <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>. The decrees are divided into fourteen titles and subdivided into chapters.

<p>Title i, Concerning the Orthodox Faith and Present Errors, declares the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> (cap. i) on <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a> and the one <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; (ii) the nature and necessity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; (iii) the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>; (iv) the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a>; (v) the future life; (vi) the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> invocation and veneration of the B.V. Mary and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. (vii) The seventh chapter in which the present <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> are discussed treats of (a) the dissensions among the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> and of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for their conversion. (b) <a href="../cathen/07759a.htm">Indifferentism</a>. The Fathers warn their flock against the teaching that one religion is as good as another provided one be honest and just to his neighbour. They call this a plague, spreading under the guise of charity and benevolence. (c) <a href="../cathen/15154b.htm">Unitarianism</a> and Universalism. These theories the first denying the divinity of Christ and the other eternal punishment, tend to the rejection of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> in religion. (d) Transcendentalism and <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>. These are the systems of men, who having dethroned <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, make a deity of man. (e) Abuse of magnetism. The faithful are warned that magnetism is often employed for <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> and illicit purposes, namely, to forecast the future by means of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> "mediums". (f) The hallucination and dangers of <a href="../cathen/14221a.htm">spiritism</a>. There is little reason to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that some of the phenomena of <a href="../cathen/14221a.htm">spiritism</a> are the work of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. It is noteworthy that the leaders of this system deny either implicitly or explicitly the divinity of Christ and the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> in religion.

<p>Title ii, Concerning the Hierarchy and the Government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, treats (cap. i) of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>; (ii) of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> teaching and ruling; (iii) of provincial councils, which ought to be held every three years; (iv) of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, in which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> alone is legislator and judge. This chapter also treats of quarterly conferences for the discussion of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> questions by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. (v) The officials of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> are considered in this chapter. Besides the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consultors and the <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should appoint vicars forane or rural deans who are to preside at <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> conferences, to watch over <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>, to counsel the junior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and report annually to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on the state of their districts. Other officials mentioned are the secretary, chancellor, notary, and <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> for temporal affairs. Synodal examiners and judges for the criminal cases of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> are also to be constituted. The latter, by delegation of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, hold courts of the first instance and they should follow a judicial method closely approximating that prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>.

<p>Title iii, Concerning Ecclesiastical Persons, is divided into seven chapters. (cap. i) Of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>. (ii) Of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; they are to make a visitation of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> frequently; they should provide support for aged and infirm priests; before death they should appoint an administrator sede vacante for their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. If this has not been done, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> is to make the appointment, or if it be a question of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> church itself, then the senior suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> constitutes an administrator until the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> can provide. The administrator cannot make innovations in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. (iii) Of the election of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. A method for episcopal nominations to American sees is given, as also the requisite qualifications for candidates. (iv) Of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> exercising the sacred ministry. When several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> serve a church, one only must be designated as <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. Priests should often preach to their people; they must not marry or <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> the faithful of other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Although our missions are not canonical <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, yet it is the desire of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to conform as much as possible to the discipline of the universal church in this matter. In cities containing more than one church, accurate limits for their districts should be assigned. When in these decrees the terms "parish" or "parochial <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>" are used, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have no intention of thereby indicating that the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of a church is irremovable. No <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should be appointed to a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> unless he has made an examination before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and has been five years in the diocese. This does not apply to regulars. (v) Of preaching. While explaining the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, preachers should also treat fully of points denied by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or unbelievers. Their style, however, is not to be controversial but explanatory. In their method they should follow the <a href="../cathen/13120c.htm">Roman Catechism</a> and make a careful study of the writings of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>. Let them accommodate themselves to the capacity of their auditors. In reprehending vices, let them never become personal; neither should they be influenced in their preaching by human motives but declare the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> fearlessly. They are not to mingle political and civil matters with religious doctrines in their sermons or attack public magistrates. While the custom of delivering funeral orations is to be retained, yet care must be taken not to bestow undue praise. In all sermons let prolixity be avoided. (vi) Of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> life and manners. Clerics are to avoid a dress and personal appearance not becoming their station. They should abstain from all improper spectacles and games. Let them avoid having recourse to civil tribunals when possible. They must not engage in trade forbidden by the canons. Let them not be importunate in speaking of money matters to their flocks. The custom of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> taking money on deposit, for which 'interest is to be paid, is condemned. Let <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> observe the prescriptions of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> concerning their households. All <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> should avoid idleness as a pest. (vii) Of <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">ecclesiastical seminaries</a>. The erection of preparatory as well as greater <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> is recommended. Theology and philosophy, Scripture and Hebrew are to be taught in the latter. No student is to pass from one <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> to another without testimonial letters. In those <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> where Germans are found who cannot speak English, it is expedient that the seminarians learn enough German to hear <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">confessions</a>.

<p>Title iv, Of Ecclesiastical Property.-The decrees of the first seven councils of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> concerning the abuses of lay trustees and of the best method of securing <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> by civil sanction are repeated and re-enacted. As to lay trustees, they must not be members of <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a> nor men who have not fulfilled the paschal <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. They cannot expend a sum of money above three hundred dollars without written consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, not the trustees, appoints <a href="../cathen/11297a.htm">organist</a>, singers, <a href="../cathen/13322a.htm">sacristan</a>, school-teachers, and others employed about the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. When difference of opinion exists between <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> and trustees, all must abide by the decision of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. All misunderstanding between the ordinary and regulars concerning temporal affairs will be averted if, at the founding of a new house, a document be drawn up expressing clearly all that relates to the foundation itself, to the rights thence flowing and to the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> connected with it.

<p>Title v, Of the Sacraments.-(i) The <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a> and the Baltimore "Ceremonial" are to be followed. Pastors should keep registers of baptisms, confirmations, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, and funerals. All of these, except the last, should be written in Latin. (ii) Of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. It must always be conferred in the church except in case of imminent death. Whether for infants or adults, all rites omitted at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> must be afterwards supplied. As a rule converts are to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; but care must be taken to inquire if they had been previously validly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, lest the sacrament be repeated. The same is to be said of those <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in danger of death by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>. Churching after child-birth, which has been generally neglected in this country, is to be insisted upon. (iii) Of confirmation. Sponsors of the same sex as the recipient are to be employed. (iv) Of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>. Frequent Communion is to be encouraged. Children should as a rule be admitted to First Communion between ten and fourteen years of age. (v) Of penance. (vi) Of indulgences. Preachers must be careful not to recommend <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> or fictitious <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>. Let them propose such as the faithful can gain most frequently, easily, and with greatest fruit. (vii) Of extreme unction. Olive oil is required for this sacrament. The Fathers commend the proposition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13488a.htm">Savannah</a> to establish a community of <a href="../cathen/15024a.htm">Trappists</a> on lands near St. Augustine, <a href="../cathen/06115b.htm">Florida</a>, who would supply genuine olive oil, wine, and beeswax candles for the use of the churches. (viii) Of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>. Clerics cannot be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> without a canonical title. By Apostolic <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, our <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have thus far been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> titulo missionis for the most part. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is to be petitioned for a continuation of this privilege. (ix) Of Matrimony. Rules are laid down for determining <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> concerning the probable death of soldiers in the late civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Mixed marriages are to be discouraged. (x) Of the <a href="../cathen/13292d.htm">sacramentals</a>.

<p>Title vi, Of Divine Worship.-(i) Of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>. Priests are never to leave the altar to collect <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Our quasi-parish-priests are not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to apply their Mass for their flock on festival days. (ii) Of Benediction and the Forty Hours' Exposition. The latter is to be performed according to the manner sanctioned by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for the <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Diocese of Baltimore</a>. (iii) Of <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>. The rudiments of the <a href="../cathen/06779a.htm">Gregorian chant</a> should be taught in the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>.

<p>Title vii, Of Promoting Uniformity of Discipline.- (i) Of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> and feasts. Those now in use in each province are to be retained. The Patronal Feast of the Immaculate Conception is, however, to be celebrated in every <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> as of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. (ii) Of uniformity in other matters. Bishops should endeavour to use a uniform method of acting in granting matrimonial <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> may be buried with sacred rites in non-Catholic cemeteries if they possess a lot in them, provided it was not acquired in contempt of church law. The poor must be buried gratuitously. Entrance money should not be collected at churches. <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">Orphans</a> are to be cared for. Faculties for blessing cemeteries and church bells may be <a href="../cathen/04696b.htm">delegated</a> to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p>Title viii, Of Regulars and Nuns.-(i) When a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community has accepted a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> work, strictly so called, it should not relinquish it without giving the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> notice six months beforehand. A clear distinction is to be made as to what <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> belongs to a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> community and what to the diocese. (ii) Nuns are not to make solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> until ten years after the taking of simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. Bishops are not to permit religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to travel around soliciting <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>.

<p>Title ix, Of the Education of Youth.-(i) Of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Teachers belonging to religious congregations should be employed when possible in our <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The latter should be erected in every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. For children who attend the public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> classes should be instituted in the churches. (ii) Industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> or reformatories should be founded, especially in large cities. (iii) A desire is expressed to have a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.

<p>Title x, Of Procuring the Salvation of Souls.-(i) Of seal for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. (ii) Missions in <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> are to be encouraged; missionaries must not, however, interfere in the administration of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. (iii) Various confraternities and sodalities are named and recommended and regulations are given for their institution. (iv) Priests, both <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a>, are exhorted to endeavour to further the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> in our midst.

<p>Title xi, Of Books and Newspapers.-(i) Parents should guard their children against bad books. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> desire that textbooks in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and colleges should be purged of everything contrary to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. (ii) Of the dissemination of good books. (iii) <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> books should not be published until officially revised. (iv) Newspapers are frequently injurious to good <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. When a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> newspaper has a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>, this means only that he judges that nothing will be published against <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> in its pages. He does not make himself responsible, however, for all that the paper contains.

<p>Title xii, Of Secret Societies.-The <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasons</a> were long ago condemned by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The Odd Fellows and Sons of Temperance are also forbidden <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. In general, the faithful may not enter any <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> which, having designs against Church or State, binds its members by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of secrecy.

<p>Title xiii, Concerning the Creation of New Bishoprics.

<p>Title xiv, Of the Execution of the Conciliar Decrees.- A number of important instructions and <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> are appended to the <a href="../cathen/01114c.htm">Acts</a> of this council.
<h2 id="section3">The Third Plenary Council of Baltimore</h2>

<p>The Third Plenary Council was presided over by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a>, Archbishop Gibbons of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. Its decrees were signed by fourteen <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, sixty-one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or their representatives, six <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and one general of a religious congregation. The first solemn session was held 9 November, and the last 7 December, 1884. Its decrees are divided into twelve titles.

<p>Preliminary Title. All the decrees of the Second Plenary Council remain in force except such as are abrogated or changed by the present council.

<p>Title i, Of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>.

<p>Title ii, Of Ecclesiastical Persons.-(i) Of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. When a see becomes vacant, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> will call together the consultors and irremovable rectors of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and they shall choose three names which are to be forwarded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and to the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province. The latter shall meet together and discuss the candidates. If they wish, they may reject all the names proposed by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and substitute others, but they must give their reasons for this action when sending their recommendation to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. (ii) Of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> consultors. They should be six or at least four in number. If this be impossible, however, two will suffice. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> chooses the consultors, half at his own option, the other half after <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should ask the advice of his consultors as to holding and <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgating</a> a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod; dividing <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; committing a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> to religious; constituting a committee for <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>; choosing new consultors or examiners non-synodically; concerning transactions about church-property where the sum involved exceeds five thousand dollars; exacting new episcopal taxes beyond the limits designated by the canons. Consultors hold office for three years and they may not be removed except for grave reasons. They are to vote collectively. When the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> is vacant, the administrator must ask their counsel in all the above-mentioned cases. (iii) Of examiners of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. They are to be six in number. Their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> are principally to examine the junior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the candidates for irremovable rectorships. (iv) Of deans and vicars forane. The institution of these district officials is recommended to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. It is advisable to bestow on them some faculties beyond what other rectors have and some honorary pre-eminence. (v) Of irremovable rectors. Parishes to have such rectors must have a proper church, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for boys and girls, and revenues sufficiently stable for the support of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, church, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. In all <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> every tenth <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> should be irremovable if the requisite conditions are obtainable. The candidate for such rectorship must have been in the ministry ten years and shown himself a satisfactory administrator in spirituals and temporals. He must also make a prescribed examination (<em>concursus</em>). An irremovable <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> cannot be removed from his office except for a canonical cause and according to the mode of procedure contained in the Instruction "Cum Magnopere". (vi) Of the concursus. The examination for irremovable rectorships must take place before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and three examiners. Candidates must reply to questions in dogmatic and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, liturgy, and canon law. They are also to give a specimen of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> exposition and of preaching. The qualities of the candidates are also to be weighed in forming a judgment. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is to give the vacant rectorship only to a candidate who has received the approving votes of the examiners. (vii) Of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. 1. Priests <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> for a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are bound by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to remain in it. 2. Alien <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> bringing satisfactory testimonials from former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> may be incardinated in a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> only after a probation of three or five years, and formal adscription by the ordinary. We may note that this council speaks of presumptive incardination also, but by a later Roman <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> (20 July, 1898) that form of adscription is abrogated. 3. Infirm <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should be cared for. 4. Unworthy <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have no just claims to support, yet if they wish to amend, a house governed by regulars should be provided for them. (viii) Of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> life and manners. Priests should make a spiritual retreat once every year, or at least every two years. They are exhorted to give themselves to solid reading and study. They are to avoid conduct that can afford even the least suspicion of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. They are not to bring an action against another cleric before a civil tribunal about temporal matters without written permission of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. As to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, they are to remember that judgment pertains only to the church authorities. (ix) Of regulars. The provisions of the papal constitution "Romanos Pontifices" are extended to the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. This constitution treats of the exemption of regulars from episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>; of what concerns their ministry in a diocese; and of their temporal possessions. All controversies on these subjects are to be referred to the prefect of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. Bishops are to recur to him also in matters concerning institutes of simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> that are not <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> but have their own superior-general. Diocesan Institutes, even having a rule approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, are entirely subject to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the ordinary. Bishops are to see that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of enclosure (<em>clausura</em>) are observed. Regulations are laid down for the ordinary and extraordinary confessors of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. Those who belong to religious brotherhoods, whose members are forbidden to aspire to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, may not, after leaving such congregation, be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> for any diocese without a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>Title iii, Of Divine Worship.-(i) Of celebrating Mass twice on the same day. (ii) Of uniformity in feasts and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>. In future in all <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of this country there are to be the following six feasts of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> and no others: The Immaculate Conception, <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, Circumcision of Our Lord (New Year's Day), <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension</a>, Assumption, and <a href="../cathen/01315a.htm">All Saints' Day</a>. No new dispositions are made as to fast days. (iii) Of the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Lord's Day</a>. The faithful are to be exhorted to observe it properly. (iv) Of <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">sacred music</a>. Profane melodies are forbidden. The music should accord with the sacredness of time and place. Psalms are not to be curtailed at <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a>. The Mass must not be interrupted by the length of the choir-singing.

<p>Title iv, Of the Sacraments.-(i) Of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of converts. The ritual prescribed for their reception into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is to be observed. (ii) Of matrimony. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who marry before a sectarian minister are <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Mixed marriages are not to be contracted unless promises are given that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party is in no danger of perversion, and will strive to convert the non-Catholic party. Also that all the children born of the union are to be brought up <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. No <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from these promises can be given.

<p>Title v, Of the Education of Clerics.-(i) Preparatory <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> should be instituted. The pupils should be taught <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian Doctrine</a>, English, and at least one other language according to the necessities of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. They must learn to speak and write Latin. Greek is also to be taught. The usual branches of profane learning, not omitting the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, as well as music and the <a href="../cathen/06779a.htm">Gregorian chant</a> are to be part of the curriculum. (ii) Of the greater <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. Judgment must be exercised in admitting aspirants to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and they must be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> formed to virtue and learning. Two years are to be devoted to a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and four to a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> course. The faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> is to embrace dogmatic and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">Biblical exegesis</a>, <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, canon law, liturgy and sacred eloquence. Great care must he taken in the selection of spiritual directors and professors for the students. Examinations are to be held semi-annually or annually in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and the examiners of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Students are to be warned to spend their vacations in a manner becoming the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> profession. The temporal and spiritual administration of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> belongs principally to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; he is to be aided by two commissions, one for spirituals and one for temporals. (iii) Of the principal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> or <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. The Fathers consider the times ripe for creating a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, and for this purpose they appoint a commission. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> is to be entirely under the management of the episcopate. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should, however, continue to send some of their subjects to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08024b.htm">Innsbruck</a>, as the new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> is intended for postgraduate <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies. (iv) Of the examinations of the junior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. For five years after <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> must make an annual examination in Scripture, dogmatic and <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, canon law, <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, and liturgy. (v) Of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> conferences. All <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> having <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> must attend <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> meetings for the discussion of questions of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and discipline. These conferences are to be held four times a year in urban and twice a year in rural districts.

<p>Title vi, Of the Education of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Youth, treats of (i) <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, especially <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a>, viz., of their absolute necessity and the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> to establish them. Parents must send their children to such <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> unless the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should judge the reason for sending them elsewhere to be sufficient. Ways and means are also considered for making the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> more efficient. It is desirable that these <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> be free. (ii) Every effort must be made to have suitable <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> youth.

<p>Title vii, Of Christian Doctrine.-(i) Of the office of preaching. (ii) A commission is appointed to prepare a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> for general use. When published it is to be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>. (iii) Of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> books. (iv) Of books and newspapers. While objectionable writings are to be condemned, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> should oppose them also by <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> newspapers and books.

<p>Title viii, Of Zeal for Souls.-(i) Immigrants should be instructed by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of their own language. (ii) A commission is appointed to aid the missions among Indians and <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">Negroes</a>. (iii) Censures against <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a> are to be made known to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. If <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> has not condemned a particular <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> by name, it will belong only to a commission consisting of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of the country to decide whether it falls under the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of forbidden organizations or not. If they cannot agree, the matter is to be referred to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, especially those of temperance, are to be encouraged.

<p>Title ix, Of Church Property.-(i) The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> right to hold <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. (ii) The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is the guardian and supreme administrator of all <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. (iii) Priests are diligently to guard <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. If they do not request their salary at the proper time, they are supposed to have renounced their right to it. (iv) In choosing lay trustees only those members of the congregation have a voice, who, being twenty-one years of age, have fulfilled the paschal precept, have paid for a seat in the church during the past year, have sent their children to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and belong to no prohibited <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> is <em>ex officio</em> president of the board of trustees. (v) In all churches some seats must be set aside for the poor. Abuses incident to picnics, excursions, and fairs are to be guarded against. Balls are not to be given for religious purposes. It is a detestable abuse to refuse the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to those who will not contribute to collections. Bishops are to determine the stipend proper for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ministries. Foreign <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or religious cannot solicit <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> in a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> without the consent of the ordinary.

<p>Title x, Of Ecclesiastical Trials.-(i) Every <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is to have an episcopal tribunal. (ii) Its officials for disciplinary cases are to be a judge, fiscal <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> or <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> attorney, attorney for the accused, and a chancellor. To those may be added an auditor, a notary, and <a href="../cathen/01650c.htm">apparitors</a>. For matrimonial cases the officials are to be an auditor, defender of the marriage tie, and a notary. The interested parties may also employ advocates. (iii) In criminal causes, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, according as the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and case demand, may proceed either extra-judicially or judicially. This chapter describes the method to be employed in both instances.

<p>Title xi, Of Ecclesiastical Sepulture.-Cemeteries should be properly cared for.

<p>Title xii. The decrees of this council are binding as soon as they are <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by the Delegate Apostolic. At the request of the Fathers, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> permitted the celebration in the <a href="../cathen/07380a.htm">United States</a> of the feasts of <a href="../cathen/12006b.htm">St. Philip of Jesus</a>, St. Turibius, and St. Francis Solano. It also granted to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, under certain conditions, the power of alienating church goods without previously referring each case to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The Fathers of this council signed the <a href="../cathen/12319c.htm">postulation</a> for the introduction of the cause of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> of <a href="../cathen/08420b.htm">Isaac Jogues</a> and <a href="../cathen/06684a.htm">Ren&eacute; Goupil</a>, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/14471a.htm">Catherine Tegakwitha</a>, an <a href="../cathen/08168b.htm">Iroquois</a> virgin. This Third Plenary Council exhibits the actual canon law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.
