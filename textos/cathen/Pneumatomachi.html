<h1>Pneumatomachi</h1>  

<p>(Macedonians)</p>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> which flourished in the countries adjacent to the Hellespont during the latter half of the fourth, and the beginning of the fifth century. They denied the divinity of the Holy Ghost, hence the name <em>Pneumatomachi</em> or Combators against the Spirit.

<p>Macedonius, their founder, was intruded into the See of Constantinople by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> (342 A.D.), and <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> by Constantius, who had for the second time expelled Paul, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He is known in history for his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatians</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; as both maintained the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">consubstantiality</a> of the Son with the Father. He not only expelled those who refused to hold communion with him, but <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> some and brought others before the tribunals. In many cases he used torture to compel the unwilling to communicate, forced <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> on unbaptized <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children and destroyed many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>. At last his cruelty provoked a rebellion of the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatians</a> at Mantinium, in Paphlagonia, in which four imperial cohorts were defeated and nearly all slain. His disinterment of the body of Constantine was looked upon as an indignity to the Protector of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>, and led to a conflict between <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and anti-Arians, which filled the church and neighbourhood with carnage. As the disinterment had taken place without the emperor's sanction, Macedonius fell into disgrace, and Constantius <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be deposed by the Acacian party and succeeded by Eudoxius in 360. This deposition, however, was not for <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> reasons, but on the ground that he had caused much bloodshed and had admitted to communion a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> guilty of fornication. Macedonius continued for some time to live near Constantinople and cause trouble. He died about 364. It is thought that during these last years he formulated his rejection of the Divinity of the Holy Ghost and founded his <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. His intimacy with Eleusius of Cysicus makes this probable. Some scholars, however, reject the identification of Macedonians and Pneumatomachians, apparently on insufficient grounds and against the authority of <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, a contemporary historian living at Constantinople. The Council of Nicaea had used all its energies in defending the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">Homoousion</a> of the Son and with regard to the Spirit had already added the words: "We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the Holy Ghost" without any qualification. The Macedonians took advantage of the vagueness and hesitancy of statement in some of the early Fathers to justify and propagate their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. The majority of this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> were clearly <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> on the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">Consubstantiality</a> of the Son; they had sent a deputation from the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a> council of <a href="../cathen/08770b.htm">Lampsacus</a> (364 A.D.) to <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Pope Liberius</a>, who after some hesitation acknowledged the soundness of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but with regard to the Third Person, both <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were satisfied with the phrase: "We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the Holy Ghost." While hiding in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> during his third exile, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> learned form his friend Serapion of Thumis of a <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> acknowledging Nicaea, and yet declaring the Holy Ghost a mere creature and a <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">ministering angel</a> (on the strength of <a href="../bible/heb001.htm#vrs14">Hebrews 1:14</a>). <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> wrote at once to Serapion in defence of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Doctrine, and on his return from exile (362 A.D.) held a council at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> which resulted in the first formal condemnation of the Pneumatomachi. A synodal letter was sent to the people of Antioch advising them to require of all converts from <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> a condemnation against "those who say that the Holy Spirit is a creature and separate from the essence of Christ. For those who while pretending to cite the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> confessed at <a href="../cathen/11043a.htm">Nicaea</a>, venture to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the Holy Spirit, deny <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> in words only, while in thought they return to it." Nevertheless, during the following decade the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> seems to have gone on almost unchecked except in the Patriarchate of Antioch where at a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in 363 Meletius had proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. In the East the moving spirit for the repression of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> was <a href="../cathen/01438a.htm">Amphilochius of Iconium</a>, who in 374 besought <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a> of Caesarea to write a treatise on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Holy Ghost. This he did, and his treatise is the classical work on the subject (<em>peri tou hagiou</em> II. M. 32). It is possible that he influenced his brother <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">Gregory of Nyssa</a> to write his treatise against the Macedonians, of which only a part has come down to us and which appears to be based on the words: "Lord and life-giver who proceeds from the Father." These words, apparently taken from the Creed of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, had been used by <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius of Salamis</a> in his "Ancoratus" when combating this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> (374 A. D.). <a href="../cathen/01438a.htm">Amphilochius of Iconium</a>, as <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of Lycaonia, wrote in concurrence with his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> a synodal letter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Lycia, which contains and excellent statement of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> (377 A. D.). In Constantinople (379) <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a> pronounced his brilliant <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> oration on this subject. The West likewise upheld the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a> and mentioned by Theodoret (<a href="../fathers/27024.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.8</a>) and by Pope Damasus in his letter to Paulinus of Antioch. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was condemned in the <a href="../cathen/04308a.htm">First Council of Constantinople</a>, and internal divisions soon led to its extinction. <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> (<a href="../fathers/26015.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.24</a>) states that a certain Macedonian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, Eutropius, held conventicles of his own while others followed Bishop Carterius. <a href="../cathen/05628b.htm">Eustathius of Sebaste</a>, Sabinus, and Eleusius of Cyricus seem to have been leaders whom the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> repudiated (for Eustathis, see Basil, Ep., CCLXIII, 3). In June 383 <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> tried by means of a conference to bring the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> factions to submission. Eleusius handed in his symbol of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as representing the Macedonians, as he had represented them with Marcianus of <a href="../cathen/08770b.htm">Lampsacus</a> at the Council of Constantinople. After this fruitless attempt at reconciliation the Macedonians with other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> incurred all the severities of the Theodosian code and with a generation disappeared from history. <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> and <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomus</a> mention a certain Marathonius, made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> by Macedonius, who obtained such a leading position in the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> that they were often styled after him Marathonians. Through <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, St. Augustine, St. Damasus, and Rufinus, the name Macedonians became the customary designation in the West. No writings of Macedonius are extant, but Pneumatomachian writings are mentioned by Didymus the Blind, who wrote an excellent treatise on the Holy Ghost in thirty-six chapters (translated into Latin by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> at the command of Pope Damasus), and who refers in his later work (379) on the Trinity (II, 7, 8, 10) to some "Brief Expositions" of Macedonian doctrines which he possessed.
