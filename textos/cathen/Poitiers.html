<h1>Poitiers</h1>  

<p>D<font size=-2>IOCESE OF</font> P<font size=-2>OITIERS</font> (P<font size=-2>ICTAVENSIS</font>)

<p>The Diocese of Poitiers includes the Departments of Vienne and Deux-S&egrave;vres, and is suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>. The Concordat of 1802 added to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> besides the ancient Diocese of Poitiers a part of the <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">Diocese of La Rochelle</a> and Saintes (see <a href="../cathen/09006a.htm">LA ROCHELLE</a>). Mgr Duchesne holds that its earliest episcopal catalogue represents the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">ecclesiastical tradition</a> of Poitiers in the twelfth century. The catalogue reckons twelve predecessors of St. Hilary, among them Nectarius, Liberius, and Agon, and among his successors Sts. Quintianus and Maxentius. Mgr Duchesne does not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the existence of these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> but questions whether they were <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Poitiers. According to him, St. Hilary (350-67 or 8) is the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of whom we have historical evidence. Among his successors were St. Pientius (c. 544-60); St. Fortunatus (c. 599); St. Peter (1087-1115), exiled by William IX, Count of Poitiers, whose <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> he refused to sanction; Gilbert de la Porr&eacute;e (1142-54); Blessed William Tempier (1184-97), who, as <a href="../cathen/10525a.htm">Mgr. Barbier de Montault</a> has shown, was irregularly <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a saint in certain parts of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> since he died subsequent to the declaration of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> which reserved canonizations to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; Blessed Gauthier de <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a> (1278-1306); Arnauld d'Aux (1306-12), made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1312; Guy de Malsec (1371-5), who became <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1375; <a href="../cathen/13799a.htm">Simon de Cramaud</a> (1385-91), indefatigable opponent of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, and who again administered the diocese (1413-23) and became <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1413; Louis de Bar (1394-5), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1397; Jean de la Tr&eacute;mouille (1505-7), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1507; Gabriel de Gramont (1532-4), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1507; Claude de Longway, Cardinal de Givry (1538-52), became <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1533; Antonio Barberini (1652-7), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1627; Abb&eacute; de Pradt (1805-9), afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, Pie (1849-80), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1879. <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a> was a native of Poitiers, but according to to the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> and Mgr Duchesne the documents which make him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Poitiers (c. 650) are not trustworthy; on the other hand Bernard Sepp (Analec. Boll., VIII) and Dom Chamard claim that he did hold the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and succeeded <a href="../cathen/04782a.htm">Didon</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> about 666 or 668 according to Dom Chamard.

<p>As early as 312 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Poitiers established a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> near his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>; among its scholars were St. Hilary, St. Maxentius, Bishop Maximus of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and his two brothers <a href="../cathen/10077a.htm">St. Maximinus</a> of Chinon and St. John of Marne, St. Paulinus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and the poet Ausonius. In the sixth century <a href="../cathen/06149a.htm">Fortunatus</a> taught there, and in the twelfth century <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> flocked to Poitiers to sit at the feet of Gilbert de la Porr&eacute;e. Charles VII erected a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at Poitiers, in opposition to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where the majority of the faculty had hailed Henry VI of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 28 May, 1431, <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a> approved the new <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In the reign of Louis XII there were in Poitiers no less than four thousand students &mdash; French, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, Flemings, Scots, and Germans. There were ten colleges attached to the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. In 1540, at the Coll&egrave;ge Ste. Marthe, the famous Marc Antoine* Muret, whom <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> called in later years the torch and the pillar of the Roman School, had a chair. The famous <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/09567a.htm">Maldonatus</a> and five of his confr&egrave;res went in 1570 to Poitiers to establish a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at the request of some of the inhabitants. After two unsuccessful attempts, they were given the Coll&egrave;ge Ste. Marthe in 1605. P&egrave;re Garasse, well known for his violent polemics and who died of the plague at Poitiers in 1637, was professor there (1607-8), and had as a pupil the great French prose writer, Guez de Balzac. Among other students at Poitiers were Achille de Harlay, President de Thou, the poet Joachim du Bellay, the chronicler, Brantome <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Descartes</a>, Vi&egrave;te the mathematician, and <a href="../cathen/02192a.htm">Bacon</a>, afterwards Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. In the seventeenth century the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> sought affiliation with the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> and in spite of the lively opposition of the faculties of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and arts their request was granted. <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> ascendancy grew; they united to Ste. Marthe the Coll&egrave;ge du Puygareau. Friction between them and the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was continuous, and in 1762 the general <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against them throughout <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> led to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> leaving Poitiers. Moreover, from 1674 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had conducted at Poitiers a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> students from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. In 1806 the State reopened the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of law at Poitiers and later the faculties of literature and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. These faculties were raised to the rank of a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> in 1896. From 1872 to 1875 Cardinal Pie was engaged in re-establishing the faculty of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. As a provisional effort he called to teach in his Grand S&eacute;minaire three professors from the Collegio Romano, among them <a href="../cathen/13590a.htm">P&egrave;re Schrader</a>, the commentator of the Syllabus, who died at Poitiers in 1875.



<p>At Ligug&eacute; in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, St. Martin founded the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, to which were attached a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechetical</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and a <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a>. This <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, afterwards eclipsed by that of Marmoutiers founded by St. Martin near <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, was destroyed by the Normans in 865, and was later a simple <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> depending on the Abbey of Maillezais, and still later belonged to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. In 1853 the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> settled in Ligug&eacute; and in 1856 it became an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> of Ligug&eacute;, driven out in 1880, took refuge at Silos in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in after years became once more a religious centre, but the Associations Law of 1901 again forced the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> into exile at Chevetogne in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. Another important <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was that of Ansion, or St. Jouin of Marne, founded before 500, and subsequently placed under the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>. St. Generosus, St. Paternus (Pair), afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Avranches, his friend St. Scubilio, and St. Aichard, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Jumi&egrave;ges, were all <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Ansion. A <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> founded in 785 by Roger, Count of <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, and his wife Euphrasia, was the origin of the town of Charroux, and was enriched with many gifts by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. The Abbey of St. Savin-sur-Gartempe, was founded by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. Its church and <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>, studied in 1836 by Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, dates from the eleventh century, and possesses a series of frescoes of the eleventh and twelfth centuries representing the history of the world from the creation until Moses, and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of SS. Savinus and Cyprian, which are unique in the history of French mural <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter of Chauvigny (eleventh and twelfth centuries) has some admirable <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> work; and the town of Poitiers is a veritable museum of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">religious art</a>. Parts of the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> of St. John, recently studied with care by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/01688a.htm">archeologist</a>, P. de la Croix, date from the fourth century; and there is evidence that in the time of Constantine <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by immersion was practised in Poitiers.

<p>The church founded in the fourth century by St. Hilary in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of SS. John and Paul, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and where St. Hilary was buried, was afterwards dedicated to St. Hilary, and reconstructed in the eleventh century by Emma, Queen of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and mother of Edward the Confessor, and by her architect Gautier Coorland. The vaulting of the seven <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> of this building, known today as St. Hilary the Great, reminds one of Byzantine <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupolas</a>, and is an imposing sight. The <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Radegunde, which has a Roman <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> (eleventh century) and a Gothic <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> (twelfth century), rises on the site of a church founded in the sixth century in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the virgin queen St. Radegunde, who retired to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Ste. Croix. In the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> is her <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, and facing it a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, an "ex voto" of Anne of Austria in 1658, for the cure of her son <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>. The church of Notre Dame la Grande has a twelfth-century <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a>, which, to a height of fifty-six and a breadth of forty-eight feet, is completely covered with Romanesque carvings at one time polychrome. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, St. Peter's, is a beautiful Gothic building begun in the second half of the twelfth century under the reign of Henry II Plantagenet of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and Eleanor of Aquitaine and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 18 October, 1379. The Hotel de Ville of Poitiers contains some frescoes, masterpieces of <a href="../cathen/12584d.htm">Puvis de Chavannes</a>. they represent the victorious arrival of <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a> at Poitiers, and <a href="../cathen/06149a.htm">Fortunatus</a> reading his poems to St. Radegunde. Among councils held at Poitiers are those of: 590, in which the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> princess and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, Chrodielda, was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for revolt against her <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>; 1074, which dealt with the matrimonial affairs of William, Count of Poitiers, and to which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Poitiers, Isambert, came with a troop of soldiers and dispersed the members; 1075, which dealt with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a>, and at which Giraud was <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>; 1078, in which the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> Hugues passed <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>; 1100, in which Bishop Norgaud of <a href="../cathen/02144a.htm">Autun</a> was deposed for <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, Philip I of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and his <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubine</a> Bertrade were <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> narrowly escaped being stoned by the order of the Count of Poitiers, who was displeased with their decision; 1106, at which a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> was proclaimed. The Synod of 1868, assembled to celebrate the fifteenth centenary of St. Hilary's death, was attended by representatives from every part of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>. Five councils were held at Charroux in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; that of 1027 legislated against the spread of <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a>, and was concerned with the "Pax Dei", or <a href="../cathen/15068a.htm">Truce of God</a>.

<p>Poitiers is rich in historical souvenirs. The neighbourhood of Poitiers was the scene of two famous battles, that of October, 732, in which <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a> defeated Abd-el-Raman and definitively saved <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> from <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> invasion, and that of September, 1356, in which the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, John II, the Good, was made <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> by the English. In the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Cordeliers at Poitiers dwelt for sixteen months (June, 1307-8) <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Pope Clement V</a>, while <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip IV, the Fair</a>, of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> dwelt with the Jacobins. Jacques Molay and seventy-two <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> were questioned by <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> at Poitiers. In 1428 when the English held the country north of the Loire, Poitiers was more or less the headquarters of Charles VII, and thither in March, 1429, went <a href="../cathen/08409c.htm">Blessed Jeanne d'Arc</a> to see Charles VII and to be questioned concerning her mission. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the Calvarians was founded in 1617 by Antoinette d'Orl&eacute;ans, under the inspiration of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> Francis Le Clerc du Tremblay. "Poitiers, a town full of priests and monks", wrote La Fontaine in 1633, during a journey through Poitou. The portion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> which lies in the Department of Deux-S&egrave;vres was greatly disturbed during the sixteenth century by the Wars of Religion and under the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> by the Wars of La Vend&eacute;e. Among natives of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> are: <a href="../cathen/02241b.htm">Cardinal Jean Balue</a>. the Sainte-Marthes (see <a href="../cathen/06350c.htm">GALLIA CHRISTIANA</a>); Filleau de la Bouchetterie (1600-82), who, in 1654, accused <a href="../cathen/05218a.htm">Saint-Cyran</a>, <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>, and four other <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, with having at a meeting in 1621, discussed the means of substituting <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deism</a> for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>; <a href="../cathen/09548b.htm">Mme de Maintenon</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, Isaac Beausobre (1659-1738), the historian of <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a>.
