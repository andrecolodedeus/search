<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pomerania</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> province on the Baltic Sea situated on both banks of the River Oder, divided into Hither Pomerania (<em>Vorpommern</em>), the western part of the province, and Farther Pomerania (<em>Hinterpommern</em>), the eastern part. Its area is 11,628 square miles, and it contains 1,684,345 inhabitants. In the south-east Pomerania is traversed by a range of low hills (highest point fourteen miles), otherwise it is a low plain. Farming and market-gardening take 55.2 per cent of the soil, grass-land 10.2 per cent, pasturage 6.5 per cent, and woodland 20.2 per cent. The chief occupations are farming, cattle-raising, the shipping trade, and fishing. There is no manufacturing of any importance except in and near Stettin. The earliest inhabitants were German tribes, among them <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, Scirri, Rugians, Lemovier, <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundians</a>, Semnonians (Tacitus, "Germania"). About the middle of the second century these tribes began to migrate towards the south-east; they were replaced by others who also soon left, and <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> (Wends), entering from the east, gradually gained possession of the province. Consequently the name <em>Pommern</em> is Slavonic, <em>Po more, Po moran</em> signifying "along the sea". <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> compelled the acknowledgment of his suzerainty as far as the Oder, but his successors limited themselves to the defensive. In the reigns of Henry I and Otto the Great, the Wends were again <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to pay tribute. However, German supremacy remained uncertain and the <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> influence was greater, until the Poles conquered Pomerania about 995. As suffragan of their new Archdiocese of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>, established in 1000, the Poles founded the Diocese of Kolberg, which, however, existed apparently only in the parchment deed. It is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Reinbern ever stayed at Kolberg; he died about 1015 while on an embassy to Kiev.

<p>In the following era there were <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with varying results between the Poles, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danes</a>, and Germans for the possession of Pomerania. Finally after a long and bloody struggle the Poles were victorious (1122), and Duke Boleslaw earnestly endeavoured to convert the inhabitants to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The task was given to Bishop Otto of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> who accomplished it during two missionary journeys. At this period appears the name of the first well known Duke of Pomerania, Wratislaw. Otto had the supervision of the Pomeranian Church until his death, but could not found a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> to which to appoint the <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> Adalbert. After Otto's death, <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 14 Oct., 1140, made the church of <a href="../cathen/01127c.htm">St. Adalbert</a> at Julin on the Island of Wollin the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and Adalbert was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The difficulty as to which archdiocese was to be the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> was evaded by placing it directly under the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">papal see</a>. Duke Ratibor of Pomerania founded the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>: in 1153 a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Stolp, and later a <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Grobe on the island of Usedom. Before 1176 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was transferred to Kammin, where a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter was founded for the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of St. John. The western part of the country belonged to the Diocese of Schwerin. The founding of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at Dargun (1172) and at Kolbatz east of the Oder (1173) were events of much importance. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> greatly promoted the development of religion and civilization by engaging in agricultural undertakings of all kinds. About 1179 the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a> obtained a new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Gramzow near Prenzlau, and in 1180 at Belbuk in Farther Pomerania. In 1181 Duke Bogislaw received his lands in fief from <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Emperor Frederick I</a>, and thus became a prince of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>. This was followed by a large immigration of Germans.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization also progressed. <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were established at: Eldena (c. 1207); Neuenkamp (c. 1231); of the latter a branch on the Island of Hiddensee (1296); Bukow (c. 1253); Bergen on the island of R&uuml;gen (1193); near Stettin (1243); at Marienfliess (1248); near Kolberg (1277); near K&ouml;slin (1277); at Wollin (1288). A <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> was founded near Treptow on the Rega (1224). The Augustinians had <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at: Uckerm&uuml;nde (1260), later transferred to Jasenitz; Pyritz (c. 1255); Anklam (1304); Stargard (1306); Gartz (1308). The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> had foundations at: Stettin (1240); Greifswald (1242); Prenzlau (before 1253); Stralsund (1254); Pyritz (before 1286); Greifenberg (before 1290); Dramburg (after 1350); the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> at: Kammin (about 1228); Stralsund (1251); Greifswald (1254); Stolp (1278); Pasewalk (1272); Prenzlau (1275); Soldin (about 1289); N&ouml;renberg (fourteenth century). Finally the Duchess Adelheid founded the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Marienkron near K&ouml;slin in 1394; it was first transferred to Schlawe, then in 1407 to R&uuml;genwalde; in 1421 the Brigitine <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Marienkron was established at Stralsund. All these establishments contributed greatly to the extension of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and German civilization, as did also the orders of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, e.g., the Knights of St. John. Foundations for canons were made about 1200 at Kolberg. and in 1261 at Stettin.

<p>In 1295 Dukes Otto and Bogislaw divided the country into the two Duchies of Stettin and Wolgast; at later dates there were further divisions. The victory of German civilization in Pomerania was assured in the fourteenth century, and the diocese became dependent upon the dukes. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was merely the first in the social order of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>; and there were constant quarrels over the possession of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and of the episcopal castles. In the fifteenth century conditions were in great disorder. During the years 1437-43 the <a href="../cathen/13205b.htm">University of Rostock</a>, founded in 1419, withdrew from Rostock on account of quarrels between the council and the citizens, and settled at <a href="../cathen/07025a.htm">Greifswald</a>. The mayor, Heinrich Rubenow, urged Duke Wratislaw IX to establish a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> at <a href="../cathen/07025a.htm">Greifswald</a>, to which the duke agreed, gave some of his revenues for its support, and, aided by the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in Hither Pomerania, obtained from <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Callistus III</a> a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of foundation, 29 May, 1456. In the first semester 173 students matriculated. At the same time a foundation for twenty canons, intended to furnish maintenance for new teachers, was united with the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Nicholas. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> continued with increasing prosperity.

<p>About 1400 <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, caused by the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldensians</a>, developed in the province; Peter the Celestine came to Stettin to investigate the matter, and scattered the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in 1393. The <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the "Putzkeller", concerning which there are only confused reports, appears also to be traceable to the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldensians</a>. Diocesan <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were held in 1433, 1448 (at Stettin), 1454 (at G&uuml;lzow and Kammin), 1492, and 1500. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> show a disorderly condition of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, but earnest attempts to improve conditions. The first traces of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> appeared at Stralsund, and in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Belbuk, where Johannes Bugenhagen (Pomeranus), <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the town-school and teacher of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, became acquainted with <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> writing "De captivitate Babylonica"; he won over many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to the new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and in 1521 went to <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>. Preachers from other regions, and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who had left their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, found ready attention throughout the country, on account of the great social and <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> discontent, and especially the freedom from taxes of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>. In 1525 Stralsund adopted <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>, while Greifswald and Stargard remained true to the Faith, and other towns were divided between passionately contending parties. When Duke Barnim XI of Stettin, who had been a student at <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, and his nephew, Philip of Wolgast, joined the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> party, its victory was assured.

<p>A basis for the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran Church</a> of Pomerania was prepared by the Diet at Treptow on the Rega in 1534 with the aid of the rules drawn up by Bugenhagen. The <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and some of the nobility protested and left the diet; the towns gradually abandoned their opposition and accepted Bugenhagen's propositions, and Bishop <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> Manteuffel, who maintained his protest, died in 1544. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were suppressed (1535-6) and in 1539 the nobility gave up; the dukes joined the Smalkaldic League but maintained an ambiguous position. The later church ordinance of 1563 established the strictest form of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>, and the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was Bartholom&auml;us Suawe (1546). In 1548 <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a> claimed the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, as it belonged to the estates of the empire. The dukes were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to accept the Interim, and after Suawe resigned, Martin Weiher became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in 1549, was recognized by <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a>, 5 Oct., 1551, and took his place as a prince of the empire. In 1555 the Peace of Augsburg gave the final victory to the evangelical party in Pomerania. After Weiher's death in 1556 the diocese came under the control of the ruling princes, who filled the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> with members of their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. The Evangelical <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter with thirteen positions for worthy officials of the province and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> continued to exist until 1810. The last duke, Bogislaw XIV, who from 1625 had ruled over the united Duchies of Stettin and Wolgast, died childless 10 March, 1637; the country then passed to <a href="../cathen/02738c.htm">Brandenburg</a>, which by old treaties had the right of succession, but by the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> (1648) had to be content with Farther Pomerania; Hither Pomerania and R&uuml;gen were given to Sweden. The <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Duke Ernest Bogislaw of Croy, gave the Diocese of Kammin to Brandenburg in 1650. By the Treaty of Stockholm of 1720, Hither Pomerania as far as the Peene was given to Brandenburg-Prussia; the rest of the province and the island of R&uuml;gen were obtained by <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> in the treaty of 4 June, 1815.

<p>In 1824 the seven hundredth anniversary of Pomerania's conversion to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was celebrated, and a monument was erected to Bishop Otto of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> at Pyritz. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> have developed since the end of the eighteenth century from the military chaplaincies in the larger garrison towns. At the beginning these <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> were under the care of the Vicariate of the North German Missions. In 1821 they were placed under the Prince <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, who gave their administration to the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of St. Hedwig's at <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a> as episcopal delegate. At present (1911) there are two arch-presbyteries, K&ouml;slin and Stettin-Stralsund. K&ouml;slin has nine <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>: Arnswalde, Gr&uuml;nhof, K&ouml;slin, Kolberg, Neustettin, Pollnow, Schivelbein, Stargard, Stolp. Stettin-Stralsund has eleven: Anklam, <a href="../cathen/16009b.htm">Bergen</a>, Demmin, Greifswald, Hoppenwalde, Louisental, Pasewalk, Stettin, Stralsund, Swinem&uuml;nde, Viereck. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders are represented only by the <a href="../cathen/10201a.htm">Sisters of St. Charles Borromeo</a> at Gr&uuml;nhof, Misdroy, Stettin, and Stralsund. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the government district of Lauenburg-B&uuml;tow, that formerly belonged to the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, form five <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the Diocese of Kulm; the provostship of Tempelburg in the government district of K&ouml;slin belongs to the Archdiocese of Posen. At the last census (1905) the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Pomerania numbered 50,206. The largest <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> are Stettin (8635 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>), Lauenburg (1475), Stargard (1387), Kolberg (1054), Greifswald (951), and Stolp (951).
