<h1>Pontifical Colleges</h1>  

<p>In earlier times there existed in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> outside of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a large number of colleges, <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, and houses of the regular orders which, in one form or other, were placed under the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> or under the Sacred Congregation <em>de propaganda fide</em>. Of these only a few remain. A list of these institutions is given, with emphasis on the fact that their object was to maintain the Faith in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. The English College of <a href="../cathen/13329a.htm">St. Albans</a> at Valladolid (1589); the English College, <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> (1622); the Scotch College, Valladolid (1627); the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a>, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1592); the English colleges at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> (1568-1794), Madrid-Seville (1592-1767), San Lucar (1517), <a href="../cathen/13365c.htm">Saint-Omer</a> (1594-1795), Esquerchin (1750-93), Paris, (1611); the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> institutions at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> (1605-1791), Saint-Malo (1611-61), <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> (1615-1793), Lambsprug (1643-1791); the house of the Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> at Tongres (1770-93); the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> at Nieuport (1559 at <a href="../cathen/03005a.htm">Bruges</a>, 1626-1783 at Nieuport); the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> at Bornheim (1658-1794) and at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> (1680-1794); the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Recollets at <a href="../cathen/05138a.htm">Douai</a> (1614-1790); the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> houses at <a href="../cathen/13365c.htm">Saint-Omer</a> (1583-1773), Watten (1570, or perhaps 1600, to 1773), Li&#232;ge (1616-1773), Ghent (1622-1773). Two of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> institutions, <a href="../cathen/13365c.htm">Saint-Omer</a> and Li&#232;ge, existed as secular colleges up to 1793. Most of the other monastic foundations <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrated</a> later to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where several still exist.

<p>At the present time the matter is essentially different. In speaking of <em>pontifical</em> colleges the distinction must be made between those which have explicitly received the honorary title <em>Pontifical</em> and those which can be included in such only in a general sense, because they are directly dependent upon a central authority at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It is a matter of indifference whether the institutions are called <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> or colleges, as no material difference exists. There are only three institutions with the title <em>pontifical</em>: (1) The Pontifical Seminary of <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a>, Ceylon; (2) The Pontifical Seminary of <a href="../cathen/13648a.htm">Scutari</a> (Collegium Albaniense); (3) The Pontifical College Josephinum, at <a href="../cathen/04149a.htm">Columbus, Ohio</a>, U.S.A. The remaining sixteen colleges at present under consideration do not possess this designation, which is a merely honorary title. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are trained for the regular <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a> at the American colleges at <a href="../cathen/04149a.htm">Columbus (Ohio)</a> and <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>; the English, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, and Scotch institutions at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, <a href="../cathen/15258a.htm">Valladolid</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>; and the college at <a href="../cathen/13648a.htm">Scutari</a>; the remaining eleven institutions are employed in training missionaries. There are in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the Leonine Seminary of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>; the Albanian College of <a href="../cathen/13648a.htm">Scutari</a>; the English colleges at Valladolid and <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>; the Scotch College, Valladolid; the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a>, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; the Seminary for Foreign Missions, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>; All Hallows College, Dublin; St. Joseph's Seminary, Mill Hill, London; St. Joseph's Rezendaal, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>; the American College at <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>; St. Joseph's at <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a>, in the Tyrol; the missionary institute at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>; the Seminary for Foreign Missions at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>; and the Brignole-Sale College at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. In America there is the Josephinum College at <a href="../cathen/04149a.htm">Columbus, Ohio</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a>, <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>, and the General College at Pulo-Pinang. Formerly all these institutions were under the supreme direction of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> even when, by an agreement or by the terms of foundation, the appointment of the rectors of some institutions belonged to some other authority. Since the publication of the Constitution "Sapienti consilio" (29 June, 1908), which considerably limited the powers of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, it still has under its charge, according to the letter of the under-secretary of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> of 11 January, 1911, <em>ipso jure</em> the institutions at <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a>, <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a>, <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, and Pulo-Pinang; later decisions of the Consistorial Congregation have added to these the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for foreign missions at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, as well as the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. All other houses, <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, and colleges are, therefore, placed under the regular <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> either of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the country, or of a committee of these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or of the diplomatic representative of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in the respective country, when the cardinal secretary of state has not reserved to himself the immediate supervision of certain institutions. Some of the institutions mentioned no longer belong, strictly speaking, in the present category; but it seems advisable not to exclude them, because the transfer is of recent date and they are generally regarded as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> institutions in a broader sense. Their former dependence upon the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> is best shown by the detailed mention of them in the last handbook of this congregation, "Missiones Catholic&aelig; cura S. Congregationis de Propaganda Fide descript&aelig; anno 1907" (Rome, 1907), pp. 831-49. This is also explicitly stated in the letter referred to above. Ten of these institutions are in charge of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. The general <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Pulo-Pinang is under the care of a congregation of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> located at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> Society for Foreign Missions. The <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Congregation of the Mission</a> (<a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarists</a>) conduct the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, All Hallows at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and the Brignole-Sale College at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>; the Society of St. Joseph has charge of the institutions at Mill Hill, Rozendaal, and Brixen; the Pontifical Seminary of <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a> and the Pontifical College of <a href="../cathen/13648a.htm">Scutari</a> were transferred to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>; the Veronese Institute is under the care of the Sons of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, for African Missions.



<p>Pontifical College Josephinum at <a href="../cathen/04149a.htm">Columbus, Ohio</a>, founded at Pommery (1875) by Joseph Jessing as an <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, was transferred to <a href="../cathen/04149a.htm">Columbus</a> in 1877. In 1888 a high-school, in which the sons of poor <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of German descent could be prepared for <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies, was added. The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> faculty was established the following year, and later the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty. In 1892 Jessing transferred his college to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and it became a pontifical institution on 12 December, 1892. The college has developed rapidly and its financial basis is substantial and steadily increasing. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> there are under <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to engage in <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The entire training of the students is at the expense of the institution and is bilingual, German and English. The number of scholarships is now one hundred and eighteen, but it is not complete. By a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Congregation of the Consistory (29 July, 1909), the institution was to remain under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> only for matters relating to <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, etc. otherwise being dependent upon the Congregation of the Consistory. By a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the same congregation, 18 June, 1910, all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in future in the Josephinum are to be assigned to the various <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic Delegate</a> in Washington, D. C. For the American College of the Immaculate Conception, see <a href="../cathen/01424a.htm">THE AMERICAN COLLEGE AT LOUVAIN</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> see IRISH COLLEGES ON THE CONTINENT. The English College at Valladolid (St. Albans) was founded through the co-operation of the celebrated <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/11729a.htm">Robert Persons</a> with Philip II. Its purpose was to aid in saving the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> confirmed the foundation by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 25 April, 1592. In 1767 the English colleges at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> and Seville were united with this institution. The English College at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> was established by a Portuguese nobleman Pedro do Continho before 1622 and was confirmed on 22 September, 1622, by <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>, and on 14 October, 1627, by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>. The Scotch College at Valladolid was first established in 1627 at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, where the Scotch founder, William Semple, and his Spanish wife Maria de Ledesma lived. In 1767 the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the college fell to the <a href="../cathen/08158a.htm">Irish College</a> at Alcales de Henares, but in 1771 was restored to the Scotch College, which got a new lease of life by its transfer to Valladolid.

<p>For the College of All Hallows at <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, see <a href="../cathen/01314b.htm">ALL HALLOWS COLLEGE</a>. St. Joseph's Seminary at Mill Hill, London, founded by <a href="../cathen/15311b.htm">Cardinal Vaughan</a> in 1886, belongs to the Society of St. Joseph; it prepares missionaries for the foreign field. Connected with it are the two institutions at Rozendaal in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and at <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a> in the Tyrol. The Papal Seminary at <a href="../cathen/08596b.htm">Kandy</a>, <a href="../cathen/03547c.htm">Ceylon</a>, a general <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for training native Indian <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, was founded and endowed by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in 1893, and is under the immediate supervision of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">delegate Apostolic</a> for Eastern <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. The Papal Albanian College at <a href="../cathen/13648a.htm">Scutari</a> was founded in 1858 with money given by the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> Government, which had inherited from the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> Republic the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of protecting the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/01253b.htm">Albania</a>. Soon after its erection it was destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. The new building (ready for use in 1862) serves also for training Servian and Macedonian candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> Government has endowed twenty-four scholarships and the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> ten. The Leonine Seminary of <a href="../cathen/02046a.htm">Athens</a> was founded by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> on 20 November, 1901, to train Greeks for the Latin <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. The Seminary at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> for Foreign Missions was founded in 1850. The Seminary at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> for African Missions, founded in 1856, is connected with four Apostolic <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; it has laboured with great success in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. The Brignole-Sale College, founded in 1855 by the Marquis Antonin Brignole-Sale and his wife Arthemisia, was confirmed by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>. It has eight free scholarships for students from the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Liguria, and is conducted by the <a href="../cathen/10357a.htm">Lazarist</a> Fathers for the training of missionaries. The Seminary of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, founded in 1663, for training men for the foreign mission field, is carried on by an organization of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>. It is the largest institution of this kind, and at the present time (1911) nearly 1500 of its graduates are missionaries. The General College at Pulo-Pinang for training a native <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> for Eastern <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> was founded by the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The Veronese Institute at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> founded in 1867 for missions among the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> is at present, after many misfortunes and disappointments, in a fairly flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. For the sake of completeness there might be added to this list the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of the Fathers of the Immaculate Heart of Mary at Scheut near <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, the Maison-Carr&eacute;e of the <a href="../cathen/15613d.htm">White Fathers</a>, in <a href="../cathen/01311a.htm">Algiers</a>, and the institutions of the Missionaries of Steyl at Steyl, Heiligkreuz, St. Wendel, St. Gabriel (and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>). These, however, are to be regarded rather as monastic novitiates than as <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> established in earlier times at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>, and other places for the <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a> peoples have either disappeared or the foundations have been diverted to other purposes.
