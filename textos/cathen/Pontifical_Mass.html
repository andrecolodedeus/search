<h1>Pontifical Mass</h1>  

<p>Pontifical Mass is the solemn Mass celebrated by a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> with the ceremonies prescribed in the <a href="../cathen/03133a.htm">"C&aelig;remoniale Episcoporum"</a>, I and II. The full ceremonial is carried out when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> celebrates the Mass at the throne in his own <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a>, or with permission at the throne in another diocese. The "C remoniale" supposes that the canons are vested in the vestments of their order, the dignitaries, of whom the first acts as assistant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, in copes, those of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> order in <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasubles</a>, those of the diaconal order, of whom the first two act as assistant <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, in <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatics</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> in tunics over the <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplice</a> or the <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a>. In addition a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> in their regular vestments and a master of ceremonies assist the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Nine <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> minister the book, bugia, <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>, <a href="../cathen/03519c.htm">censer</a>, two <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolyte</a> candles, gremiale, and <a href="../cathen/04543a.htm">cruets</a>, and four minister in turn at the washing of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hands. Mention is also made of a train-bearer and of at least four and at most eight torch-bearers at the time of the <a href="../cathen/05380b.htm">Elevation</a>. All these <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> should wear <a href="../cathen/14343d.htm">surplices</a> except the four who attend to the washing of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> hands; the first four may also wear copes. The ornaments worn or used by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, besides those ordinarily required for Mass, are the <a href="../cathen/03087b.htm">buskins</a> and sandals, <a href="../cathen/11601a.htm">pectoral cross</a>, tunic, <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>, gloves, <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> (if he has a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to use it), <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, ring, <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>, gremiale, <a href="../cathen/02334a.htm">basin</a> and ewer, canon, and bugia. A seventh candle is also placed on the altar besides the usual six.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> vested in the <em>cappa magna</em> enters the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, visits the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, and then goes to the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, called the <em>secretarium</em>, where he assists at terce. During the singing of the psalms he reads the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of preparation for Mass and puts on the vestments for Mass as far as the <a href="../cathen/14301a.htm">stole</a>, then vested in the cope he sings the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of terce, after which the cope is removed, and he puts on the rest of the vestments. The procession headed by the censer-bearer, cross-bearer, and <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> then goes to the main altar. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> recites the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> at the foot of the altar, puts on the <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a>, and after <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissing</a> the altar and the book of gospels and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incensing</a> the altar, goes to the throne, where he officiates until the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a>. His gloves are then removed; having washed his hands, he goes to the altar, and continues the Mass. The ceremonies are practically the same as for a solemn Mass; however, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> sings Pax vobis instead of Dominus vobiscum after the Gloria; he reads the Epistle, Gradual, and Gospel seated on the throne; gives the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a> to each of his five chief <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>; washes his hands after the ablutions; sings a special formula of the episcopal blessing, making three signs of the cross in giving it, and begins the last Gospel of St. John at the altar and finishes it while returning to the throne or to the vesting-place. In pontifical Requiem Mass the <a href="../cathen/03087b.htm">buskins</a> and sandals, gloves, <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>, and seventh candle are not used. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> does not read the preparation for Mass and vest during terce and he puts on the <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a> before Mass begins.

<p>A <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> usually officiates at the faldstool. He has no assistant <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> being performed by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, and master of ceremonies; there is no seventh <a href="../cathen/01347a.htm">candle on the altar</a>, and ordinarily the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> is not used; he vests in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> or at the faldstool; he recites the entire Gospel of St. John at the altar. The same parts of the Mass are said at the faldstool as at the throne. Sometimes the ordinary celebrates <a href="../cathen/12232a.htm">pontifical Mass</a> at the faldstool, without assistant <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>. Solemn Mass celebrated with some of the pontifical ornaments and ceremonies by <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> and prothonotaries is also called pontifical. That of <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> is similar to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> Mass celebrated at the throne. Certain points of difference are explained in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Sacred Congregation of Rites of 27 September, 1659. The privileges and limitations in the use of the pontifical insignia by the different classes of prothonotaries are set forth in the Constitution of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, "Inter multiplices curas" (21 February, 1905).

<p>The solemn <a href="../cathen/12232a.htm">pontifical Mass</a> celebrated by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in St. Peter's has some peculiar ceremonies. In the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Mass a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishop</a> acts as assistant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal-deacons</a> are assistant <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the Mass, an auditor of the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a> is <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, there is a Greek <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, and the other offices are filled by the assistants to the pontifical throne, the members of the prelatical colleges, etc. The procession of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and those who compose the <em>capella pontificia</em> vested according to their rank and in the prescribed order precedes the Holy Father into St. Peter's. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, wearing the falda, <a href="../cathen/01428c.htm">amice</a>, <a href="../cathen/01251b.htm">alb</a>, <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a>, <a href="../cathen/11601a.htm">pectoral cross</a>, stola, cope (mantum), and <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a> is carried into the basilica on the <em>sedia gestatoria</em> under the canopy and with the two <em>flabella</em> borne on either side. Seven <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> accompany the cross-bearer. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is received at the door by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a> and the chapter, visits the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, and goes to the small throne for terce, where he receives the obedience of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>. While the psalms are being chanted, he reads the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the preparation for Mass, during which his <a href="../cathen/03087b.htm">buskins</a> and sandals are put on, and then he sings the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of terce. After that vestments are removed as far as the <a href="../cathen/03776a.htm">cincture</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> washes his hands, and puts on the subcinctorium, <a href="../cathen/11601a.htm">pectoral cross</a>, <a href="../cathen/05785b.htm">fanon</a>, stole, tunic, <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>, gloves, <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a>, <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, and ring. He does not use the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> or the bugia. He then gives the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a> to the last three of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priests</a>.

<p>The Epistle is sung first in Latin by the Apostolic <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> and then in Greek by the Greek <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, and likewise the Gospel first in Latin by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal-deacon</a> and then in Greek by the Greek <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. While elevating the Host and the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> turns in a half circle towards the Epistle and Gospel sides. After he has given the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a> to the assistant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and assistant <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, he goes to the throne, and there standing receives Communion. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> elevates the <a href="../cathen/11541b.htm">paten</a> containing the Host covered with the asterisk, and places it in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, which are covered with the <em>linteum pectorale</em>, so that the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> can bring it to the throne, then the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> elevates the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and brings it to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at the throne. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> consumes the smaller part of the Host, and communicates from the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> through a little tube called the fistula. He then divides the other part of the Host, gives communion to the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, and gives them the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a>, after which he receives the wine of the purification from another <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and purifies his fingers in a little cup. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, having returned to the altar, partake of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> through the fistula, the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> consumes the particle of the Host in the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>, and both the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> consume the wine and the water used in the purification of the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> returns to the altar to finish the Mass. After the blessing the assistant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> publishes the plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>. At the end of the last Gospel the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> goes to the <em>sedia gestatoria</em>, puts on the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a>, and returns in procession as he had entered.
