<h1>Pontificalia</h1>  

<p>(PONTIFICALS).

<p>The collective name given for convenience sake to those insignia of the episcopal order which of right are worn by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> alone. In its broader sense the term may be taken to include all the items of attire proper to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, even those belonging to their civil or choir dress, for example the <em>cappa magna</em>, or the hat with its green cord and lining. But more strictly and accurately, rubricians limit the pontificals to those ornaments which a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> wears in celebrating pontifically. The pontificals common to all are enumerated by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> in his constitution "Decet Romanos" (4 July, 1823), and are eight in number: <a href="../cathen/03087b.htm">buskins</a>, sandals, gloves, <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>, tunicle, ring, <a href="../cathen/11601a.htm">pectoral cross</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>. When <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, prothonotaries apostolic, and in some cases canons, receive by <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the privilege of celebrating <em>cum pontificalibus</em>, these eight ornaments are meant. The use of them is ordinarily restricted--for Abbots to their own <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> or places within their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, for canons to their own church, and for prothonotaries to those places for which the ordinary gives his consent. Moreover, while <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> may wear most of these things in all solemn <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions, those who enjoy them by <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">papal indult</a> may only exercise this privilege in the celebration of Mass. Several other restrictions distinguish the pontifical Mass of such inferior <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> from that of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. The former are not allowed to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> the people as they pass through the church; they have no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to a seventh <a href="../cathen/01347a.htm">candle on the altar</a>; they vest in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> and not in the sanctuary; they do not use faldstool, or <em>bugia</em>, or <em>gremiale</em>, or <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a>, or Canon, and they are attended by no assistant <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; they do not say "Pax vobis", and they only wash their hands once, i.e. at the offertory. The legislation upon this subject is to be found in the above-mentioned constitution of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, supplemented by the "Apostolic Sedis officium" of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> (26 Aug., 1872) and the Motu Proprio of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, "Inter multiplices" (21 Feb., 1905). With regard to the ornaments just mentioned and other such pontificals or quasi-pontificals as the manteletta, mozzetta, <em>rationale</em>, <a href="../cathen/13104a.htm">rochet</a>, etc. nearly all will be found separately treated in their alphabetical order. The <a href="../cathen/03087b.htm">buskins</a> (<em>calig&aelig;</em>) are large silk leg-coverings put on over the ordinary stockings and gaiters and tied with a ribbon. The <em>gremiale</em> is simply an apron of silk or linen which is spread over a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> lap when he is seated or using the <a href="../cathen/07421b.htm">holy oils</a>. The "Canon" is a <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical book</a> containing nothing but the Canon of the Mass, which is used instead of the <a href="../cathen/01351b.htm">altar cards</a> when a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> pontificates. The <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> cross may also be mentioned, but they form ordinarily the special insignia of an <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>.

<p>The practice of conceding the use of certain of the pontificals to <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of inferior rank is one of ancient date. A grant of <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a> and sandals to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a> is recorded in the year 970 (Jaff&eacute;, "Regesta" 374). In the eleventh century <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Pope Leo IX</a> granted the use of the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> to the Canons of Besan on and of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> (Jaff&eacute;, 4249 and 4293). The earliest known concession of the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> to the ruler of a monastic house is that made to Abbot Egelsinus of St. Augustine's, <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, in 1063. At a somewhat later date the grants of pontifical insignia to monastic superiors and other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> are of constant occurrence in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> "Regesta". To obtain such distinctions became a point of rivalry among all the greater <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, the more so that such concessions were by no means always made in the same form or with the same amplitude, while subsequent <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a> often extended the terms of previous grants. Thus while, as noticed above, the concession of the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> to St. Augustine's, <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, in one of the earliest instances on record, the use of the tunicle and <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a> at High Mass was only granted to the same <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> by <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> in 1238 (Bliss, "Papal Registers", I, 170). In 1251 <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> conceded to the Prior of Coventry and his successor the use of the ring only. It might be worn at all times and in all places except in celebrating Mass (ibid., 268). To the Prior of <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, on the other hand, only three years later, the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, granted a much more ample concession in virtue of which he might use <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>, ring, tunic, <a href="../cathen/04608a.htm">dalmatic</a>, gloves, and sandals, might <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalices</a>, altar cloths, etc., might confer the first <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> as well as the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> of ostiarius and <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a>, and bestow the episcopal benediction at High Mass and at table (ibid., 395). It will be noticed that the <a href="../cathen/04515c.htm">crosier</a> is not here included. But it was included in a grant to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Selby by <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> in 1256 (ibid., 331). In many of these <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indults</a> a restriction was imposed that pontifical ornaments were not to be worn in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, but even here distinctions were made. For example <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a>, in 1365, allowed the Prior of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a> to wear the plain <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> and ring in presence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and in his absence to wear the precious <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> and ring and episcopal vestments, and to give his solemn benediction. (Bliss, IV, 48.) Not unfrequently it was specified that such pontificals might be worn in parliaments and councils "whenever any <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> below <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> wear their <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a>". One most extraordinary series of concessions, to which attention has recently been called in the English Historical Review (Jan., 1911, p. 124), where the documents are printed, first bestows upon the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Osyth the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to use the <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> and other pontificals (Bliss, V, 334), and then gives power to confer not only the <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdiaconate</a> but the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. This grant made by <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>, in 1397, during the great Schism, was cancelled by the same <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> six years afterwards at the request of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>.
