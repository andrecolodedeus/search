<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pontius Pilate</h1>  

<p>After the deposition of the eldest son of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#II">Archelaus</a> (who had succeeded his father as ethnarch), <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> was placed under the rule of a Roman procurator. Pilate, who was the fifth, succeeding Valerius Gratus in A.D. 26, had greater authority than most procurators under the empire, for in addition to the ordinary <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of financial administration, he had supreme power judicially. His unusually long period of office (A.D. 26-36) covers the whole of the active ministry both of <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.

<p>As <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> Pilate was necessarily of equestrian rank, but beyond that we know little of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> or origin. Some have thought that he was only a freedman, deriving his name from <em>pileus</em> (the cap of freed <a href="../cathen/14039a.htm">slaves</a>) but for this there seems to be no adequate evidence, and it is unlikely that a freedman would attain to a post of such importance. The Pontii were a Samnite <em>gens</em>. Pilate owed his appointment to the influence of Sejanus. The official residence of the procurators was the palace of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> at <a href="../cathen/03134b.htm">C&aelig;sarea</a>; where there was a military force of about 3,000 soldiers. These soldiers came up to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> at the time of the feasts, when the city was full of strangers, and there was greater danger of disturbances, hence it was that Pilate had come to <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> at the time of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Crucifixion</a>. His name will be forever covered with <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> because of the part which he took in this matter, though at the time it appeared to him of small importance.

<p>Pilate is a type of the worldly <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, knowing the right and anxious to do it so far as it can be done without personal <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of any kind, but yielding easily to pressure from those whose interest it is that he should <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> otherwise. He would gladly have acquitted <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and even made serious efforts in that direction, but gave way at once when his own position was threatened.

<p>The other events of his rule are not of very great importance. Philo (Ad Gaium, 38) speaks of him as inflexible, merciless, and obstinate. The <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> him and his administration, for he was not only very severe, but showed little consideration for their susceptibilities. Some standards bearing the image of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, which had been set up by him in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, caused an outbreak which would have ended in a massacre had not Pilate given way. At a later date <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> ordered him to remove certain gilt shields, which he had set up in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in spite of the remonstrances of the people. The incident mentioned in St. Luke 13:1, of the <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilaeans</a> whose blood Pilate mingled with the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, is not elsewhere referred to, but is quite in keeping with other <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authentic</a> events of his rule. He was, therefore, anxious that no further hostile reports should be sent to the emperor concerning him.

<p>The tendency, already discernible in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">canonical Gospels</a>, to lay stress on the efforts of Pilate to acquit <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and thus pass as lenient a judgment as possible upon his crime, goes further in the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and led in later years to the claim that he actually became a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> reckons him as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, and assigns 25 June to him and to Claudia Procula, his wife. The <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that she became a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> goes back to the second century, and may be found in <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Hom., in Mat., xxxv). The <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> assigns her a <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> on 27 October. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin Martyr</a> both speak of a report on the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Crucifixion</a> (not extant) sent in by Pilate to <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>, from which <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> a large amount of <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal literature</a> originated. Some of these were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> in origin (<a href="../cathen/01111b.htm">Gospel of Nicodemus</a>), others came from the <a href="../cathen/09121a.htm">heathen</a>, but these have all perished.

<p>His rule was brought to an end through trouble which arose in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>. An imposter had given out that it was in his power to discover the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> which, as he alleged, had been hidden by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> on Mount Gerizim, whither armed <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> came in large numbers. Pilate seems to have thought the whole affair was a blind, covering some other more important design, for he hurried forces to attack them, and many were slain. They appealed to Vitellius, who was at that time legate in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, saying that nothing political had been intended, and complaining of Pilate's whole administration. He was summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to answer their charges, but before he could reach the city the <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Emperor Tiberius</a> had died.

<p>That is the last we know of Pilate from <a href="../cathen/02137a.htm">authentic</a> sources, but <a href="../cathen/09121a.htm">legend</a> has been busy with his name. He is said by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250102.htm"><em>Church History</em> II.7</a>), on the authority of earlier writers, whom he does not name, to have fallen into great misfortunes under Caligula, and eventually to have committed <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a>. Other details come from less respectable sources. His body, says the "Mors Pilati", was thrown into the Tiber, but the waters were so disturbed by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> that the body was taken to Vienne and sunk in the Rh&ocirc;ne, where a monument, called Pilate's tomb, is still to be seen. As the same thing occurred there, it was again removed and sunk in the lake at <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Lausanne</a>. Its final disposition was in a deep and lonely mountain tarn, which, according to later tradition, was on a mountain, still called Pilatus, close to <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>. The real origin of this name is, however, to be sought in the cap of cloud which often covers the mountain, and serves as a barometer to the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>. The are many other <a href="../cathen/09121a.htm">legends</a> about Pilate in the <a href="../cathen/09121a.htm">folklore</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, but none of them have the slightest authority.
