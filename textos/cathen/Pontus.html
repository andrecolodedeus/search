<h1>Pontus</h1>  

<p>In ancient times, <em>Pontus</em> was the name of the north-eastern province of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, a long and narrow strip of land on the southern coast of the Black Sea (<em>Pontus Euxinus</em>), from which the designation was later transferred to the country. Before this the province was called Cappadocia on the Pontus. The country was shut in by high and wild mountain ranges, but was exceedingly fertile in the lower parts on the coast, in the interior, and on the plateaux. It yielded fruit of all kinds, especially cherries, which Lucullus is said to have brought into <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> from Pontus 72 <font size=-2>B. C.;</font> also wine, grain, wood, honey, wax, etc., besides iron, steel, and salt. It was inhabited by a number of petty tribes; among these were the Chalybes or Chald&aelig;ans, held in high repute by the Greeks as the first smiths. All belonged to the Persian empire, but in Xenophon's day (about 400 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>) were to a considerable degree independent of the <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persians</a>. At this date, however, these different countries had no common name. Greeks settled early on the coast, and founded flourishing commercial cities, as Trapezus (Trebizond), <a href="../cathen/03537d.htm">Cerasus</a>, Side, later called Polemonium, Cotyora, <a href="../cathen/01430b.htm">Amisus</a>, and Apsarus. The founder of the Kingdom of Pontus was Mithradates I, son of Prince Mithradates of <a href="../cathen/03794a.htm">Cius</a> on the Propontis, who was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> 302 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> Mithradates I, taking advantage of the confusion caused by the Diadochian Wars, came to Pontus with only six horsemen and was able to assume the title of king 296 <font size=-2>B. C.;</font> he died in 266 after a reign of thirty-six years. He was followed by Ariobarzanes (died about 258 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), Mithradates II (to about 210 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), Mithradates III (to about 190 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), Pharnaces (to 170 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), Mithradates IV (to about 150 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), Mithradates V (to 121 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>), and then Mithradates VI Eupator, or the Great. The kings, Persian by descent, formed relations early with Greece and from the beginning Hellenistic culture found an entrance into Pontus. The religion was a mixture of Greek worships with the old native cults. From the time of Pharnaces the kings were allied with the Romans. Mithradates VI became involved in three <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> with the Romans (88-84, 83-81, 74-64), and finally his kingdom, which he had increased by the conquest of Colchis, the Crimea, Paphlagonia, and Cappadocia, was lost to the Romans (63). The territory west of the River Halys, the coast of Paphlagonia, and the valley of the Amnias became a part of Roman territory and with Bithynia were united into the double Province of Bithynia and Pontus. The other parts were made into principalities and free cities, and it was not until 7 <font size=-2>B.C., A D.</font> 18, and <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 63 that they were gradually absorbed by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Under <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> (284-305) Pontus became a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of the empire. The Pontus mentioned in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> in <a href="../bible/gen014.htm#vrs1">Genesis 14:1-9</a> is a mistaken translation, according to Symmachus, for the district of Ellasar (Larsa in southern <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonia</a>).

<p>In Apostolic times <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> found an entrance into Pontus. The First Epistle of Peter is addressed to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in Pontus among others, showing that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had spread to some extent in this province. The author in his exhortations presupposes relations between the faithful and the non-Christian population. For the years 111-13 we have the important testimony of Pliny, then Governor of Bithynia and Pontus (Ep. xcvi). Pliny did not mention the cities or villages, and it is uncertain whether Amastris, or Amasia, or Comana, was the place where <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were tried by him. As concerns Amisus, Ramsay has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sources that it contained <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> about the year 100. Later Amastris was the chief <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> mentions (IV, xxiii) a letter written by Bishop <a href="../cathen/05010a.htm">Dionysius of Corinth</a> (about 170) to <a href="../cathen/01380d.htm">Amastris</a>, "and the other churches in Pontus". There was, therefore, at this era a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> with several churches. About 240 <a href="../cathen/07015a.htm">Gregory Thaumaturgus</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Neo-C&aelig;sarea by Ph&aelig;dimus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01380c.htm">Amasia</a>. It is said that at that time there were only seventeen <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the city and its vicinity, and that at his death, shortly before 270, only the same number of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> could be found in the city. The able <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> converted the people by opposing <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and by changing the old feasts into <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">Christian festivals</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> he made concessions to human weakness, advised the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to be less aggressive, and fled himself. Comana received a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from <a href="../cathen/07015a.htm">Gregory</a>. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> obtained a foothold also in the Greek cities of the coast of eastern Pontus before 325. In or about the year 315 a great synod was held at Neo-C&aelig;sarea by Bishop Longinus. At the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a> there were present among others the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/01380d.htm">Amastris</a>, Pompejopolis, Jonopolis, <a href="../cathen/01380c.htm">Amasia</a>, <a href="../cathen/04151b.htm">Comana</a>, <a href="../cathen/15753c.htm">Zela</a>, <a href="../cathen/15028a.htm">Trebizond</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12126a.htm">Pityus</a>. Towards the end of the fourth century Neo-C&aelig;sarea became itself a Church-province, having as suffragans Trebizond, <a href="../cathen/03537d.htm">Cerasus</a>, <a href="../cathen/12204a.htm">Polemonium</a>, <a href="../cathen/04151b.htm">Comana</a>, Rhiz&aelig;um, and <a href="../cathen/12126a.htm">Pityus</a>.
