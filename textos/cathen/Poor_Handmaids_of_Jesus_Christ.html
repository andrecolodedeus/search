<h1>Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ</h1>  

<p>A community founded by Catherine Kasper, a native of Dernbach, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. She was born 26 May, 1820, of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and at an early age resolved to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> her life to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. She was animated with the spirit of Mary and the activity of Martha and wished to combine the contemplative and active life in the service of her Master. She and two companions took <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and professed themselves Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ, on 15 August, 1851. Sister Mary (Catherine Kasper) was chosen mother-general of the newly founded community and continued as such until her death, 2 Feb., 1898, when the community had branches throughout <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and North America.

<p>Mother Mary Kasper had first simply desired that her community be devoted to the sick and needy and especially the <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan</a>; but it soon engaged in the work of teaching and began to conduct in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, academies, boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, kindergartens, and industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em>compelled the sisters to abandon their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, but they continued the other <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>. The constitution of the community was temporarily approved by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1870 and finally confirmed by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>.

<p>Through the Bishop Luers and Rev. Edward Koenig, <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. Paul's Church at <a href="../cathen/06150a.htm">Fort Wayne</a>, the community began to labour at <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a> Cassel in the <a href="../cathen/06150a.htm">Diocese of Fort Wayne</a> on 3 August, 1863. From this place three sisters were called to <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> in 1869 by the Very Rev. Peter Fischer, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar general</a>, to the charge of the German <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphan asylum</a>, which opened with twelve children, but now shelters more than six hundred <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. On 9 May, 1869, the Rockhill <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> at <a href="../cathen/06150a.htm">Fort Wayne</a> was purchased and converted into a <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a>. To this was added a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in 1883 at a cost of $32,000. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> is the provincial mother-house of the community in America.

<p>The first <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> conducted by the sisterhood in this country was St. Paul's in <a href="../cathen/06150a.htm">Fort Wayne</a>, of which they took charge on 6 October, 1869. Now the community is represented in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/06150a.htm">Fort Wayne</a>, <a href="../cathen/02414c.htm">Belleville</a>, <a href="../cathen/01367c.htm">Alton</a>, <a href="../cathen/14336a.htm">Superior</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">Archdioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/13366b.htm">St. Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, Philadelphia, and St. Louis. The sisters are engaged in teaching, and nursing the sick in <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and private homes. Of the 3,500 members which the community now numbers, 500 labour in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>.
