<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope Adrian IV</h1>  

<p>Born 1100 (?); died 1 September, 1159. Very little is known about the birthplace, parentage, or boyhood of Adrian. Yet, as is usual in such cases, very various, and sometimes very circumstantial, accounts have reached us about him.

<p>Our only reliable information we owe to two writers, <a href="../cathen/02697a.htm">Cardinal Boso</a> and <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a>. The former wrote a life of Adrian, which is included in the collection of Nicolas Roselli, made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> in 1356 during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/08018b.htm">Innocent VI</a>. <a href="../cathen/02697a.htm">Boso's</a> life, published by <a href="../cathen/10641b.htm">Muratori</a> (SS. Rer. Ital. III, I 441-446) and reprinted in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> (P.L., CLXXXVIII, 135-160), also edited by Watterich (Vitae Pontificum II, 323- 374), and now to be read in Duchesne's edition of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">Liber Pontificalis</a> (II, 388-397; cf. proleg XXXVII-XLV), states that <a href="../cathen/02697a.htm">Boso</a>, the author of it; was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal-deacon</a> of the title of Sts. Cosmas and Damian, was chamberlain to Adrian and in constant and familiar attendance upon him from the commencement of his apostolate. [Ciacconius says that <a href="../cathen/02697a.htm">Boso</a> was the nephew of Adrian, but Watterich observes (op. cit. prolegomena) that he finds no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this.]

<p>Boso tells us that Adrian was born in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in or near the burg of <a href="../cathen/13329a.htm">St. Albans</a>, and that he left his country and his relations in his boyhood to complete his studies, and went to Arles in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. During the vacation he visited the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Sts. Rufus near <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, where he took the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and habit of an <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Austin canon</a>. After some <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> he was elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and, going to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on important business connected with the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, was retained there by <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Pope Eugenius III</a>, and made a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a> (1146). <a href="../cathen/11499a.htm">Matthew Paris</a> agrees in some measure with this, for he tells us that on Adrian's applying to the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban's</a> to be received as a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, after examining him, found him deficient and said to him kindly: "Have patience, my son, and stay at <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> yet a while till you are better fitted for the position you desire." He states further that he was "a native of some hamlet under the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, perhaps Langley," and I may add that it is now tolerably <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he was born at Abbot's Langley in Hertfordshire, about the year 1100; that his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was Robert Brekespear, a man of humble means, though of a decent stock; and that Adrian went abroad as a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> wandering scholar, like <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a> and many others at that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. However, <a href="../cathen/15634c.htm">William of Newburgh</a>, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, an <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Austin canon</a> and a historian of high repute (1136-98?), gives a very different account, which he probably had from the neighbouring <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> houses of <a href="../cathen/13054b.htm">Rievaulx</a> and Byland. "Eugenius III", he tells us,<blockquote><p>was succeeded by Nicolas, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a>, who, changing his name with his fortune, called himself Adrian. Of this man it may be well to relate how he was raised as it were from the dust to sit in the midst of princes and to occupy the throne of <a href="../cathen/01648b.htm">apostolic</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. He was born in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was a clerk of slender means who, abandoning his youthful son, became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at <a href="../cathen/13329a.htm">St. Albans</a>. As the boy grew up, seeing that through want he could not afford the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to go to <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, he attended the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for a daily pittance. His father was ashamed of this, taunted him with bitter words for his idleness, and, highly indignant, drove him away disconsolate. The boy, left to himself, and compelled to do something by hard <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a>, ingenuously ashamed either to dig or beg, crossed over to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>He then states that after Adrian was elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Sts. Rufus the canons repented of their choice and came to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> him, and <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appealed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> on two occasions, bringing divers charges against him (II, vi). This narrative is not only contrary to <a href="../cathen/02697a.htm">Boso's</a> but to what Adrian himself told <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a>.

<blockquote><p>"The office of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, he assured me, was a thorny one, beset on all sides with sharp pricks. He wished indeed that he had never left <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, his native land, or at least had lived his life quietly in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> of Sts. Rufus rather than have entered on such difficult paths, but he dared not refuse, since it was the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord's</a> bidding" (Polycraticus, Bk. IV, xxviii).</p></blockquote>

<p>How could he have looked back with regret to quiet and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> days if he had encountered <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parental</a> cruelty at <a href="../cathen/13329a.htm">St. Albans</a> and <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> insubordination at Sts. Rufus?

<p>In 1152 Adrian was sent on a delicate and important mission to Scandinavia, as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, in which he acquitted himself to the satisfaction of everybody. He established an independent <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> for <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> at <a href="../cathen/15064a.htm">Trondhjem</a>, which he selected chiefly in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/11234a.htm">St. Olaf</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> reposed in its church. He reformed the abuses that had crept into the usages of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and even aided in bettering the civil institutions of the country. Snorro relates that no foreigner ever came to <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a> who gained so much public <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and deference among the people as Nicholas Brekespear. He was prevented for the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> from establishing an <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal see</a> in <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> by the rivalry between <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a> and Gothland, the one party claiming the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> for Upsala, the other for <a href="../cathen/16074b.htm">Skara</a>. But he reformed abuses there also, and established the contribution known as <a href="../cathen/11774a.htm">Peter's pence</a>.

<p>On his return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he was hailed as the Apostle of the North, and, the death of Anastasius IV occurring at that <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> (2 December, 1154), he was on the following day unanimously elected the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">successor of St. Peter</a>; but the office was not a bed of roses. King William of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> was in open hostility, and the professed friendship of <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick Barbarossa</a> was even more dangerous. The barons in the Campagna fought with each other and with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> and, issuing from their castles, raided the country in every direction, and even robbed the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> on their way to the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. The turbulent and fickle populace of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was in open revolt under the leadership of <a href="../cathen/01747b.htm">Arnold of Brescia</a>. Cardinal Gerardus was mortally wounded in broad daylight, as he was walking along the Via Sacra.

<p>Adrian, a determined <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, at once laid the city under an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> and retired to <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>. He forbade the observance of any sacred service until the Wednesday of <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>. "Then were the senators impelled by the voice of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> alike to prostrate themselves before His Holiness." Submission was made, and the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">ban</a> removed. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and Arnold escaped and was taken under the protection of some of the bandit barons of the northern Campagna. He was subsequently delivered up and executed. Meanwhile <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> was advancing through <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, and after receiving the Iron Crown at Pavia had approached the confines of the papal territory, intending to receive the imperial crown in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>.

<p>After some negotiations a famous meeting took place at Sutri, about 30 miles north of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, on the 9th of June, 1155, between Frederick of Hohenstauffen, then the most powerful ruler in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> canon of Sts. Rufus, now the most powerful spiritual ruler in the world. As the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> approached, the Emperor advanced to meet him, but did not hold the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope's</a> stirrup, which was part of the customary <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of homage. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> said nothing then, but dismounted, and the Emperor led him to a chair and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> his slipper. Custom required that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> should then give the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a>. He refused to do so, and told Frederick that until full homage had been paid he would withhold it. This implied that he would not crown him. Frederick had to submit, and on the 11th of June another meeting was arranged at Nepi, when Frederick advanced on foot and held the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope's</a> stirrup, and the incident was closed.

<p>Frederick was afterwards duly <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> at St. Peter's, and took the solemn <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> prescribed by ancient <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremonies</a> a guard of imperial troops had been placed on or near the bridge of St. Angelo to protect that suburb, then known as the Leonine City. The bridge was stormed by the republican troops from the city proper, and a fierce battle ensued between the imperial army and the Romans. Fighting lasted through the hot summer's day and far on into the evening. Finally the Romans were routed. Over 200 fell as <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> into Frederick's hands, including most of the leaders, and more than 1,000 were killed or drowned in the Tiber. The citizens, however, held the city and refused to give the Emperor provisions; the latter, now that he was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a>, made no serious effort either to help the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> against the Normans or to reduce the city to subjection. Malaria appeared among his troops. "He was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to turn", says Gregorovius, in his in <em>History of the City of Rome</em>, "and, not without some painful self-reproach, to abandon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> to his <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>." He took leave of him at <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>, and, marching north by way of <a href="../cathen/05785d.htm">Farfa</a>, reduced to ashes on his route the ancient and celebrated city of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>.

<p>William I succeeded his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> on the throne of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> in February, 1154. Adrian refused to recognize him as king, and addressed him merely as <em>Dominus</em> (Lord). Hostilities followed. The <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilians</a> laid siege to Beneventum without result, and afterwards ravaged the southern Campagna and retired. Adrian <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> William. After the departure of Frederick, Adrian collected his vassals and mercenaries and marched south to Beneventum, a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> possession, where he remained until June, 1156. It was during this time that <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a> spent three months with him, and obtained from him the famous Donation of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> (see page 158). The fortune of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> favoured William. He captured <a href="../cathen/02787e.htm">Brundusium</a>, with an immense store of provisions and munitions of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and five thousand pounds' weight of gold that the Greek Emperor, Manuel I, intended for his ally the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>. He also took captive many wealthy Greeks, whom he sent to <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a>, some for ransom, but the greater number to be sold into slavery. This practically determined the issue of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Peace was made in June, 1153, and a treaty concluded. The Pope agreed to invest William with the crowns of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and Apulia, the territories and states of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>, and all the other cities which the King then possessed. William on his part took the <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> and became the liegeman of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, and promised to pay a yearly tribute, and to defend the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> possessions (Watterich, op. cit., II, 352). After this, the Pope went to <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, where he came to an agreement with the Romans, and in the beginning of 1157 returned to the City. The Emperor deeply resented the act of the Pope in investing William with territories which he claimed as part of his dominions, and for this and other causes a conflict broke out between them. (See <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">ALEXANDER III</a>, FREDERICK I, <a href="../cathen/08084b.htm">INVESTITURES</a>.) Adrian died at <a href="../cathen/01448a.htm">Anagni</a>, in open strife with the Emperor, and in league with the Lombards against him. <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> carried out the intentions of Adrian, and shortly afterwards <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the Emperor.


<h2>The donation of Ireland</h2>

<p>It was during the Pope's stay at <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Beneventum</a> (1156), as we have stated, that <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a> visited him. "I recollect", he writes, "a journey I once made into Apulia for the purpose of visiting his Holiness, Pope Adrian IV. I stayed with him at <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Beneventum</a> for nearly three months" (Polycraticus, VI, 24; P.L. CXCIX, 623). In another work, the <em>Metalogicus</em>, this writer says:<blockquote><p>At my solicitation [<em>ad preces meas</em>] he gave and granted Hibernia to Henry II, the illustrious King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, to hold by hereditary right as his letter [which is extant] to this day testifies. For all islands of ancient right, according to the Donation of Constantine, are said to belong to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, which he founded. He sent also by me a ring of gold, with the best of emeralds set therein, wherewith the investiture might be made for his governorship of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and that same ring was ordered to be and is still in the public treasury of the King. </p></blockquote>

<p>It will be observed that he says, "at my solicitation", and not at the request of Henry, and that he went "for the purpose of visiting" (<em>caus&acirc; visitandi</em>), not on an official mission. The suggestion that because he was born in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> Adrian made <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> over to the Angevin monarch, who was no relation of his does not merit serious attention. The <em>Metalogicus</em> was written in the autumn of 1159 or early in 1160, and the passage quoted occurs in the last chapter (IV, xlii; P.L., vol. cit., col. 945). It is found in all <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the work, one of which was written possibly as early as 1175, and certainly before 1200. Nobody questions the truthfulness of <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a>, and the only objection raised to the statement is that it may be an interpolation. If it is not an interpolation, it constitutes a complete <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the Donation, the investiture by the ring being legally sufficient, and in fact the mode used in the case of the Isle of Man, as Boichorst points out. Adrian's Letter, however, creates a difficulty. His <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, usually called <em>Laudabiliter</em>, does not purport to confer Hibernia "by hereditary <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a>", but the letter referred to was not <em>Laudabiliter</em>, but a formal letter of investiture, such as was used in the case of <a href="../cathen/07072b.htm">Robert Guiscard</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, e.g. "I Gregory, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, invest you, Duke Robert, with the land of", etc. (<em>Ego Gregorius Papa investio te, Roberte Dux, de terra,</em> etc.; <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Coll. Conc., XX, 313). The question of the genuineness of the passage in the <em>Metalogicus</em>, impugned by <a href="../cathen/14366a.htm">Cardinal Moran</a>, W.B. Morris, and others, must be kept quite separate from the question of the genuineness of <em>Laudabiliter</em>, and it is mainly by mixing both together that the passage in the <em>Metalogicus</em> is assailed as a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>. Boichorst (Mittheilungen des Instituts f&uuml;r &ouml;sterreichische Geschichtsforschung IV, supplementary vol., 1893, p. 101) regards the Donation as indisputable, while rejecting <em>Laudabiliter</em> as a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>. Liebermann (Deutsche Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Geschichtswissenschaft 1892, I, 58) holds the same view. Thatcher, in <em>Studies Concerning Adrian IV; I. The Offer of Ireland to Henry II</em>, printed in the fourth volume of the Decennial Publications for the University of <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> (Series I, Chicago, 1903), reproduces the arguments of Boichorst. Bishop Creighton held <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a> to be unanswerable (Tarleton, p. 180). The overwhelming weight of authority is therefore in favour of the genuineness of the passage in <em>Metalogicus</em>. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <em>Laudabiliter</em> stands on a different footing. Opinions have hitherto been sharply divided as to its genuineness, as will be seen by a reference to the end of this article; but these opinions have been formed without a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the text of the <em>Laudabiliter</em> in the Book of Leinster, except in the case of Boichorst, who refers to it casually in a note which has been recently published for the first time by the writer (New Ireland Review March, 1906; cf. his History of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, xxvi, Dublin, 1906). To the text of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> are prefixed the following headings: "Ah! men of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the world, how beautiful [so far Gaelic] when over the cold sea in ships Zephyrus wafts glad tidings" [Latin] a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> granted to the King of the English on the collation, i.e. grant, of Hibernia, in which nothing is derogated from the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, as appears by the words of the text. This was almost certainly written, and probably by his old tutor Aedh McCrimthainn, during the lifetime of Diarmaid MacMurchada, who was banished in 1157, and died in 1171. The text of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was therefore no <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">medieval scholastic</a> exercise. Assuming the statements in the <em>Metalogicus</em> to be correct, the texts relating to the Donation of Adrian may be conjecturally arranged as follows: (1) The Letter of Investiture referred to by <a href="../cathen/08478b.htm">John of Salisbury</a>, 1156; (2) <em>Laudabiliter</em>, prepared probably in 1156, and issued in 1159(?); (3) A Confirmation of the Letter of Investiture by <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> in 1159 (?); (4) Three Letters of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, 20 September, 1172, in substance a confirmation of <em>Laudabiliter</em>. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> was not sent forward in 1156 because the offer of Adrian was not then acted on, though the investiture was accepted. Robert of Torrigny (d. 1186 or 1184) tells us that at a Council held at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>, 29 September, 1156, the question of subduing <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and giving it to William, Henry's brother, was considered; "but because it was not pleasing to the Empress, Henry's mother, <em>the expedition was put off to another time</em>" [intermissa est ad tempus illa expedite]. This clearly implies an acceptance of the investiture and supports the genuineness of the passage in the <em>Metalogicus.</em> Henry, then twenty-two, had his hands full of domestic troubles with the refractory barons in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Welsh</a>, and with the discordant elements in his French dominions, and could not undertake a great military operation like the invasion of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. And not having done so in the lifetime of Adrian, he would certainly require a confirmation of the Donation by Alexander before leading an army into a territory the overlordship of which belonged to the latter. The Letter of Confirmation is found only in <a href="../cathen/06568d.htm">Giraldus Cambrensis</a>, first in the <em>De Expugnatione Hiberniae</em> (II, v, in Rolls Series V, 31t5), and again in the <em>De Instructione Principis</em> (II, c. xix, in Rolls Series VIII, 197), where the text states that the genuineness of the confirmation was denied by some. This, however, may be a later interpolation, as some maintain. The three letters of 20 September, 1172, do not contain any direct confirmation of the Donation of Adrian. They are addressed to Henry II, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and the kings and chieftains of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> respectively. The letter addressed to Henry congratulates him on his success, and exhorts him to protect and extend the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to offer the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first fruits</a> of his victory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A point is made that there is no grant of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> contained in the letter, nor any confirmation of a previous grant, but how could we expect a second confirmation if Adrian's grant had in fact been already confirmed according to the text in <a href="../cathen/06568d.htm">Giraldus</a>? There is no question as to the genuineness of the three letters of the 20th of September. They are found in the <em>Liber Scaccarii</em>, and are printed in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> (P.L. CC, col. 882).

<p>The Donation of Adrian was subsequently recognized in many official writings, and the Pope for more than four centuries claimed the overlordship of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> In 1318 (1317?) Domhnall O'Neill and other kings and chieftains, and the whole <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, forwarded to <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> a letter of appeal and protest. They state in the letter that Pope Adrian, induced by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> representations, granted <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to Henry II, and enclose a copy of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> which the context shows was <em>Laudabiliter.</em> On 30 May, 1318, the Pope wrote from <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> a letter of paternal advice to Edward II, urging him to redress the grievances of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>, and enclosed O'Neill's letters and "a copy of the grant which Pope Adrian is said to have made to Henry II." Edward II did not deny that he held under that grant. By an Act of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Parliament (Parliament Roll, 7th Edward IV, Ann. 1467), after reciting that "as our Holy Father Adrian, Pope of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was possessed of all sovereignty of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in his demesne as of fee in the right of his <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Church of Rome</a>, and with the intent that vice should be subdued had alienated the said land to the King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> . . . by which grant the said subjects of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> owe their allegiance to the King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as their sovereign Lord", it was enacted "that all <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> shall <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> all disobedient <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> subjects, and if they neglect to do so they shall forfeit &#163;100." In 1555, by a consistorial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> followed by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, on the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> supplication of Philip and Mary, erected into a kingdom the Island of Hibernia, of which, from the time that the kings of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> obtained the dominion of it through the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, they had merely called themselves Lords (<em>Domini</em>), without prejudice to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and of any other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> claiming to have right in it or to it. [<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>. Rom (ed. <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>.) VI, 489, 490.] In 1570 the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> had offered or were about to offer the kingship of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to Philip of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a> acted as their envoy. The project was communicated to the Pope through Cardinal Alciato, who wrote to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03401a.htm">Cashel</a> (9 June, 1570):<blockquote><p>His Holiness was astonished that anything of the kind should be attempted without his authority since it was easy to remember that the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> belonged to the dominion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, was held as a fief under it, and could not therefore, unless by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, be subjected to any new ruler. And the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, that the right of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may be preserved as it should be, says he will not give the letters you ask for the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. But if the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> himself were to ask for the fief of that Kingdom in my opinion the Pope would not refuse. (Spicil. Ossor., ed. Card. Moran, I, 69). </p></blockquote>

<p>In conclusion there is not in my judgment any controverted matter in history about which the evidence preponderates in favour of one view so decisively as about the Donation of Adrian.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The principal authorities for the life of Adrian are collected in WATTERICH S Vitae Pontificum Romanorum (saec. IX-XIII) adjectis suis cuique et annalibus et documentis gravioribus (Leipzig, 1862), II. He gives the Life of Adrian by BOSO, and extracts from the annals of WILLIAM OF NEWBURGH, WILLIAM OF TYRE, ROMUALD OF SALERNO, OTTO OF FREISING, RADEWIN, and GODFREY OF COLOGNE, as well as several letters (II, 323). There is also a valuable chapter (v) of Prolegomena (I, LXXI). TO Watterich may be added JOHN OF SALISBURY and GIRALDUS CAMBRENSIS, already mentioned, RABY, Pope Adrian the Fourth, an Historical Sketch, 1849; ALFRED TARLETON, Nicholas Breakspear (Adrian IV), Englishman and Pope (London, 1906). As to the genuineness of Laudabiliter, the literature is very voluminous. The following names may be mentioned: against it, JOHN LYNCH, Cambrensis Eversus (1662), STEPHEN WHITE (d. before 1650), CARDINAL MORAN, DOM GASQUET, W.B. MORRIS, the writer in Analecta Juris Pontificii (1882), A. BELLESHEIM PFLUGK- HARTUNG, GINNELL, HERGENR&Ouml;THER, DAMBERGER, SCHEFFER-BOICHORST, F. LIEBERMANN, and O. THATCHER; in favour of it: LINGARD, LANIGAN, J. DIMOCK (editor of GIRALDUS in Rolls Series, V, 316 he says that it is indisputably genuine), J.C. O'CALLAGHAN S. MALONE, O. P.L., KATE NORGATE, A. TARLETON, L. CASARTELLI. None of these writers, except Scheffer-Boichorst, refer to the text of Laudabiliter in the Book of Leinster, which is by far the most important piece of evidence bearing on the question. An extensive bibliography of the subject is given in CHEVALIER, Rep. des sources hist. du moyen &acirc;ge (Bio.-bibl., 2d ed., Paris 905), 56, 57. Cf. also O. J. THATCHER op. cit., 154.</p></div>
