<h1>Pope Adrian VI</h1>  

<p>The last <em>pontefice barbaro</em> (<a href="../cathen/07064a.htm">Guicciardini</a>, XIV, v), and the only <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of modern times, except <a href="../cathen/09641a.htm">Marcellus II</a>, who retained his <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">baptismal name</a>; succeeded <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Pope Leo X</a>, from 9 January, 1522, to 14 September, 1523. He was born of humble parentage in <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a>, 2 March, 1459. He lost his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> father, Florentius Dedel, at an early age, and was kept at <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of his <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowed</a> mother, first at home, later at Zwolle with the <a href="../cathen/04166b.htm">Brothers of the Common Life</a>, finally at the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">University of Louvain</a>. After a thorough course in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> he was created Doctor of Divinity in 1491. Margaret of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> defrayed the expenses of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> student. His popularity as professor of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> is shown to have been deserved by his two chief works, <em>Quaestiones quodlibeticae</em> (1521), and his <em>Commentarius in Lib. IV Sententiarum Petri Lombardi</em> (1512), which was published without his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> from notes of students, and saw many editions. As <a href="../cathen/04659a.htm">dean</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04114a.htm">collegiate</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter in <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, and vice-chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, he laboured to advance the arts and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, sacred and profane, and gave universal edification by a life of singular <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and severe <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a>. In 1506, he was, happily for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, selected by the Emperor Maximilian as tutor to his grandson, the future <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, then in his sixth year. Whatever accomplishments Charles possessed, beyond the art of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, he owed to the efforts of Adrian; most precious of all, his unalterable attachment to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> of his fathers. Transferred from the academic shades into public life, the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> professor rose to eminence with wonderful celerity. Within a decade he was the associate of <a href="../cathen/15729a.htm">Ximenes</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14785a.htm">Tortosa</a>, Grand Inquisitor of the Spanish peninsula, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, and finally Regent of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. He was no less surprised than the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> when the intelligence reached him that the unanimous voice of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> had raised him to the highest dignity on earth. Appalling tasks lay before him in this darkest hour of the <a href="../cathen/11451b.htm">Papacy</a>. To extirpate inveterate abuses; to reform a court which thrived on corruption, and detested the very name of reform; to hold in leash young and warlike princes, ready to bound at each other's throats; to stem the rising torrent of revolt in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; to save <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, who from <a href="../cathen/02407a.htm">Belgrade</a> now threatened <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and if <a href="../cathen/13024b.htm">Rhodes</a> fell would be masters of the Mediterranean &#151; these were herculean labours for one who was in his sixty-third year, had never seen <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and was sure to be despised by the Romans as a "barbarian." Adrian accepted the responsibilities of his office with a full conception of their magnitude. Charles was elated at the news of the elevation of his tutor, but soon found that the new pontiff, notwithstanding his affection for him, was resolved to reign impartially. <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, on the contrary, who had looked upon Adrian as a mere tool of the Emperor, and had uttered threats of a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, before long acquiesced, and sent an embassy to present his homage. Apprehensions of a <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> were baseless; at the earliest possible date Adrian embarked for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and made his <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemn</a> entry into <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 29 August. Two days later he received the triple crown. <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">History</a> presents no more pathetic figure than that of this noble pontiff, struggling single-handed against insurmountable difficulties. Through the reckless extravagances of his predecessor, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> finances were in a sad tangle. Adrian's efforts to retrench expenses only gained for him from his needy courtiers the epithet of miser. Vested <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> were quoted against his attempts to reform the curia. His <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Chierigati, received but scant courtesy. His exaggerated acknowledgment that the Roman Court had been the fountainhead of all the corruptions in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was eagerly seized upon by the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> as a justification of their <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>. His urgent appeals to the princes of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> to hasten to the defence of <a href="../cathen/13024b.htm">Rhodes</a> found unheeding ears; on 24 October that valiantly defended bulwark of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, a disaster which hastened the Pontiff's death. His unrelaxing activity and Rome's unhealthy climate combined to shatter his health. He died appropriately on the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the Exaltation of that Cross to which he had been nailed for more than a year (14 September, 1523). His monument, erected by his faithful friend, Wilhelm Enckenvoert, is still seen at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in the national church of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, Santa Maria dell' Anima, with its quaint inscription, so often admired, to the effect that even the best of men may be born in times unsuited to their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>: "Proh Dolor! Quantum refert in quae tempora vel optimi cujusque virtus incidat" [Gregorovius-Amp&egrave;re <em>Les tombeaux des papes Romains</em> (Paris, 1859), 200, 201, 294,295]. To the times, in fact, was it owing, not to any fault of his, that the friendship of the sixth Adrian and the fifth Charles did not revive the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> days of the <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">first Adrian</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">first and greatest of the Charleses</a>.
