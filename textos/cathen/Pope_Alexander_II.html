<h1>Pope Alexander II</h1>  

<p>Reigned 1061-1073</p>

<p>As Anselm of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, he had been recognized for a number of years as one of the leaders of the reform party, especially in the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> territory, where he was born at Baggio, of noble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parentage</a>. Together with <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a>, he had imbibed in Cluny (q.v.) the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for reformation. The first theatre of his activity was <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, where he was one of the founders of the Pataria, and lent to that great agitation against <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> incontinency the weight of his eloquence and noble birth. The device of silencing him, contrived by Archbishop Guido and other episcopal foes of reform in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, viz. sending him to the court of the <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Emperor Henry III</a>, had the contrary effect of enabling him to spread the propaganda in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. In 1057 the Emperor appointed him to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>. With increased prestige, he reappeared twice in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, in 1057 in the company of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a>, and in 1059 with <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damiani</a>. Under the able generalship of this saintly triumvirate the reform forces were held well in hand, in preparation for the inevitable conflict. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a> (1059) by which the right of papal elections was virtually vested in the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a>, formed the issue to be fought and decided at the next vacancy of the Apostolic Throne. The death of <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Pope Nicholas</a> two years later found both parties in battle array. The candidate of the Hildebrandists, endorsed by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, was the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a> &#151; the other side put forward the name of <a href="../cathen/03128c.htm">Cadalus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, a protector and example of the prevailing vices of the age. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> met in legal form and elected Anselm, who took the name of Alexander II. Before proceeding to his <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthronization</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> notified the German Court of their action. The Germans were considered to have forfeited the privilege of confirming the election. reserved to their king with studied vagueness in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a>, when they contemptuously dismissed the ambassador of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> without a hearing. Foreseeing a civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> on 30 September completed the election by the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthronization</a>. Meanwhile a deputation of the Roman nobles, who were enraged at their elimination as a dominant factor in the papal elections, joined by deputies of the unreformed episcopate of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, had proceeded to the German Court with a request for the royal sanction to a new election. The Empress Agnes, as regent for her ten-year-old son, Henry IV, convoked an assembly of lay and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> magnates at Basle; and here, without any legal right, and without the presence of a single <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> was declared Pope, and took the name of <a href="../cathen/03128c.htm">Honorius II</a> (28 October). In the contest which ensued, Pope Alexander was supported by the consciousness of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of his cause, by public opinion clamouring for reform, by the aid of the allied Normans of southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and by the benevolence of Beatrice and Matilda of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. Even in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> things took a favourable turn for him, when Anno of Cologne seized the regency, and the repentant Empress withdrew to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>. In a new diet, at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> (Oct., 1062), it was decided that Burchard, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Halberstadt should proceed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and, after investigating the election of Alexander on the spot, make a report to a later assemblage of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Burchard's report was entirely in favour of Alexander. The latter defended his cause with eloquence and spirit in a council held at <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, at Pentecost, 1064 (C. Wile, Benzos Panegyricus, Marburg, 1856), and was formally recognized as legitimate Pope. His rival was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, but kept up the contest with dwindling prospects till his death in l 072. During the darkest hours of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> Alexander and his chancellor, <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Cardinal Hildebrand</a>, never for a moment relaxed their hold upon the reins of government. In striking contrast to his helplessness amidst the Roman factions is his lofty attitude towards the potentates lay and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a>, of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Under banners blessed by him Roger advanced to the conquest of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and William to the conquest of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. His <em>Regesta</em> fill eleven pages of Jaffe (Regesta Rom. Pontif., 2d ed., 4, nos. 445, 4770). He was omnipresent, through his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, Punishing <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and incontinent <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. He did not spare even his protector, Anno of Cologne whom he twice summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, once in 1068 to do penance, barefoot, for holding relations with the <a href="../cathen/03128c.htm">antipope</a>, and again in 1070 to purge himself of the charge of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>. A similar <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> was administered to Sigfried of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, Hermann of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, and Werner of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>. In his name his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damiani</a>, at the Diet of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfurt</a> in 1089, under threat of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and exclusion from the imperial throne, deterred Henry IV from the project of <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorcing</a> his queen, <a href="../cathen/02519a.htm">Bertha</a> of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, though instigated thereto by several German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. His completest triumph was that of compelling Bishop Charles of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> and Abbot Robert of <a href="../cathen/12723a.htm">Reichenau</a> to return to the King the croziers and rings they had obtained through <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>. One serious quarrel with Henry was left to be decided by his successor. In 1069 the Pope had rejected as a <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simonist</a> the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> Godfrey, whom Henry had appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> &#151; Henry failing to acquiesce, the Pope confirmed Atto, the choice of the reform party. Upon the king's ordering his appointee to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, Alexander fulminated an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> against the royal advisers. The death of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, 21 April, 1073, left <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a>, his faithful chancellor, heir to his triumphs and difficulties. Alexander deserved well of the English Church by elevating his ancient teacher, <a href="../cathen/08784c.htm">Lanfranc</a> of Bec, to the See of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and appointing him <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>.
