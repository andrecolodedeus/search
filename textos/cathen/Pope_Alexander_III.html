<h1>Pope Alexander III</h1>  

<p>Pope from 1159-81 (Orlando Bandinelli), born of a distinguished <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienese</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; died 3 August, 1181. As professor in Bologna he acquired a great reputation as a canonist, which he increased by the publication of his commentary on the "Decretum" of Gratian, popularly known as "Summa Magistri Rolandi." Called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a> in the year 1150, his advancement was rapid. He was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal Deacon</a>, then <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal Priest</a> of the title of St. Mark, and Papal Chancellor. He was the trusted adviser of <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a> and was regarded as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the party of independence among the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, which sought to escape the German yoke by alliance with the Normans of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. For openly asserting before <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> at the Diet of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a> (1157) that the imperial dignity was a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <em>beneficium</em> (in the general sense of favour, not <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> sense of fief), he incurred the wrath of the German princes, and would have fallen on the spot under the battle-axe of his life-long foe, Otto of Wittelsbach had Frederick not intervened. For the purpose of securing a submissive pontiff at the next vacancy, the Emperor despatched into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> two able emissaries who were to work upon the weaknesses and fears of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and the Romans, the aforesaid Otto and the Archbishop-elect of Cologne, Rainald von Dassel, whose anti-Papal attitude was largely owing to the fact that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> refused to confirm his appointment. The fruits of their activity became patent after the death of <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Pope Adrian IV</a> (1 September, 1159). Of the twenty-two <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> assembled, 7 September, to elect a successor all but three voted for Orlando. The contention made later, that the imperialist <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> numbered nine, may be explained by the surmise that in the earlier ballotings six of the faithful <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> voted for a less prominent and obnoxious candidate. In opposition to Cardinal Orlando, who took the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> name of Alexander III, the three imperialist members chose one of their number, <a href="../cathen/15411a.htm">Cardinal Octavian</a>, who assumed the title of Victor IV. A mob hired by the Count of Wittelsbach broke up the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>. Alexander retreated towards the Norman south and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a>, 20 September, at the little Volscian town of Nympha. <a href="../cathen/15411a.htm">Octavian's</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> took place 4 October, at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/05785d.htm">Farfa</a>. The Emperor now interposed to settle a disturbance entirely caused by his own agents, and summoned both claimants before a packed assembly at Pavia. He betrayed his animus by addressing <a href="../cathen/15411a.htm">Octavian</a> as Victor IV and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Pope as Cardinal Orlando. Pope Alexander refused to submit his clear right to this iniquitous tribunal, which, as was foreseen, declared for the usurper (11 February, 1160). Alexander promptly responded, from the ill-fated <a href="../cathen/01448a.htm">Anagni</a>, by solemnly <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> the Emperor and releasing his subjects from their <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> of allegiance. The ensuing <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, far more disastrous to the Empire than to the Papacy, lasted for seventeen years and ended after the battle of Legnano (1176) with the unconditional surrender of the haughty <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1177. (See FREDERICK I.) The childish legend that the Pope placed his foot on the neck of the prostrate Emperor has done valiant service to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> tradition since the days of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>. [See the dissertation of George Remus, <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, 1625; Lyons, 1728; and Gosselin, "The Power of the Pope during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> "(tr. London, 1853) II, 133.] Alexander's enforced exile (1162-65) in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> contributed greatly to enhance the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, never so popular as when in distress. It also brought him into direct contact with the most powerful monarch of the West, Henry II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The cautious manner in which he defended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> during the quarrel between the two impetuous Normans, King Henry and <a href="../cathen/14676a.htm">St. Thomas Becket</a>, though many a time exciting the displeasure of both contestants, and often since denounced as "shifty", was the strategy of an able commander who, by marches and countermarches succeeds in keeping the field against overwhelming odds. It is no disparagement of the Martyr of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> to say that the Pope equalled him in firmness and excelled him in the arts of diplomacy. After Becket's <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> the Pope succeeded, without actual recourse to ban or <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, in obtaining from the penitent monarch every right for which the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> had fought and bled.

<p>To crown and seal the triumph of religion, Alexander convoked and presided over the <a href="../cathen/09017b.htm">Third Lateran Council</a> (Eleventh Ecumenical), in 1179. Surrounded by over 300 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the much-tried Pontiff issued many salutary decrees, notably the ordinance which vested the exclusive right of papal elections in a two-thirds vote of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. Throughout all the vicissitudes of his chequered career Alexander remained a canonist. A glance at the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretals</a> shows that, as an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislator, he was scarcely second to <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>. Worn out by trials, he died at Civita Castellana. When we are told that "the Romans" pursued his remains with curses and stones, the remembrance of a similar scene at the burial of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> teaches us what value to attach to such a demonstration. In the estimation of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, Alexander III's epitaph expresses the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, when it calls him "the Light of the Clergy, the Ornament of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Father of his City and of the World." He was friendly to the new academical movement that led to the establishment of the great <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>. His own reputation as a teacher and a canonist has been greatly enhanced through the discovery by Father <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a> in the public <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> of the "Sententiae Rolandi Bononiensis," edited (Freiburg, 1891) by Father Ambrosius Gietl. The collection of his letters (Jaff&eacute;, Regesta RR. Pontif., Nos. 10,584-14,424) was enriched by L&ouml;wenfeld's publication of many hitherto unknown (Epistolae Pontif. Rom. ineditae, Leipzig, 1885). Even Voltaire regards him as the man who in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> deserved best from the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, for abolishing slavery, for overcoming the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Emperor Barbarossa</a>, for compelling Henry II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to ask pardon for the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of Thomas Becket, for restoring to men their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, and giving splendour to many cities.
