<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope Alexander IV</h1>  

<p>Pope from 1254-61 (Rinaldo Conti), of the house of <a href="../cathen/13683b.htm">Segni</a>, which had already given two illustrious sons to the Papacy, <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> and <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth uncertain; died 25 May, 1261, at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>. He was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal-Deacon</a>, in 1227, by his uncle <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, and four years later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>. <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory</a> also bequeathed to him his solicitude for the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, which he had 80 well befriended. On the death of <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, 7 December, 1254, the aged <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> was unanimously chosen to succeed him. We may well believe his protestation that he yielded very reluctantly to the importunities of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. Matthew of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> has depicted him as "kind and religious, assiduous in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and strict in abstinence, but easily led away by the whispering of flatterers, and inclined to listen to the wicked suggestions of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avaricious</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>". The "flatterers" and "avaricious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>" referred to were those who induced the new Pontiff to continue <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent's</a> policy of a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of extermination against the progeny of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>. now reduced to the infant Conradin in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and the formidable Manfred in Apulia. Many an historian at the present day agrees with the shrewd chronicler, that it would have been far more statesmanlike and might have averted the disasters that were in destiny for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Empire, and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, had Alexander firmly espoused the cause of Conradin. Deterred by the precedent of the infant Frederick, the "viper" that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> had nourished to become its destroyer, and persuaded that iniquity was hereditary. in the whole brood of the Hohenstaufens, he continued <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent's</a> dubious policy of calling in French or English Beelzebubs to cast out the German Lucifers. On 25 March, 1255, he fulminated an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against Manfred and a few days afterwards concluded a treaty with the envoys of Henry III of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by which he made over the vassal kingdom of the Two Sicilies to Edmund of Lancaster, Henry's second son. In the contest for the German crown which followed on the death of William of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> (1256) the Pope supported the claims of <a href="../cathen/13045a.htm">Richard of Cornwall</a> against Alfonso of Castile. The pecuniary assistance which these measures brought him was dearly bought by the embitterment of the English <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people against the exactions of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>. Manfred's power grew from day to day. In August, 1258, in consequence of a rumour spread by himself, that Conradin had died in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, the usurper was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> king in <a href="../cathen/11419b.htm">Palermo</a> and became the acknowledged head of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> party in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Alexander lived to see the victor of Montaperti (1260) supreme ruler of Central as well as Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In the north of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he was more successful, for his <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> finally crushed the odious tyrant Ezzelino. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which was under the rule of hostile magistrates and in alliance with Manfred, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority was all but forgotten. Meanwhile the Pope was making futile efforts to unite the powers of the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a> against the threatening invasion of the Tartars. The crusading spirit had departed. The unity of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> was a thing of the past. Whether the result would have been different had a great statesman occupied the Papal Chair during these seven critical years, we can only surmise. Alexander IV ruled the spiritual affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with dignity and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. As Pope, he continued to show great favour to the children of St. Francis. One of his first official acts was to canonize <a href="../cathen/04004a.htm">St. Clare</a>. In a diploma he asserted the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the impression of the <a href="../cathen/14294b.htm">stigmata</a>. <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> informs us that the Pope affirmed in a sermon that he had seen them. In the violent controversies excited at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> by <a href="../cathen/15637d.htm">William of St. Amour</a>, Alexander IV took the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> under his protection. He died, deeply afflicted by the sense of his powerlessness to stem the evils of the age.
