<h1>Pope Alexander VI</h1>  

<p>Rodrigo Borgia, born at Xativa, near <a href="../cathen/15251b.htm">Valencia</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, 1 January, 1431; died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 18 August, 1503. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were Jofre Lan&ccedil;ol and Isabella Borja, sister of Cardinal Alfonso Borja, later <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Pope Callixtus III</a>.

<p>The young Rodrigo had not yet definitely chosen his profession when the elevation of his uncle to the <a href="../cathen/11451b.htm">papacy</a> (1455) opened up new prospects to his <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/01147b.htm">adopted</a> into the immediate <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Callixtus</a> and was known henceforward to the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> as Rodrigo Borgia. Like so many other princely cadets, he was obtruded upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the question of a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> vocation being left completely out of consideration. After conferring several rich <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> on him, his uncle sent him for a short year to study <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at the <a href="../cathen/02641b.htm">University of Bologna</a>. In 1456, at the age of twenty-five, he was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal Deacon</a> of St. Nicolo <em>in Carcere</em>, and held that title until 1471, when he became <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a>; in 1476 he was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of Porto and Dean of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> (Eubel, Hierarchia Catholica, II, 12). His official position in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> after 1457 was that of Vice-Chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, and though many <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envied</a> him this lucrative office he seems in his long administration of the Papal Chancery to have given general satisfaction. Even <a href="../cathen/07064a.htm">Guicciardini</a> admits that "in him were combined rare <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and vigilance mature reflection, marvellous power of persuasion, skill and capacity for the conduct of the most difficult affairs". On the other hand, the list of archbishoprics, <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a>, abbacies, and other dignities held by him, as enumerated by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a> in a letter to the Duchess of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> (Pastor, History of the Popes, V, 533, English tr.) reads like the famous catalogue of Leporello; and since, notwithstanding the magnificence of his household and his passion for card-playing, he was strictly abstemious in eating and drinking, and a careful administrator, he became one of the wealthiest men of his time. In his twenty-ninth year he drew a scathing letter of reproof from <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pope Pius II</a> for misconduct in Sienna which had been so <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> as to shock the whole town and court (Raynaldus Ann. eccl. ad. an. 1460, n. 31). Even after his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, in 1468, he continued his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ways. His contemporaries praise his handsome and imposing figure, his cheerful countenance, persuasive manner, brilliant conversation, and intimate mastery of the ways of polite <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. The best portrait of him is said to be that <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> by <a href="../cathen/12103b.htm">Pinturicchio</a> in the <em>Appartimento Borgia</em> at the Vatican; Yriarte (Autour des Borgia, 79) praises its general air of <em>grandeur incontestable</em>. Towards 1470 began his relations with the Roman lady, Vanozza Catanei, the mother of his four children: Juan, Caesar, Lucrezia and Jofre, born, respectively according to Gregorovius (Lucrezia Borgia 13) in 1474, 1476, 1480, and 1482.

<p>Borgia, by a bare two-thirds majority secured by his own vote, was proclaimed Pope on the morning of 11 Aug., 1492, and took the name of Alexander VI. [For details of the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> see Pastor, "Hist. of the Popes", (German ed., Freiburg, 1895), III, 275-278; also Am. Cath. Quart. Review, April, 1900.] That he obtained the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> through <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> was the general <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> (Pastor, loc. cit.) and is not improbable (Raynaldus, Ann. eccl. ad an. 1492, n. 26), though it would be difficult to prove it juridically, at any rate, as the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> then stood the election was valid. There is no irresistible evidence that Borgia paid anyone a ducat for his vote; <a href="../cathen/08002a.htm">Infessura's</a> tale of mule-loads of silver has long since been discredited. Pastor's indictment, on closer inspection, needs some revision, for he states (III, 277) that eight of the twenty-three electors, viz. della Rovere, Piccolomini, Medici, Caraffa, Costa, Basso, Zeno, and Cib&ograve;, held out to the end against Borgia. If that were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, Borgia could not have secured a two-thirds majority. All we can affirm with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> is that the determining factor of this election was the accession to Borgia of Cardinal Ascanio Sforza's vote and influence, it is almost equally certain that Sforza's course was dictated not by silver, but by the desire to be the future Pontiff's chief adviser.

<p>The elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> of one who for thirty-five years had conducted the affairs of the Roman chancery with rare ability and industry met with general <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>; we find no evidence of the "alarm and horror" of which <a href="../cathen/07064a.htm">Guicciardini</a> speaks. To the Romans especially, who had come to regard Borgia as one of themselves, and who predicted a pontificate at once splendid and energetic, the choice was most acceptable; and they manifested their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in bonfires, torchlight processions, garlands of flowers, and the erection of triumphal arches with extravagant inscriptions. At his <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a> (26 Aug.), and during his progress to <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">St. John Lateran</a>, he was greeted with an ovation, "greater", says the diarist, "than any Pontiff had ever received". He proceeded at once to justify this good opinion of the Romans by putting an end to the lawlessness which reigned in the city, the extent of which we can infer from the statement of <a href="../cathen/08002a.htm">Infessura</a> that within a few months over two hundred and twenty assassinations had taken place. Alexander ordered investigations to be made, every culprit discovered to be hanged on the spot and his house to be razed to the ground. He divided the city into four districts, placing over each a magistrate with plenary powers for the maintenance of order; in addition, he reserved the Tuesday of each week as a day on which any man or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> could lay his or her grievances before himself personally; "and", says the diarist, "he set about dispensing <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in an admirable manner." This vigorous method of administering <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> soon changed the face of the city, and was ascribed by the grateful populace to "the interposition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."



<p>Alexander next turned his attention to the defence and embellishment of the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>. He changed the Mausoleum of Adrian into a veritable fortress capable of sustaining a siege. By the fortification of Torre di Nona, he secured the city from naval attacks. He deserves to be called the founder of the Leonine City, which he transformed into the most fashionable quarter of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His magnificent Via Alessandrina, now called Borgo Nuovo, remains to the present day the grand approach to St. Peter's. Under his direction, <a href="../cathen/12103b.htm">Pinturicchio</a> adorned the <em>Appartimento Borgia</em> in the Vatican, pointing the way to his <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> disciple, <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>. In addition to the structures erected by himself, his memory is associated with the many others built by monarchs and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> at his instigation. During his reign <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a> designed for Ferdinand and <a href="../cathen/08177a.htm">Isabella</a> that exquisite <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> gem, the Tempietto, on the traditional site of St. Peter's <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. If not <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a>, some other great architect, equally attracted to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the report of the Pope's liberality, built for Cardinal Riario the magnificent palace of the Cancellaria. In 1500, the ambassador of Emperor Maximilian laid the cornerstone of the handsome national church of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, Santa Maria dell' Anima. Not to be outdone, the French Cardinal Bri&ccedil;onnet erected SS. Trinit&agrave; dei Monti, and the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> Santa Maria di Monserrato. To Alexander we owe the beautiful ceiling of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Maggiore, in the decoration of which tradition says he employed the first gold brought from America by <a href="../cathen/04140a.htm">Columbus</a>.

<p>Although he laid no great claim to learning, he fostered literature and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. As <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> he had written two treatises on canonical subjects and a defence of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a>. He rebuilt the Roman University and made generous provision for the support of the professors. He surrounded himself with learned men and had a special predilection for jurists. His fondness for theatrical performances encouraged the development of the drama. He <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> pontifical ceremonies, to which his majestic figure lent grace and dignity. He listened to good sermons with a critical ear, and admired fine music. In 1497, Alexander decreed that the "Praefectus Sacrarii Pontificii", commonly called "Sacristan of the Pope", but virtually <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the Vatican and keeper of the Pope's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, should be permanently and exclusively a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> chosen from the Augustinian Order, an arrangement that still endures.

<p>Alexander earned the enmity of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, the obloquy of many narrow minded contemporaries, and the gratitude of posterity, by his tolerant policy towards the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, whom he could not be coerced into banishing or molesting. The concourse of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the Jubilee year, 1500, was a magnificent demonstration of the depth and universality of the popular <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The capacity of the city to house and feed so many thousands of visitors from all parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> was taxed to the utmost, but Alexander spared no expense or pains to provide for the security and comfort of his guests. To maintain peace among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and to form a coalition of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> Powers against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> was the policy he had inherited from his uncle. One of the first of his public acts was to prevent a collision between <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> over their newly-discovered territories, by drawing his line of demarcation, an act of truly peaceful import, and not of usurpation and <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> [Civilt&agrave; Cattolica (1865), I, 665-680]. He did his best to dissuade Charles VIII of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> from his projected invasion of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; if he was unsuccessful, the blame is in no slight degree due to the unpatriotic course of that same Giuliano della Rovere who later, as <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, made futile efforts to expel the "barbarians" whom he himself had invited. Alexander issued a wise <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/03519d.htm">censorship of books</a>, and sent the first missionaries to the <a href="../cathen/01409c.htm">New World</a>.

<p>Notwithstanding these and similar actions, which might seem to entitle him to no mean place in the annals of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, Alexander continued as Pope the manner of life that had disgraced his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> (Pastor, op. cit., III, 449 152). A stern Nemesis pursued him till death in the shape of a strong <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parental</a> affection for his children. The report of the <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrarese</a> ambassador, that the new Pope had resolved to keep them at a distance from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, is quite credible, for all his earlier measures for their advancement pointed towards <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. While still a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, he had married one daughter, Girolama, to a Spanish nobleman. He had bought for a son, Pedro Luis, from the Spanish monarch the Duchy of Gandia, and when Pedro died soon after he procured it for Juan, his oldest surviving son by Vanozza. This ill-starred young man was married to a cousin of the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and became grandfather to <a href="../cathen/06213a.htm">St. Francis Borgia</a>, whose virtues went a great way towards atoning for the vices of his kin. The fond father made a great mistake when he selected his boy Caesar as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> representative of the Borgias. In 1480, <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Pope Innocent VIII</a> made the child eligible for Orders by absolving him from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> irregularity that followed his birth <em>de episcopo cardinali et conjugat&acirc;</em>, and conferred several <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> on him, the last being the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/11437a.htm">Pampeluna</a>, in the neighbourhood of which, by a strange fatality, he eventually met his death. A week after Alexander's <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> he appointed Caesar, now eighteen years old, to the Archbishopric of Valencia; but Caesar neither went to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> nor ever took Orders. The youngest son, Jofre, was also to be inflicted upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. A further evidence that the Pope had determined to keep his children at a distance from court is that his daughter Lucrezia was <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to a Spanish gentleman, the marriage, however, never took place. It had already become the settled policy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> to have a personal representative in the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, and so Alexander chose for this confidential position Cardinal Giovanni Borgia, his sister's son. The subsequent abandonment of his good resolutions concerning his children may safely be ascribed to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counsels of Ascanio Sforza, whom Borgia had rewarded with the vice-chancellorship, and who was virtually his prime minister. The main purpose of Ascanio's residence at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court was to advance the interests of his brother, Lodovico il Moro, who had been regent of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> for so many years, during the minority of their nephew Gian Galeazzo, that he now refused to surrender the reins of government, though the rightful duke had attained his majority. Gian Galeazzo was powerless to assert his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>; but his more energetic wife was granddaughter to King Ferrante of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and her incessant appeals to her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> for aid left Lodovico in constant dread of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> invasion. Alexander had many real grievances against Ferrante, the latest of which was the financial aid the King had given to the Pope's vassal, Virginio Orsini, in the purchase of Cervetri and Anguillara, without Alexander's consent. In addition to the contempt of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority involved in the transaction, this accession of strength to a baronial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> already too powerful could not but be highly displeasing. Alexander was, therefore, easily induced to enter a defensive alliance with <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>; the league was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> proclaimed, 25 April, 1493. It was cemented by the first of Lucrezia's marriages. Her first husband was a cousin of Ascanio, Giovanni Sforza, Lord of <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a>. The wedding was celebrated in the Vatican in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, ten <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and the chief nobles of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with their ladies, the revelries of the occasion, even when exaggerations and rumours are dismissed, remain a blot upon the character of Alexander. Ferrante talked of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, but, through the mediation of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, he came to terms with the Pope and, as a pledge of reconciliation, gave his granddaughter, Sancia, in marriage to Alexander's youngest son Jofre, with the principality of <a href="../cathen/14239a.htm">Squillace</a> as dower. Caesar Borgia was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> 20 September. Ferrante's reconciliation with the Pope came none too soon.

<p>A few days after peace had been concluded, an envoy of King Charles VIII arrived in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to demand the investiture of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> for his master. Alexander returned a positive refusal, and when Ferrante died, January, 1494, neglecting French protests and threats, he confirmed the succession of Ferrante's son, Alfonso II, and sent his nephew, Cardinal Giovanni Borgia, to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> to crown him. The policy of Alexander was dictated not only by a laudable desire to maintain the peace of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but also because he was aware that a strong faction of his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, with the resolute della Rovere at their head, was promoting the invasion of Charles as a means towards deposing him on the twofold charge of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and immorality. In September, 1494, the French crossed the Alps; on the last day of that year they made their entry into <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, needing no other weapon in their march through the peninsula, as Alexander wittily remarked (Commines vii, 15), than the chalk with which they marked out the lodgings of the troops. The barons of the Pope deserted him one after the other. Colonna and Savelli were traitors from the beginning, but he felt most keenly the defection of Virginio Orsini, the commander of his army. Many a saintlier <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> than Alexander VI would have made the fatal mistake of yielding to brute force and surrendering unconditionally to the conqueror of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; the most heroic of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> could not have sustained the stability of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> at this crucial moment with greater firmness. From the crumbling ramparts of St. Angelo, the defences of which were still incomplete, he looked calmly into the mouth of the French cannon; with equal intrepidity he faced the cabal of della Rovere's <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, clamorous for his deposition. At the end of a fortnight it was Charles who capitulated. He acknowledged Alexander as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Pope, greatly to the disgust of della Rovere, and "did his filial obedience", says Commines, "with all imaginable <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>"; but he could not extort from the Pontiff an acknowledgment of his claims to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. Charles entered <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, 22 February, 1495, without striking a blow. At his approach the unpopular Alfonso abdicated in favour of his son Ferrantino, the latter, failing to receive support, retired to seek the protection of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Whilst Charles wasted over two months in fruitless attempts to induce the Pope by promises and threats to sanction his usurpation, a powerful league, consisting of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, the Empire, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, was formed against him. Finally, on 12 May, he <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> himself, but in the following July he was cutting his way home through the ranks of the allied <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>. By the end of the year the French had re-crossed into <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. No one wished for their return, except the restless della Rovere, and the adherents of <a href="../cathen/13490a.htm">Savonarola</a>. The story of the Florentine friar will be related elsewhere, here it suffices to note that Alexander's treatment of him was marked by extreme patience and forbearance.

<p>The French invasion was the turning point in the political career of Alexander VI. It had taught him that if he would be safe in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and be really master in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>, he must curb the insolent and disloyal barons who had betrayed him in his hour of danger. Unfortunately, this laudable purpose became more and more identified in his mind with schemes for the aggrandizement of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. There was no place in his programme for a reform of abuses. Quite the contrary; in order to obtain money for his military operations he disposed of civil and spiritual privileges and offices in a <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> manner. He resolved to begin with the Orsini, whose treason at the most critical moment had reduced him to desperate straits. The time seemed opportune; for Virginio, the head of the house, was a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> in the hands of Ferrantino. As commander of his troops he selected his youthful son Juan, Duke of Gandia. The struggle dragged on for months. The minor castles of the Orsini surrendered, but Bracciano, their main fortress, resisted all the efforts of the pontifical troops. They were finally <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to raise the siege, and on 25 January, 1497, they were completely routed at Soriano. Both sides were now disposed to peace. On Payment of 50,000 golden florins the Orsini received back all their castles except Cervetri and Anguillara, which had been the original cause of their quarrel with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>. In order to reduce the strong fortress of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, held by French troops for Cardinal della Rovere, Alexander wisely invoked the aid of Gonsalvo de Cordova and his Spanish veterans. It surrendered to the "Great Captain" within two weeks. Unsuccessful in obtaining for his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> the possessions of the Orsini, the Pope now demanded the consent of his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to the erection of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, <a href="../cathen/14518c.htm">Terracina</a>, and Pontecorvo into a duchy for the Duke of Gandia. Cardinal Piccolomini was the only member who dared protest against this improper alienation of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>. A more powerful protest than that of the Cardinal of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienna</a> reverberated through the world a week later when, on the sixteenth of June, the body of the young Duke was fished out of the Tiber, with the throat cut and many gaping wounds. Historians have laboured in vain to discover who perpetrated the foul deed, but that it was a warning from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> to repent, no one felt more keenly than the Pope himself. In the first wild paroxysm of grief he spoke of resigning the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a>. Then, after three days and nights passed without food or sleep, he appeared in consistory and proclaimed his determination to set about that reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> "in head and members" for which the world had so long been clamouring. A commission of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and canonists began industriously to frame ordinances which foreshadowed the disciplinary decrees of <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>. But they were never <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. Time gradually assuaged the sorrow and extinguished the contrition of Alexander. From now on Caesar's iron will was supreme law. That he aimed high from the start is evident from his resolve, opposed at first by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, to resign his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> and other <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a>, and to become a secular prince. The condition of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> was alluring. The gallant Ferrantino had died childless and was succeeded by his uncle Federigo, whose <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> was one of Caesar's last, possibly also one of his first, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> acts. By securing the hand of Federigo's daughter, Carlotta, Princess of Tarento, he would become one of the most powerful barons of the kingdom, with ulterior prospects of wearing the crown. Carlotta's repugnance, however, could not be overcome. But in the course of the suit, another marriage was concluded which gave much <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. Lucrezia's marriage with Sforza was declared null on the ground of the latter's impotence, and she was given as wife to Alfonso of Biseglia, an <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> son of Alfonso II.

<p>Meanwhile, affairs in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> took an unexpected turn which deeply modified the course of Italian history and the career of the Borgias. Charles VIII died in April, 1498, preceded to the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> by his only son, and left the throne to his cousin, the Duke of <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, King Louis XII, who stood now in need of two <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> favours. In his youth he had been coerced into marrying Jane of Valois, the saintly but deformed daughter of Louis XI. Moreover, in order to retain Brittany, it was essential that he should marry his deceased cousin's <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, Queen Anne. No blame attaches to Alexander for issuing the desired <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> annulling the King's marriage or for granting him a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from the impediment of <a href="../cathen/01178a.htm">affinity</a>. The commission of investigation appointed by him established the two fundamental facts that the marriage with Jane was invalid, from lack of consent, and that it never had been consummated. It was the political use made by the Borgias of their opportunity, and the prospective alliance of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, which now drove several of the Powers of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to the verge of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. Threats of a council and of deposition had no terrors for Alexander, whose control of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> was absolute. Della Rovere was now his agent in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Ascanio Sforza was soon to retire permanently from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Louis had inherited from his grandmother, Valentina Visconti, strong claims to the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, usurped by the Sforzas, and he made no secret of his intention to enforce them. Alexander cannot be held responsible for the second "barbarian" invasion of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but he was quick to take advantage of it for the consolidation of his temporal power and the aggrandizement of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. On 1 October, 1498, Caesar, no longer a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, but designated Duke of Valentinois and Peer of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> set out from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to bring the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> to King Louis, a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat to his minister D'Amboise, and to find for himself a wife of high degree. He still longed for the hand of Carlotta, who resided in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but since that princess persisted in her refusal, he received instead the hand of a niece of King Louis, the sister of the King of Navarre, Charlotte D'Albret. On 8 October, 1499, King Louis, accompanied by Duke Caesar and Cardinal della Rovere made his triumphal entry into <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. It was the signal to begin operations against the petty tyrants who were devastating the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>. Alexander would have merited great credit for this much-needed work, had he not spoiled it by substituting his own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in their place. What his ultimate intentions were we cannot fathom. However, the tyrants who were expelled never returned, whilst the Borgian dynasty came to a speedy end in the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>. In the meantime Caesar had carried on his campaign 80 successfully that by the year 1501 he was master of all the usurped <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> territory and was made Duke of Romagna by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, whose affection for the brilliant young general was manifested in still other ways. During the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, however, and in the midst of the Jubilee of 1500 there occurred another domestic <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. On 15 July of that year the Duke of Biseglia, Lucretia's husband was attacked by five masked assassins, who grievously wounded him. Convinced that Caesar was the instigator of the deed, he made an unsuccessful attempt, on his recovery, to kill his supposed enemy, and was instantly dispatched by Caesar's bodyguard. The latter, having completed, in April, 1501, the conquest of the Romagna, now aspired to the conquest of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>; but he was soon recalled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to take part in a different enterprise. On 27 June of that year the Pope deposed his chief vassal, Federigo of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, on the plea of an alleged alliance with the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> to the detriment of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, and approved the secret Treaty of Granada, by the terms of which the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a> was partitioned between <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>Alexander's motive in thus reversing his former policy with respect to foreign interference was patent. The Colonna, the Savelli, the Gaetani and other barons of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Patrimony</a> had always been supported in their opposition to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> by the favour of the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragonese</a> dynasty, deprived of which they felt themselves powerless. <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">Excommunicated</a> by the Pontiff as rebels, they offered to surrender the keys of their castles to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, but Alexander demanded them for himself. The Orsini, who might have known that their turn would come next, were so shortsighted as to assist the Pope in the ruin of their hereditary foes. One after another, the castles were surrendered. On 27 July, Alexander left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to survey his conquest; at the same time he left the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowed</a> Lucrezia in the Vatican with authority to open his correspondence and conduct the routine business of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. He also erected the confiscated Possessions of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> into two duchies, bestowing one on Rodrigo, the infant son of Lucrezia, the other on Juan Borgia, born to him a short while after the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of Gandia, and to whom was given the latter's <a href="../cathen/10673c.htm">baptismal name</a> (Pastor, op. cit., III 449). Lucrezia, now in her twenty-third year, did not long remain a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>; her father destined her to be the bride of another Alfonso, son and heir of Duke Ercole of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. Although both father and son at first spurned the notion of a matrimonial alliance between the proud house of Este and the Pope's <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> daughter, they were favourably influenced by the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The third marriage of Lucrezia, celebrated by proxy in the Vatican (30 December, 1501), far exceeded the first in splendour and extravagance. If her father meant her as an instrument in her new position for the advancement of his political combinations, he was mistaken. She is known henceforth, and till her death in 1519, as a model wife and princess, lauded by all for her amiability, her virtue, and her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">charity</a>. Nothing could well be more different from the fiendish Lucrezia Borgia of the drama and the opera than the historical Duchess of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. Caesar, however, continued his <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> career of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, extortion, and treachery, and by the end of 1502 had rounded out his possessions by the capture of <a href="../cathen/03216c.htm">Camerino</a> and <a href="../cathen/14013a.htm">Sinigaglia</a>. In October of that year the Orsini conspired with his generals to destroy him. With coolness and skill Caesar decoyed the conspirators into his power and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put them to death</a>. The Pope followed up the blow by proceeding against the Orsini with greater success than formerly. Cardinal Orsini, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the conspiracy, was committed to Castle St. Angelo &#151; twelve days later he was a corpse. Whether he died a natural death or was privately executed, is uncertain Losing no time, Caesar returned towards <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and so great was the terror he inspired that the frightened barons fled before him, says Villari (I, 356), "as from the face of a hydra". By April nothing remained to the Orsini except the fortress of Bracciano and they begged for an armistice. The humiliation of the Roman aristocracy was complete; for the first time in the history of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> the Pope was, in the fullest sense, ruler of his States.

<p>Alexander, still hale and vigorous in his seventy-third year, and looking forward to many mere years of reign, proceeded to strengthen his position by repleting his treasury in ways that were more than dubious. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> now contained so many of his adherents and countrymen that he had nothing to fear from that quarter. He enjoyed and laughed at the scurrilous lampoons that were in circulation in which he was accused of incredible crimes, and took no steps to shield his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>. War had broken out in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> over the division of the spoils. Alexander was still in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> which side he could most advantageously support, when his career came to an abrupt close. On 6 August, 1503, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, with Caesar and others, dined with Cardinal Adriano da Corneto in a villa belonging to the Cardinal and very imprudently remained in the open air after nightfall. The entire company paid the penalty by contracting the pernicious Roman fever. On the twelfth the Pope took to his bed. On the eighteenth his life was despaired of; he made his confession, received the last <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and expired towards evening. The rapid decomposition and swollen appearance of his corpse gave rise to the familiar suspicion of poison. Later the tale ran that he had drunk by mistake a poisoned cup of wine which he had prepared for his host. Nothing is more certain than that the poison which killed him was the deadly microbe of the Roman campagna [Pastor, op. cit., III, 469-472; Creighton, Hist. of the Papacy (London 1887), IV, 44]. His remains lie in the Spanish national church of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> di Monserrato.

<p>An impartial appreciation of the career of this extraordinary <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> must at once distinguish between the man and the office. "An imperfect setting", says Dr. Pastor (op. cit., III, 475), "does not affect the intrinsic worth of the jewel, nor does the golden coin lose its value when it passes through impure hands. In so far as the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is a public officer of a holy Church, a blameless life is expected from him, both because he is by his office the model of virtue to whom the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> look up, and because his life, when virtuous, inspires in onlookers respect for the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of which he is an ornament. But the treasures of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, her Divine character, her <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a>, spiritual authority, it is well known, are not dependent on the moral character of the agents and officers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The foremost of her <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> cannot diminish by an iota the intrinsic value of the spiritual treasures confided to him." There have been at all times wicked men in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ranks. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> foretold, as one of its severest trials, the presence in His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> not only of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> brethren, but of rulers who would offend, by various forms of selfishness, both the children of the household and "those who are without". Similarly, Ho compared His beloved spouse, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to a threshing floor, on which fall both chaff and grain until the time of separation. The most severe arraignments of Alexander, because in a sense official, are those of his <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> contemporaries, <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Pope Julius II</a> (Gregorovius, VII, 494) and the Augustinian <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and reformer, <a href="../cathen/01171a.htm">Aegidius of Viterbo</a>, in his <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> "Historia XX Saeculorum", preserved at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the Bibliotheca Angelica. The Oratorian Raynaldus (d. 1677), who continued the semi-official Annals of <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, gave to the world at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (<em>ad an</em>. 1460, no. 41) the above-mentioned paternal but severe reproof of the youthful <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>, and stated elsewhere (<em>ad an</em>. 1495, no. 26) that it was in his time the opinion of historians that Alexander had obtained the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> partly through money and partly through promises and the persuasion that ho would not interfere with the lives of his electors. <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, the scholarly <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a> editor and annotator of Raynaldus, says (XI, 4155) that it is easier to keep silence than to write write moderation about this Pope. The severe judgment of the late <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Cardinal Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, in his "Kirchengeschichte", or Manual of Church History (4th. ed., Freiburg, 1904, II, 982-983) is too well known to need more than mention.

<p>So little have <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> historians defended him that in the middle of the nineteenth century Cesare Cant&ugrave; could write that Alexander VI was the only Pope who had never found an <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a>. However, since that time some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers, both in books and periodicals, have attempted to defend him from the most grievous accusations of his contemporaries. Two in particular may be mentioned: the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Ollivier, "Le Pape Alexandre VI et les Borgia" (Paris, 1870), of whose work only one volume appeared, dealing with the Pope's <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>; and Leonetti "Papa Alessandro VI secondo documenti e carteggi del tempo" (3 vols., Bologna, 1880). These and other works were occasioned, partly by a laudable desire to remove a stigma from the good repute of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and partly by the gross exaggerations of Victor Hugo and others who permitted themselves all licence in dealing with a name so helpless and detested. It cannot be said, however, that these works have corresponded to their authors' <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Dr. Pastor ranks them all as failures. Such is the opinion of Henri de l'Epinois in the "Revue des questions historiques" (1881), XXIX, 147, a study that even Thuasne, the hostile editor of the Diary of Burchard, calls "the indispensable guide of all students of Borgia history". It is also the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandist</a> Matagne, in the same review for 1870 and 1872 (IX, 466-475; XI, 181-198), and of <a href="../cathen/12798b.htm">Von Reumont</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> historian of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in Bonn. Theol. Lit. Blatt (1870), V. 686. Dr. Pastor considers that the publication of the documents in the supplement to the third volume of Thuasne's edition of the Diary of Burchard (Paris, 1883) renders "forever impossible" any attempts to save the reputation of Alexander VI. There is all the less reason, therefore, says <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Cardinal Hergenr&ouml;ther</a> (op. cit., II, 583), for the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> charges that have been added to his account, e.g. his attempt to poison Cardinal Adriano da Corneto and his incest relations with Lucrezia (Pastor, op. cit., III, 375, 450-451, 475). Other accusations, says the same writer, have been dealt with, not unsuccessfully, by Roscoe in his "Life of Leo the Tenth"; by <a href="../cathen/03307c.htm">Capefigue</a> in his "&Eacute;glise pendant les quatre derniers si&egrave;cles" (I, 41-46), and by Chantrel, "Le Pape Alexandre VI" (Paris, 1864). On the other hand, while immoral writers have made only too much capital out of the salacious paragraphs scattered through Burchard and <a href="../cathen/08002a.htm">Infessura</a>, there is no more reason now than in the days of Raynaldus and Mansi for concealing or perverting the facts of history. "I am a Catholic", says M. de l'Epinois (loc. cit.), "and a disciple of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who hath a horror of lies. I seek the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and nothing but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> Although our weak eyes do not see at once the uses of it, or rather see damage and peril, we must proclaim it fearlessly." The same good principle is set forth by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in his Letter of 8 September, 1889, to Cardinals De Luca, Pitra, and <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a> on the study of Church History: "The historian of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to dissimulate none of the trials that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has had to suffer from the faults of her children, and even at times from those of her own <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>." Long ago <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo the Great</a> (440-461) declared, in his third <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> for <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, that "the dignity of Peter suffers no diminution even in an unworthy successor" (<em>cujus dignitas etiam in indigno haerede non deficit</em>). The very indignation that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> life of a great ecclesiastic rouses at all times (nobly expressed by <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> in the above-mentioned letter to Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia) is itself a tribute to the high spiritual ideal which for so long and on so broad a scale the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has presented to the world in so many holy examples, and has therefore accustomed the latter to demand from <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. "The latter are forgiven nothing", says <a href="../cathen/09554a.htm">De Maistre</a> in his great work, "Du Pape", "because everything is expected from them, wherefore the vices lightly passed over in a <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> become most offensive and <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> in an Alexander VI" (II, c. xiv).
