<h1>Pope Alexander VII</h1>  

<p>Fabio Chigi, born at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienna</a>, 13 February, 1599; elected 7 April, 1655; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 22 May, 1667. The Chigi of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienna</a> were among the most illustrious and powerful of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> times, an ancestor of Alexander VII was known as the "Magnificent". The future Pope's father, Flavio Chigi, nephew of <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Pope Paul V</a>, though not as prosperous as his forebears, gave his son a suitable training. The latter owed much also to his mother, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of singular power and skill in the formation of youth. The youth of Fabio was marked by continued ill-health, consequent upon an attack of apoplexy in infancy. Unable to attend <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, he was taught first by his mother, and later by able tutors, and displayed remarkable precocity and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of reading. In his twenty-seventh year, he obtained the doctorates of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in the University of Sienna, and in December, 1626, he entered upon his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> career at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 1627 he was appointed by <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> Vice-Legate of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, and he served five years under the Cardinals Sacchetti and Pallotta, whose commendations won for him the important post of Inquisitor of Malta, together with the episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. In 1639 he was promoted to the nunciature of Cologne; and in 1644 was made envoy extraordinary of <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> to the conference of M&uuml;nster, in which post he energetically defended <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> interests during the negotiations that led, in 1648, to the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">THIRTY-YEARS WAR</a>.) <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> called him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1651 to be his secretary of state, and in February, 1652, made him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1655, famous for its duration of eighty days, and for the clash of national and factional interests, Cardinal Chigi was unanimously elected Pope. The choice was considered providential. At a time when <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchmen</a> were being forced to realize the deplorable consequences, moral and financial, of nepotism, there was needed a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> who would rule without the aid of relatives. For a year the hopes of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> seemed to be realized. Alexander forbade his relatives to come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His own <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of life, severity of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, and aversion to luxury made more resplendent his virtues and talents. But in the consistory of 24 April, 1656, influenced by those who feared the weakness of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court unsustained by ties of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> interest, he proposed to bring his brother and nephews to assist him. With their advent came a marked change in the manner of life of the pontiff. The administration was given largely into the hands of his relatives, and nepotic abuses came to weigh as heavily as ever upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The endeavours of the Chigi to enrich their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> were too indulgently regarded by the Pope; but, ever <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and devout, he was far from having a share in the excesses of his luxury-loving nephews. His burden being in this way lightened, he passed much of his time in literary pursuits and in the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of the learned; but the friends whom he favoured were those who could be best relied on as counsellors.

<p>The pontificate of Alexander VII was shadowed by continual difficulties with the young and ill-advised <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV of France</a>, whose representatives were a constant source of annoyance to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>. The French prime minister, <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Cardinal Mazarin</a>, had not forgiven the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> who resolutely opposed him at the conferences of Munster and Osnabr&uuml;ck, or the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> secretary of state who stood in the way of his anti-Roman policy. During the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> he had been bitterly hostile to Chigi, but was in the end compelled to accept his election as a compromise. However, he prevented <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> from sending the usual embassy of obedience to Alexander VII, and, while he lived, hindered the appointment of a French ambassador to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, diplomatic affairs being meantime conducted by cardinal protectors, generally personal enemies of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>. In 1662 the equally hostile Duc de Crequi was made ambassador. By his high-handed abuse of the traditional right of asylum granted to ambassadorial precincts in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he precipitated a quarrel between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, which resulted in the Pope's temporary loss of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and his forced acceptance of the humiliating treaty of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> in 1664. (See <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">LOUIS XIV</a>.) Emboldened by these triumphs, the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">French Jansenists</a>, who recognized in Alexander an old enemy, became insolently assertive, professing that the propositions condemned in 1653 were not to be found in the "Augustinus" of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Cornelius Jansen</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">JANSENIUS</a>.) Alexander VII, who as adviser of <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> had vigorously advocated the condemnation, confirmed it in 1665 by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ad Sacram" declaring that it applied to the aforesaid work of Jansen and to the very meaning intended by him; he also sent to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> his famous "formulary", to be signed by all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> as a means of detecting and extirpating <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. His reign is memorable in the annals of <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a> for the condemnation of a number of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> propositions. <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Cardinal Hergenr&ouml;ther</a> praises (Kirchengesch. III,414) his moderation in the heated dogmatic controversies of the period. During his reign occurred the conversion of Queen Christina of Sweden, who, after her abdication, came to reside in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, 1655, she was confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a>, in whom she found a generous friend and benefactor. He assisted the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> in combating the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> who had gained a foothold in Crete, and obtained in return the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, exiled from <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> since 1606. (See SARPI, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">VENICE</a>.) The inimical relations between <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> occasioned by the latter's establishment of independence (1640) were a source of grave trials for Alexander, as for other <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> before and after him. Alexander VII did much to beautify <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Houses were levelled to make way for straighter streets and broad piazzas, the Collegio Romano. The decorations of the church of Sta. Maria del Popolo, titular church of more than one of the Chigi <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, the Scala Regia, the Chair of St. Peter in the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Vatican Basilica</a>, and the great <a href="../cathen/04128c.htm">colonnade</a> before that edifice bespeak alike the genius of <a href="../cathen/02510b.htm">Bernini</a> and the munificence of his <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> patron. He was also a patron of learning, modernized the Roman University, known as Sapienza, and enriched it with a magnificent <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. He also made extensive additions to the Vatican Library. His <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> by <a href="../cathen/02510b.htm">Bernini</a> is one of the most beautiful monuments in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>.
