<h1>Pope Alexander VIII</h1>  

<p>Pietro Ottoboni, born at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, April, 1610; elected 5 October, 1689; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1 February, 1691. He was the son of Marco Ottoboni, chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Republic of Venice</a>, and a descendant of a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of that city. The future <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> enjoyed ail that wealth and social position could contribute towards a perfect <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. His early studies were made with marked brilliancy at the <a href="../cathen/11387a.htm">University of Padua</a>, where, in 1627, he secured the doctorate in canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. He went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> (1623-44), and was made governor of <a href="../cathen/10704a.htm">Terni</a>, <a href="../cathen/13054a.htm">Rieti</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>. For fourteen years he served as auditor of the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a>. At the request of the Republic this favoured son was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> (19 February, 1652), and was later given the Bishopric of <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a>, in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> territory? where he quietly spent the best years of middle life. <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">Clement IX</a> made him Cardinal-Datary. He was already an octogenarian when elected to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, and lived but sixteen months, during which time little of importance was done. <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV of France</a> whose political situation was now critical, profited by the peaceful dispositions of the new Pope, restored to him <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and renounced the long-abused right of asylum for the French Embassy. (See <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">ALEXANDER VII</a>.) But the king's conciliatory spirit did not dissuade the resolute Pope from declaring (4 August, 1690) that the Declaration of Gallican Liberties, drawn up in 1682, was null and invalid. He assisted his native <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> by generous subsidies in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and he purchased for the Vatican <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> the books and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> owned by Queen Christina of Sweden. He condemned the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of a number of variously <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> propositions, among them (24 August, 1690) the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of "philosophical <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (see <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">SIN</a>); cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchiridion Symb. et Defin." (9th ed., Freiburg, 1900), 274-278; and Vacant "Dict. de th&eacute;ol. cath." (Paris, 1903), I, 748-763. Alexander was an upright man, generous, peace-loving, and indulgent. Out of compassion for the poor of well-nigh impoverished <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, he sought to succour them by reducing the taxes. But this same generous nature led him to bestow on his relations the riches they were eager to accumulate; in their behalf, and to the discredit of his pontificate, he revived sinecure offices which had been suppressed by his predecessor.
