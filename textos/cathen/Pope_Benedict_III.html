<h1>Pope Benedict III</h1>  

<p>Date of birth unknown; d. 17 April, 858. The election of the learned and ascetic Roman, Benedict, the son of Peter, was a troubled one. On the death of <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> (17 July, 855) Benedict was chosen to succeed him, and envoys were despatched to secure the ratification of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of election by the Emperors Lothaire and Louis II. But the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> betrayed their trust and allowed themselves to be influenced in favour of the ambitious and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Cardinal Anastasius. The imperial missi, gained over in turn by them, endeavoured to force Anastasius on the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. Benedict was insulted and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>. Most of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people, however, remained true to him, and the missi had to yield. Benedict was accordingly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on the 29th of September, or 6th of October, 855, and though his rival was condemned by a synod, he admitted him to lay communion. Owing to dissensions and attacks from without, the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> was in disorder, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> within its borders was oppressed. Benedict wrote to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, attributing much of the misery in the empire to their silence (cf. "Capitularia regum Francorum", ed. Boretius, II, 424); and to lessen its internal evils endeavoured to curb the powerful <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> Hubert (Ep. Bened., in Mon. Germ. Epp., V, 612), who was the brother-in-law of Lothaire II, King of Lorraine, and defied the <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">laws of God</a> and man till he was slain, in 864. In an appeal made to Benedict from the East, he held the balance fair between St. Ignatius, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, and Gregory, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14395b.htm">Syracuse</a>. He was visited by the Ango-Saxon King Ethelwulf with his famous son Alfred, and completed the restoration of the Schola Anglorum, destroyed by fire in 847. He continued the work of repairing the damage done to the churches in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> raid of 846. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> near the principal gate of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. One of his <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> proves there was no <a href="../cathen/08407a.htm">Pope Joan</a> between <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> and himself [Garampi, "De nummo argenteo Bened. III" (Rome, 1749)].

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The most important source for the history of the first nine popes who bore the name of Benedict is the biographies in the Liber Pontificalis, of which the most useful edition is that of Duchesne, Le Liber Pontificalis (Paris, 1886-92), and the latest that of Mommsen, Gesta Pontif. Roman. (to the end of the reign of Constantine only, Berlin, 1898). Jaff&eacute;, Regesta Pont. Rom. (2d ed., Leipzig, 1885), gives a summary of the letters of each pope and tells where they may be read at length. Modern accounts of these popes will be found in any large Church history, or history of the City of Rome. The fullest account in English of most of them is to be read in Mann, Lives of the Popes in the Early Middle Ages (London, 1902, passim).</p></div>
