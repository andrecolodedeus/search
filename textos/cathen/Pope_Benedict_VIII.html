<h1>Pope Benedict VIII</h1>  

<p>Date of birth unknown; d. 9 April, 1024. The first of the Tusculan <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, being the son of Gregory, Count of Tusculum, and Maria, and brother of <a href="../cathen/08429b.htm">John XIX</a>, he was, though a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, imposed on the chair of Peter by force (18 May, 1012). Nevertheless, dislodging a rival, he became a good and strong ruler. On the 14th of February, 1014, he <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> the German king, Henry II, emperor (<a href="../cathen/05047d.htm">Thietmar</a>, Chron., VI, 61), and ever kept friendly with him. The peace of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was promoted by his subjugating the Crescentii, defeating the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, and allying himself with the Normans, who appeared in its southern parts in his time. Going to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a> (Ann. Altahen. Majores, 1020; Chron. Cass., II, 47), visited the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>, and obtained from Henry a charter confirmatory of the donations of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and Otho. To restrain the vices of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> incontinence and <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, he held, with the emperor, an important synod at Pavia (1022 &#151; Labbe, Concilia, IX, 819), and supported the reformation which was being effected by the great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Cluny. To further the interest of peace, he encouraged the <a href="../cathen/15068a.htm">"Truce of God"</a> and countenanced the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> advancement of Gauzlin, the natural brother of Robert the Pious, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. This he did because, though <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a>, Gauzlin was a good man, and his loyal brother was very desirous of his promotion (cf. life of Gauzlin, in "Neues Archiv.", III). Benedict VIII was one of the many <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> who were called upon to intervene in the interminable strife for precedence between the Patriarchs of Grado and of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> (Dandolo, Chron., IX, 2, n. 2). In 1022 he received Ethelnoth of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> "with great worship and very honourably hallowed him archbishop", and reinstated in his position Leofwine, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/05396a.htm">Ely</a> (A.S. Chron., 125, 6, R.S.). A friend of <a href="../cathen/11207c.htm">St. Odilo</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny, and one of the few <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> who was at once powerful at home and great abroad, Benedict VIII has, on seemingly insufficient grounds, been accused of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The most important source for the history of the first nine popes who bore the name of Benedict is the biographies in the Liber Pontificalis, of which the most useful edition is that of Duchesne, Le Liber Pontificalis (Paris, 1886-92), and the latest that of Mommsen, Gesta Pontif. Roman. (to the end of the reign of Constantine only, Berlin, 1898). Jaff&eacute;, Regesta Pont. Rom. (2d ed., Leipzig, 1885), gives a summary of the letters of each pope and tells where they may be read at length. Modern accounts of these popes will be found in any large Church history, or history of the City of Rome. The fullest account in English of most of them is to be read in Mann, Lives of the Popes in the Early Middle Ages (London, 1902, passim).</p></div>
