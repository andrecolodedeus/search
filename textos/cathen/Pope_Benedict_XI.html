<h1>Pope Benedict XI</h1>  

<p>(Nicholas Boccasini)

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/15038a.htm">Treviso</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 1240; died at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, 7 July, 1304. He entered the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> at the age of fourteen. After fourteen years of study, he became <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, which office he filled for several years. In 1296 he was elected Master General of the Order. As at this time hostility to <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> was becoming more pronounced, the new general issued an ordinance forbidding his subjects to favour in any way the opponents of the reigning pontiff; he also enjoined on them to defend in their sermons, when opportune, the legitimacy of the election of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface</a>. This loyalty of Boccasini, which remained unshaken to the end, was recognized by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface</a>, who showed him many marks of favour and confidence. Thus with the two <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>-<a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> General formed the important embassy, the purpose of which was the concluding of an armistice between Edward I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip IV</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, then at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with each other. In the year 1298 Boccasini was elevated to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>; he was afterwards appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> and Dean of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. As at that time <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> was rent by civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishop</a> was sent thither by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> <em>a latere</em> to labour for the restoration of peace. At the time of the return of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the famous contest of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> with <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a> had reached its height. When, in 1303, the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had made themselves masters of the sacred palace, of all the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> only the two <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> and Sabina remained at the side of the venerable Pontiff to defend him from the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of <a href="../cathen/11089a.htm">William of Nogaret</a> and Sciarra Colonna.

<p>A month after this scene of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface</a> having died, Boccasini was unanimously elected Pope, 22 October, taking the name of Benedict XI. The principal event of his pontificate was the restoration of peace with the French court. Immediately after his election Philip sent three ambassadors to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> bearing the royal letter of congratulation. The king, while professing his obedience and devotion, recommended to the benevolence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the Kingdom and Church of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Benedict, judging a policy of indulgence to be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the restoration of peace with the French court, absolved Philip and his subjects from the censures they had incurred and restored the king and kingdom to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges of which they had been deprived by <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface</a>. The Colonna <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> were also absolved from their censures, but not reinstated in their former dignities. This policy of leniency Benedict carried out without compromising the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> or the memory of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>. <a href="../cathen/11089a.htm">Nogaret</a> and Sciarra Colonna and those implicated in the outrage of <a href="../cathen/01448a.htm">Anagni</a> were declared <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and summoned to appear before the pontifical tribunal. After a brief pontificate of eight months, Benedict died suddenly at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>. It was suspected, not altogether without reason, that his sudden death was <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by poisoning through the agency of <a href="../cathen/11089a.htm">William of Nogaret</a>. Benedict XI was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> in the year 1773. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and throughout the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican Order</a> on the 7th of July. He is the author of a volume of sermons and commentaries on a part of the Gospel of St. Matthew, on the Psalms, the Book of Job, and the Apocalypse.
