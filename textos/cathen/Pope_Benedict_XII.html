<h1>Pope Benedict XII</h1>  

<p>(J<font size=-2>ACQUES</font> F<font size=-2>OURNIER</font>)

<p>Third of the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, b. at Saverdun in the province of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, elected 20 December, 1334; d. at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> 24 April, 1342. Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of his parentage or boyhood. In youth he became a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Boulbonne, whence he moved to that of Fontfroide, whose <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was his natural uncle, Arnold Novelli, by whose name Fournier was also known. He studied at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, where he received the doctorate in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Meantime he was made <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Fontfroide, succeeding his uncle who was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> 19 December, 1310. In December 1317, he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of his native Diocese of Palmiers, was translated to Mirepoix 26 January, 1327, and was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a>, 18 December, 1327. On the latter's death, 4 December, 1334, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> in <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, most of whom opposed a return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, demanded of Cardinal de Comminges whose election seemed assured, the promise to remain at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. His refusal precipitated an unexpected canvass for candidates. On the first ballot, 20 December, 1334, many electors, intending to sound the mind of the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, voted for the unlikely Cardinal Fournier, who, though he was one of the few men of real merit in the college, was but lightly regarded because of his obscure origin and lack of wealth and following. He amazed the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> by receiving the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> two-thirds vote. On 8 January, 1335, he was <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> as Benedict XII.

<p>Resolved to re-establish the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Benedict signalized his accession by providing for the restoration of St. Peter's basilica and the Lateran. He was prepared to acquiesce in the petition of a Roman deputation soliciting his return, but his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> pictured the impossibility of living in faction-rent <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. They were right, whatever were their motives, and Benedict yielded. Conscience-stricken during a critical illness, he proposed as a compromise a transfer of his court to Bologna. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> urged the slender hope of securing obedience, and Benedict decided to remain at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, where in 1339 he commenced to build the massive <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> castle which still exists. Mindful always of distracted <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, he often sent money to succour the famine-stricken people and to restore churches. Reform of abuse was Benedict's chief concern. Immediately after his elevation he remanded to their <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> not needed at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and menaced with summary chastisement violators of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of residence. He revoked the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> "expectances" granted by his predecessors and forbade conferring <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em>. (See <a href="../cathen/04155b.htm">C<font size=-2>OMMENDATORY</font> A<font size=-2>BBOT</font></a>.) He condemned unseemly "pluralities" and conferred <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> with such conscientious discrimination that several were left long vacant, and so gave colour to the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> that he was himself harvesting their revenues. He inveighed vigorously against <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greed</a> for gain among <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>; regulated the taxes on documents issued by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> bureaux; made episcopal visitation less of a financial burden to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; abolished the practice of countersigning requests for <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> favours, which was extremely lucrative to venal officials; and established the Registry of Supplications for the control of such petitions. Abhorring nepotism, he granted preferment to but one relative, naming the eminent John Bauzian <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Arles in deference to the insistence of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>; he compelled his only niece to discourage noble suitors, and marry one of her own <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> rank. A legend, vouched for by <a href="../cathen/01171a.htm">&#198;gidius of Viterbo</a> (d. 1532), accredits him with saying, "a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should be like <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchisedech</a>, without father, mother, or genealogy". Monastic reform particularly engaged his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Himself a <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a>, he sought to revive pristine monastic fervour and devotion to study. Pertinent papal constitutions and visitations of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> attest his solicitude for a monastic renaissance.

<p>Being a learned <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, he was as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, keenly interested in scholastic discussions. He terminated the controversy on the vexed question as to whether the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">Beatific Vision</a> was enjoyed before or only after the General Judgment. <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> had advocated the latter view and stirred up vigorous discussion. Eager to solve the question, Benedict heard the opinions of those maintaining the theory of deferred vision, and, with a commission of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, gave four months to patristic research. Their labours terminated in the proclamation (29 January, 1336) of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Benedictus Deus" defining the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">immediate intuitive vision of God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just having no faults to expiate. Zealous too for the preservation of the Faith, he stimulated the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of infected districts to vigilance in the repression of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and urged the use of the preventive remedies of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>. He combatted energetically the anti-papal doctrines which the ecclesiastico- political theorists of the disturbed <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> period had spread, and which were unfortunately sustained by a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of misguided <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/06244b.htm">F<font size=-2>RATICELLI</font></a>, <a href="../cathen/09719c.htm"> M<font size=-2>ARSILIUS OF</font> P<font size=-2>ADUA</font> </a>, <a href="../cathen/15636a.htm">W<font size=-2>ILLIAM OF</font> O<font size=-2>CCAM</font></a>, <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">M<font size=-2>ICHAEL OF</font> C<font size=-2>ESENA</font></a>.) Distressed by disloyalty in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, he tried to persuade <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III</a> to establish the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> in his realm and urged him to assist the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to extirpate <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. But, though the most ardent foe of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, Benedict was remarkably patient and loving in dealing with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. He looked also to the union of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> through a delegate of the Emperor Andronicus, whose sincerity, however, Benedict was forced to question; manifested his solicitude for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> which, in the early fourteenth century, suffered from <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> invasions, succouring the unfortunates in temporal matters and healing <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> differences which had long rent <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a> with <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>.

<p>In purely <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs Benedict's pontificate was creditable to himself and productive of good to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Pious, prudent, and firm, he strove conscientiously to meet the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> needs at a critical period. In political relations, however, he was not so successful. Inexperienced in politics, he had little taste for diplomacy and an imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of men and affairs of the world. Conflicting political motives confused him, and hesitancy and vacillation contrasted painfully with his firmness and decision in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters. Though determined to act independently of Philip VI of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the latter generally succeeded in committing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to his policy. He helped to prevent his return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He frustrated his desire to make peace with the Emperor Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> whom <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> had <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for fomenting sedition in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, proclaiming himself King of the Romans, and intruding an <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>. Willing to absolve him should he but submit to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, Benedict exposed to Louis's delegates his generous terms of peace (July, 1335). But Philip, aided by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, persuaded the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> that his generosity encouraged <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and rebellion. Benedict yielded. Thrice the imperial envoys came to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, but French influence prevailed, and, on 11 April, 1337, Benedict declared it impossible to absolve Louis. The latter, as Benedict feared, allied himself with <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In vain the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> tried to avert <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, but he was no match for the kings and their allies. His good offices were spurned; and he was humiliated by Philip's later alliance with Louis, who had also allied to himself the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> political and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> enemies, and by the emperor's denial of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> authority over him, and, worst insult of all, by his usurpation of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power in declaring the nullity of the marriage of John Henry of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and Margaret Maultasch, that the latter might marry his son, Louis of Brandenburg. The French king hindered Benedict's projected <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the infidels, making the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> an excuse to forego his promise to lead the armies, and even diverting the money subscribed for it to financing his own <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, despite the protests of the conscientious <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Benedict's <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusading</a> ardour found solace in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where he encouraged the campaign against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedans</a> who in 1339 invaded the peninsula.

<p>Benedict XII has not escaped <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>. Reformer, foe of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, builder of the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> palace, unwilling ally of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and enemy of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, he made many enemies whose misrepresentations have inspired most non- <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> appreciations of his character. Much harm was done to his memory by the satires of <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a>, who, though befriended and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by Benedict, yet bitterly resented his failure to return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His natural obesity, too, stimulated caricature and undeserved criticism. But history offers a vindication and testifies that, though he failed to cope successfully with the political difficulties to which he fell heir, his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and pacific spirit, his <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, rectitude, and firmness in ruling, his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> and moral reform, and his integrity of character were above reproach.
