<h1>Pope Benedict XIV</h1>  

<p>(P<font size=-2>ROSPERO</font> L<font size=-2>ORENZO</font> L<font size=-2>AMBERTINI</font>.)

<p>Son of Marcello Lambertini and Lucretia Bulgarini, b. at Bologna 31 March, 1675; d. 3 May, 1758. His early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was received from tutors. At the age of thirteen he went to the Collegium Clementianum in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where he studied rhetoric, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a> was his favourite author, but the bent of his own mind was towards historical and legal studies in which latter he excelled, as well in civil as in ecclesiastical law. In 1694, though only nineteen, he received the degree of Doctor of Theology and <em>Doctor Utriusque Juris</em> (canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>). On the death of <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Innocent XII</a> he was made consistorial advocate by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, and shortly afterwards Consultor of the Holy Office. In 1708 he was appointed Promotor of the Faith; in 1712 canon <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> at the Vatican and assessor of the Congregation of Rites; in 1713 he was named domestic <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>; in 1718 secretary of the Congregation of the Council; and in 1725 <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Theodosia. He was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a> in 1727 and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> 30 April, 1728. He was transferred to the Archbishopric of Bologna in April, 1731, in succession to Lorenzo Corsini who had become <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a>.

<p>Benedict XIV is best known to history as a student and a scholar. Though by no means a genius, his enormous application coupled with more than ordinary cleverness of mind made him one of the most erudite men of his time and gave him the distinction of being perhaps the greatest scholar among the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. His character was many-sided, and his range of interests large. His devotion to <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and the serious investigation of historical problems did not interfere with his purely literary studies. "I have been reproached", he once said, "because of my familiarity with <a href="../cathen/14463d.htm">Tasso</a> and <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> and <a href="../cathen/01712b.htm">Ariosto</a>, but they are a necessity to me in order to give energy to my thought and life to my style." This devotion to the arts and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> brought Lambertini throughout his whole life into close and friendly contact with the most famous authors and scholars of his time. Montfaucon, whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, said of him, "Young as he is, he has two <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>: one for <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, the other for <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>." This last characterization did not interfere with his restless activity in any of the many important positions which he was called on to fill, nor did it diminish his marvellous capacity for the most arduous work.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and energy which Lambertini carried to this office infused new life into all his subjects. He himself explained his assiduity by saying that he looked on the episcopate not as an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, but as an opportunity to do good. His administration was exemplary: he visited all parts of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, held <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, incited the people to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> by word and example, and supervised the affairs of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> so thoroughly that nothing needing change or correction escaped him. His <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and vast learning were a source of inspiration and strength to his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and his broad firm grasp of public affairs and public questions gave him a position of unique influence among rulers and people. In his opinion the foundation of success in episcopal administration was thorough harmony between <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and this he succeeded in obtaining. Because of his wonderful gifts and his extraordinary success as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Pope Benedict XIII</a> wished to transfer him to some position of greater responsibility affording a wider field for the display of his powers and activity, but he replied in his usual jocose vein that no change of place could make him other than he was, cheerful, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyous</a>, and the friend of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. When he was transferred to Bologna in 1731 his energies and activities seemed to redouble. He became all things to all men and is said to have never allowed anyone to leave his presence dissatisfied or in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and without being strengthened and refreshed by his wisdom, advice, or admonitions. His efforts were largely directed to the improvement of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. He reformed the programme of studies in his <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and drew up a new curriculum in which special stress was laid on the study of <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a> and patrology.

<p>When <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> died (6 February, 1740) the fame of Lambertini was at its highest. Through intrigues of various kinds the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> which commenced on 17 February lasted for six months. It was composed of fifty-four <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of whom forty-six were <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a>, three French, four Spanish, and one German. These were split into several parties. One was composed of those who had been appointed by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a>, <a href="../cathen/08023a.htm">Innocent XIII</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>; another of those appointed by <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> who were known as the new college. The long, tedious session and the intense heat did not improve the temper of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>; after six months of fruitless effort and constant intrigue, the election seemed no nearer than in the beginning. Various expedients were suggested, such as the withdrawal of the names of the leading candidates and the substitution of others, but without avail. After several plans had been tried to end the deadlock, Lambertini, whose name had been proposed as a compromise, addressed the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, saying: "If you wish to elect a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, choose <a href="../cathen/16041d.htm">Gotti</a>; a statesman, Aldobrandini; an honest man, elect me." These words spoken as much perhaps in jest as in earnest helped to end the difficulty. Lambertini was chosen and took the name of Benedict XIV in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of his friend and patron <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>. As <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Lambertini was no less energetic, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a>, and unassuming than before his election. His great learning placed him in a position to deal successfully with <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> situations that needed reformation, and the broad <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> spirit which animated his dealings with foreign powers removed the pressure and hostility of even <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> courts and rulers. He was undoubtedly liberal in his political dealings, though he never lost sight of the essential interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and religion.


<h2>Public policy</h2>

<p>To go to the extreme limit of concession and conciliation seems to have been the principle that dominated all Benedict's actions in his negotiations with governments and rulers, so much so, indeed, that he has not escaped criticism even from those within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as being too prone to settle difficulties by making concessions or compromises. However his actions may be judged, whatever may be thought of his motives, it cannot be denied that he aimed constantly at peace and that few causes of friction remained after the close of his administration. Moreover, in estimating the value and effect of his concessions, it is seen that in nearly every case he strengthened the moral influence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> even though some <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of patronage or other material interests were abandoned. Nor was his influence less potent among <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> than <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rulers; the universal esteem in which he was held throughout the world meant much in an epoch, the close of which was to witness the disruption of many time-honoured institutions, social and political as well as religious. An enumeration of his principal dealings with the heads of states will show that Benedict wisely abandoned, in most cases, the shadow of temporal authority to maintain the substance of spiritual supremacy.

<p>The King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> received the right of patronage over all the sees and <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> in his kingdom (1740) and was further favoured with the title of <em>Rex Fidelissimus</em> (1748). In the matter of church revenues and the allotment of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> was also treated very generously. In 1741 permission was granted to tax the income of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and in 1753 the Government received the right of <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to nearly all the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>; in 1754 an agreement was ratified by which the revenues from all the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and in the American colonies were paid into the government treasury to carry on the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the African pirates. The King of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> received the title of Vicar of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> which carried with it the right of <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to all the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> in his dominions and the income of the pontifical fiefs in lieu of which a yearly indemnity of one thousand ducats was to be paid. Through the mediation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a tribunal was established in <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> consisting of an equal number of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> and lay members presided over by an ecclesiastic, which formed the final court for the trial of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> cases. As mediator between the Kinghts of Malta and the King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> brought a long standing controversy to a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> termination. By the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Ex omnibus christiani orbis" (16 October, 1756), the bitter controversy regarding the question of admitting to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who would not accept the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a> was brought to a close. While insisting on the authority of the <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a> and pointing out that it was the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to accept it with veneration, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> decrees that only those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should be excluded from the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> whose opposition to the pontifical constitution was public and <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a>, and who therefore should be regarded as public enemies. The title of King of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, taken in 1701 by the Elector of Brandenburg, was recognized by Benedict against the vigorous opposition of many members of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>. He was referred to as the <em>sage par excellence</em> by <a href="../cathen/09662d.htm">Maria Theresa</a>, and received many encomiums from the sultan to whom he playfully referred in his writings as the "Good Turk". At the close of his pontificate the only question of importance in the foreign relations of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> which had not been successfully settled was that concerning the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> over which the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Republic of Venice</a> and the emperor claimed control. Benedict decided that the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> should be divided between the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/06654b.htm">G&ouml;rz</a>, in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and that of <a href="../cathen/15118a.htm">Udine</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> States. This decision was regarded as <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> by <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, which in retaliation decreed that no <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, or communication of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> should be <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> within the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Republic without the supervision and approval of the Government.
<h2>Temporal and spiritual ruler</h2>

<p>As temporal sovereign Benedict governed the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a> with wisdom and moderation and introduced many reforms for the purpose of diminishing abuses and promoting the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and prosperity of the people. With a view to replenishing the treasury which had been exhausted by the extravagance of some of his predecessors, especially that of <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> under the influence of Cardinal Coscia, and because of the enormous outlay for public buildings under <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a>, he made no promotions to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> for four years. Measures were set on foot to reform the nobility, a new regional division of the city was introduced for the purpose of greater administrative efficiency, agriculture was fostered and encouraged by the introduction of new and improved methods, commerce was promoted, and luxury restrained, while the practice of <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, against which he published the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> <a href="../library/docs_be14vp.htm"><em>Vix Pervenit</em></a> (1745), was almost entirely suppressed. Benedict abandoned none of the claims of his predecessors, but the liberal use of his powers had no other aim than the promotion of the arts of peace and industry. How serious the problem was is best seen from his own words: "The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> orders, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> do not obey, and the people do as they please."

<p>In purely spiritual and religious matters the influence of Benedict left a lasting impress on the entire Church and its administration. His <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> and Encyclicals, which have played such an important part in defining and clarifying obscure and difficult points of ecclesiastical law, were learned treatises full of wisdom and scholarship. The vexed question of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, unions between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, demanded settlement in consequence of the increasing frequency with which they occurred. Much of the bitterness of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> time had passed away and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> sought to have their marriages with <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> solemnized with ceremonies equal to those when both parties were <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Though the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> prevailed in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that the contracting parties were the real <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the Sacrament of Matrimony, no general unanimity prevailed among <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologians</a> on this point. Without derogating in the least from this theory, Benedict in reply to the questions from <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in many places, especially in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, decreed by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Magn&aelig; nobis admirationis" (29 June, 1748) that <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> were allowable only under certain well-defined conditions, the principal of which was that children born of those marriages should be brought up in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, but that such marriages while tolerated, should never be performed with the ceremonies that imply formal <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> approval.
<h2>Relations with eastern Churches</h2>

<p>Under the skilful hand of Benedict a formal union was consummated with some of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a>. The frequent attempts of the Greek <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchite</a> Patriarchs of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> to obtain recognition from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> did not for a long time result in any definite union, because of dissatisfaction on the part of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> with the formulation of the Oriental creeds. In 1744, Benedict XIV sent the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> to Seraphin Tanas whom he acknowledged as <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the Greek <a href="../cathen/10157b.htm">Melchites</a> of Antioch. The conflicts in the <a href="../cathen/09683c.htm">Maronite</a> Church, after the deposition of Jacob II, which seriously threatened its unity were settled in a national council (1736), the decrees of which were approved by Benedict. On 18 March, 1751, he renewed the prohibitions of <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> against the <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasons</a>, and though very few governments regarded the suppression of this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> as demanding decisive action on their part, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were at once passed by <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and in 1757 by <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. The controversy in regard to Chinese and Malabar customs, or the system of accommodation to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> which some missionaries had permitted their converts to practice, and by which it was said that <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> practices had been grafted on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, was terminated by Benedict XIV who issued two <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> on the subject, and required the missionaries to take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that such abuses would not be tolerated in the future. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ex quo singulari", in regard to the abuses in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, was published 11 July, 1742; that in regard to <a href="../cathen/09558a.htm">Malabar</a>, "Omnium sollicitudinum", 12 September, 1744. (See <a href="../cathen/03669a.htm">CHINA</a>, <a href="../cathen/09558b.htm">INDIA</a>.) Because of the manner in which church festivals had been multiplied, Benedict strove to diminish them. This he did in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in 1742, in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> in 1748, and later in <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>. Such a move met with much opposition from many <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. Benedict silenced their reproaches by saying that fewer feasts observed in a more <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> manner would contribute more to the glory of religion.
<h2>Liturgical reforms</h2>

<p>In <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> matters Benedict XIV was extremely conservative. He viewed with grief the profound changes which had been introduced into the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">Calendar</a> since the time of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>. The increase in the number of Feasts of Saints and the multiplication of offices with the rank of <em>Duplex</em> had superseded the old <a href="../cathen/06043a.htm">ferial</a> and dominical offices, and throughout his entire pontificate he set himself determinedly against the introduction of any new offices in the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, a policy which he adhered to so strictly that the only change it underwent during his administration was that <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo the Great</a> received the title of Doctor. So profoundly impressed was he with the necessity of a thorough revision of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> which would eliminate those portions with which the critical sense of the eighteenth century found fault that he commissioned the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Fabio Danzetto, to prepare a report on the subject. This report in four volumes of notes was of such a sweeping character that it is said to have caused Benedict to desist from his project. The plan of reforming the Roman Martyrology was, however, carried to a successful issue, and a new edition was published by his authority in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1748. The same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the "C&aelig;remoniale Episcoporum", which <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> undertook to reform and which Benedict XIV published (1752) in the now usual form. The classical work of Benedict on <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> matters is his "De Servorum Dei Beatificatione et de Beatorum Canonizatione" which still regulates the process of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification and canonization</a>. Other important <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> writings of Benedict deal with the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the Mass</a> and the feasts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, and some <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Besides these he published numerous works on the rites of the Greeks and Orientals; <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> and Briefs on the celebration of the octave of the Holy Apostles, against the use of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> images, on the blessing of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, against profane music in churches, on the <a href="../cathen/06629a.htm">golden rose</a>, etc.

<p>In order that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> should not be deficient in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and historical <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and that they might not lack opportunity to profit by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> progress of the period, he founded at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> four academies for the study of Roman antiquities, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquities, the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> and the councils, and the history of canon law and liturgy. He also established a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> museum, and commissioned Joseph Assemani to prepare a catalogue of the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> in the Vatican Library, which he enriched by the purchase of the Ottobonian Library containing 3,300 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of unique value and importance. He founded chairs of chemistry and mathematics in the Roman <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> known as the Sapienza, and many others for <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, etc., at other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. Over all these foundations he exercised the closest supervision; he also found time to carry out many schemes for the building and adornment of churches in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The fact that Benedict never raised a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> is attributed to his hostility to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>; on the other hand, it must be noted that it was to a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Emmanuel Azevedo, that he committed the complete edition of his works (1747-51). He had been long urged by his friends Cardinals <a href="../cathen/11521c.htm">Passionei</a> and Archinto to order a thorough reformation of that body, but it was not until the last year of his life that any decisive action was taken. On 1 April, 1758, he issued a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> by which Cardinal Saldanha was commissioned to inspect all the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">colleges</a> and houses of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and to undertake a reform of the same, but this authority was withdrawn by his successor, <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a>.

<p>Benedict XIV sought recreation in the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of learned men and artists, among whom he shone as a wit and a scholar. Gay, lively, and talkative, his conversation at times amazed, if it did not shock, the staid sensibilities of some of the dignified courtiers who came in contact with him. Mild and gracious in his demeanour to all who approached him, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was at times lacking neither in energy nor spirit. On one occasion a violent scene took place in which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> expressed in a most decided manner his disapproval of the tactics of the French court. <a href="../cathen/03694a.htm">Choiseul</a>, the French ambassador, called at the Vatican to request that the appointment of Cardinal Archinto to succeed Cardinal Valenti as Secretary of State be deferred until after some matters in which the French king was interested were decided. <a href="../cathen/03694a.htm">Choiseul</a> himself gives an account of this scene (Letters, p. 169), without, however, relating all the details. The conversation was more lively than <a href="../cathen/03694a.htm">Choiseul</a> reported, and from the "M&eacute;moires" of the Baron de Besonval (p. 106) we learn that when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had grown tired of the importunities of <a href="../cathen/03694a.htm">Choiseul</a> he seized him by the arm and pushing him into his own seat said: "Be <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> yourself" (<em>Fa el Papa</em>). <a href="../cathen/03694a.htm">Choiseul</a> replied: "No, Holy Father, let us each do his part. You continue to be <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and I shall be ambassador." This brusqueness, however, was not usual with Benedict. He could be gay as well as serious. The Abbate Galiani once presented him with a collection of minerals saying: <em>Dic ut lapides isti panes fiant</em> (Command that these stones be made bread), and the hint was not lost. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> requested was performed and the abb&eacute; received a pension.

<p>To his subjects Benedict was an idol. If they complained at times that he wrote too much and governed them too little, they all agreed that he spoke well and wittily, and his jokes and bon mots were the delight of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Cares of state, after his elevation to the pontificate prevented him from devoting himself as much as he would have wished to his studies of former days; but he never lacked <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> stimulus. He surrounded himself with such men as <a href="../cathen/12614d.htm">Quirini</a>, Garampi, Borgia, Muratori, and carried on an active correspondence with scholars of many shades of opinion. His <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> pre-eminence was not only a source of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but formed a strong bond with many not of the Faith. Voltaire dedicated to him his "Mahomet" with the words: "Au chef de la v&eacute;ritable religion un &eacute;crit contre le fondateur d'une religion fausse et barbare". On another occasion he composed for a portrait of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the following distich: <blockquote> Lambertinus hic est, Rom&aelig; decus, et pater orbis <br>Qui mundum scriptis docuit, virtutibus ornat.

<p>(This is Lambertini, the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the father of the world, <br>who teaches that world by his writings and honours by his virtues.) </blockquote>

<p>The distich caused discussion regarding the quantity of "hic", but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> defended the prosody of Voltaire who confirmed his opinion by a quotation from Virgil which he said ought to be the epitaph of Benedict.

<p>Great as a man, a scholar, an administrator, and a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Benedict's claim to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> rests principally on his admirable <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writings. The most important of them, besides those already mentioned, are: "Institutiones Ecclesiastic&aelig;", written in Italian, but translated into Latin by P. Ildephonsus a S. Carolo; it is a collection of 107 documents, principally pastoral letters, letters to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and others, independent treatises, instructions, etc., all of which are really scientific dissertations on subjects connected with church law or the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; the classical work "De Synodo Dioecesan&#226;", published after his elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, an adaptation to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> administration of the general ecclesiastical law; this book is called by Schulte, because of its influence, one of the most important, if not the most important, modern work in canon law; "Casus Conscienti&aelig; de mandato Prosp. Lambertini Archiep. Bonon propositi et resoluti", valuable for the lawyer as well as the confessor; "Bullarum Benedicti XIV", which contains the legislation of his pontificate, many of its documents being scientific treatises. He also compiled a "Thesaurus Resolutionum Sacr&aelig; Congregationis Concilii", the first attempt at a scientific presentation of the "Praxis" of the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman Congregations</a>. A complete edition of his works appeared at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1747-51) in twelve folio volumes, by Emmanuel Azevedo, S.J., who also translated into Latin the Italian documents. A better and more complete edition is that of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1788. The latest and most serviceable (Prato, 1844) is in seventeen volumes. Some letters of Benedict were published by Kraus: "Briefe Benedicts XIV an den Canonicus Pier Francesco Peggi in Bologna (1729-1758) nebst Benedicts Diarium des Conclaves von 1740" (2d ed., Freiburg, 1888). Cf. Batiffol, "Inventaire des lettres in&eacute;dites du Pape B&eacute;noit XIV" (Paris, 1894); R. De Martinis, "Acta Benedicti XIV"; (Naples, 1884, <em>passim</em>). In 1904 Heiner edited three hitherto unpublished treatises of Benedict XIV on rites, the feasts of the Apostles, and the Sacraments.
