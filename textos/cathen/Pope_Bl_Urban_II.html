<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope Bl. Urban II</h1>  

<p>(Otho, Otto or Odo of Lagery), 1088-1099, born of a knightly <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, at <a href="../cathen/03566a.htm">Ch&acirc;tillon-sur-Marne</a> in the province of Champagne, about 1042; died 29 July, 1099. Under <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a> (afterwards founder of the <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a>) Otho studied at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, where he later became canon and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>. About 1070 he retired to Cluny and was professed there under the great <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> <a href="../cathen/07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a>. After holding the office of prior he was sent by <a href="../cathen/07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as one of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> asked for by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, and he was of great assistance to <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> in the difficult task of reforming the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1078 he became <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> and <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory's</a> chief adviser and helper. During the years 1082 to 1085 he was <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. While returning to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1083 he was made <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07230a.htm">Emperor Henry IV</a>, but was soon liberated. Whilst in Saxony (1084-5) he filled many of the vacant sees with men faithful to <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> and deposed those whom the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had condemned. He held a great synod at Quedlinburg in Saxony in which the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert of Ravenna</a> and his adherents were <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> by name. <a href="../cathen/15410a.htm">Victor III</a> had already been elected when Otho returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1085. Otho appears to have opposed Victor at first, not through any animosity or want of good will, but because he judged it better, at so critical a time, that Victor should resign the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> he was unwilling to retain. After Victor's death a summons was sent to as many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Gregorian party as possible to attend a meeting at <a href="../cathen/14518c.htm">Terracina</a>. It was made known at this meeting that Otho had been suggested by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> and Victor as their successor. Accordingly, on 12 March, 1088, he was unanimously elected, taking the title of Urban II. His first act was to proclaim his election to the world, and to exhort the princes and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had been loyal to <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> to continue in their allegiance: he declared his intention of following the policy and example of his great predecessor--"all that he rejected, I reject, what he condemned I condemn, what he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> I embrace, what he considered as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, I confirm and approve".

<p>It was a difficult task which confronted the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. To enter <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was impossible. The Normans, on whom together with Matilda he could alone rely, were engaged in civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Roger and Bohemund had to be reconciled before anything could be done, and to effect this the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> set out for <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. He met Roger at Troina, but history is silent as to what took place between them. The year following, however, saw peace between the two princes, and Urban's first entry into <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in November, 1088, is said by some to have been made possible by Norman troops. His plight in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was truly pitiable; the whole city practically was in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, and Urban had to take refuge on the Island of St. Bartholomew, the approach being guarded by <a href="../cathen/01447a.htm">Pierleone</a>, who had turned the theatre of Marcellus on the left bank of the river into a fortress. Nor was the outlook in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> calculated to hold out hopes of the triumph of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> party; its stoutest adherents in the episcopate had died, and Henry was steadily gaining ground. From amidst the poverty and want of his wretched island, Urban launched sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against emperor and <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> alike. <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert</a> retorted by holding a synod in St. Peter's before which he cited Urban to appear. The troops of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> met in a desperate encounter which lasted three days; <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert</a> was driven from the city, and Urban entered St. Peter's in triumph. He was now determined to unite his partisans in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The Countess Matilda had lost her first husband, Godfrey of Lorraine. She was now well advanced in years, but this did not prevent her marriage with Count Welf of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, a youth of eighteen, whose father, Duke of Welf IV of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, was in arms against Henry. Urban now turned his steps southwards again. In the autumn of 1089 seventy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> met him in synod at Melfi, where decrees against <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> marriage were <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. In December he turned back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but not before he had effected a lasting peace between Roger and Bohemund, and had received their full allegiance. The fickle Romans had again renounced him on the news of Henry's success against Matilda in north <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and had summoned <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert</a> back to the city. The latter celebrated <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> in St. Peter's whilst Urban <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> him from without the walls.

<p>For three years Urban was compelled to wander an exile about southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He spent the time holding councils and improving the character of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. Meanwhile Henry at last suffered a check from Matilda's forces at <a href="../cathen/03298a.htm">Canossa</a>, the same fortress which had witnessed his humiliation before <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a>. His son Conrad, appalled, it is said, at his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> depravity, and refusing to become his partner in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, fled to the faction of Matilda and Welf. The Lombard League--Milan, <a href="../cathen/09322b.htm">Lodi</a>, <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>--welcomed him and he was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> king in <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, the centre of the imperial power in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The way was now clear for Urban's entry into <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but still the partisans of <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert</a> held the strong places of the city. This time the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> took up his residence in the fortress of the Frangipani, a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> which had remained faithful to him and which was entrenched under the Palatine near the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Sta. Maria Nuova. His condition was piteous, for he had to depend on charity and was already deeply in <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a>. A <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Gregory of Vend&ocirc;me, hearing of Urban's plight, hurried to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> "that he might become a sharer of his sufferings and labour and relieve his want". In return for this he was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal Deacon</a> of Sta. Prisca. Shortly before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1094, the governor of the Lateran palace offered to surrender it to Urban on payment of a large sum of money. This money Gregory of Vend&ocirc;me supplied by selling certain possessions of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; Urban entered the Lateran in time for the Paschal solemnity, and sat for the first time on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne just six years after his election at <a href="../cathen/14518c.htm">Terracina</a>.



<p>But it was no time for tarrying long in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Henry's cause was steadily growing weaker, and Urban hurried north to hold a council at <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> in the interests of peace and reform. The unfortunate Praxedis, Henry's second wife, had suffered wrongs which were now the common <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. Her cause was heard, Henry not even attempting to defend himself. She was publicly declared innocent and absolved from any censure. Then the case of Philip of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, who had repudiated his wife <a href="../cathen/02519a.htm">Bertha</a> and espoused Bertrada, the wife of Fulk of Anjou, was dealt with. Several <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had recognized the union, but Archbishop Hugh of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> had had the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> Philip for <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Both king and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> were summoned to the council, and both failed to appear. Philip was granted a further respite, but Hugh was suspended from his office. At this council Urban was able to broach the subject of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. The Eastern Emperor, Alexius I, had sent an embassy to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> asking for help against the Seljuk <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> who were a serious menace to the Empire of Constantinople. Urban succeeded in inducing many of those present to promise to help Alexius, but no definite step was taken by Urban till a few months later, when he summoned the most famous of his councils, that at <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> in Auvergne. The council met in November, 1095; thirteen <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, two hundred and twenty-five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and over ninety <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> answered the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> summons. The synod met in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Notre-Dame du Port and began by reiterating the Gregorian Decrees against <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, investiture, and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> marriage. The sentence, which for some months had been threatening Philip of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, was now launched against him, and he was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> for <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Then the burning question of the East was discussed. Urban's reception in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had been most enthusiastic, and enthusiasm for the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> had spread as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> journeyed on from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Thousands of nobles and <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> had met together for the council. It was decided that an army of horse and foot should march to rescue <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and the Churches of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. A plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> was granted to all who should undertake the journey <em>pro sola devotione</em>, and further to help the movement, the <a href="../cathen/15068a.htm">Truce of God</a> was extended, and the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of those who had taken the cross was to be looked upon as sacred. Those who were unfitted for the expedition were forbidden to undertake it, and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were exhorted to take the advice of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> before starting. Coming forth from the church the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> addressed the immense multitude. He used his wonderful gifts of eloquence to the utmost, depicting the captivity of the Sacred City where <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had suffered and died--"Let them turn their weapons dripping with the blood of their brothers against the enemy of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>. Let them--oppressors of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, murderers and violaters of churches, robbers of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of others, vultures drawn by the scent of battle--let them hasten, if they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, under their captain <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to the rescue of Sion." When the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ceased to speak a mighty shout of <em>Deus lo volt</em> rose from the throng. His most sanguine hopes had not anticipated such enthusiasm as now prevailed. He was urged repeatedly to lead the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> in person, but he appointed Ademar, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09185b.htm">Le Puy</a>, in his stead, and leaving Clermont travelled from city to city in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> preaching the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a>. Letters were sent to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had been unable to attend the council, and preachers were sent all over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to arouse enthusiasm. In every possible way Urban encouraged people to take the cross, and he did not easily dispense from their <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> those who had once bound themselves to undertake the expedition.

<p>In March, 1096, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> held a synod at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> and confirmed the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of the French king, which certain members of the French episcopate had endeavoured to remove. In July, 1096, the king, having dismissed Bertrada, was absolved by Urban in a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at <a href="../cathen/11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a>, but having relapsed, he was again <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in 1097. Some of the greater <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had now to be brought to subjection to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, amongst them being the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Vienne, who had refused to abide by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decision regarding the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a>, who had declined to recognize the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>. After a triumphal progress through <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Urban returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. On his way to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he met the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusading</a> princes at <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, and bestowed the banner of St. Peter upon Hugh of Vermandois. It is said by some that this <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusading</a> host enabled Urban to enter <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which at this time was again held by the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>. If this was so, the entry appears, according to the statement of an eyewitness to have been effected without fighting. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the presence of well-disciplined troops, under the most distinguished <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, struck terror into the wild partisans of <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert</a>. But Urban's final triumph over the "imbecile" was now assured. Northern and central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> were in the power of Matilda and Conrad, and Henry was at last forced to leave <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. A council was held in the Lateran in 1097, and before the end of the year Urban was able to go south again to solicit help from the Normans to enable him to regain the Castle of S. Angelo. The castle capitulated in August, 1098. He was now enabled to enjoy a brief period of repose after a life of incessant activity and fierce strife, which had brought exile and want. His friendship with the Normans was strengthened by the appointment of Count Roger as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had been almost swept away by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>; the <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">antipope</a> was within his Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, and Henry's power, though strengthened by Count Welf, who had forsaken Matilda, was not strong enough to be any longer a serious menace.

<p>In October, 1098, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> held a council at <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a> with the intention of reconciling the Greeks and Latins on the question of the <a href="../cathen/06073a.htm"><em>filioque</em></a>; one hundred and eighty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> attended, amongst whom was <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm of Canterbury</a>, who had fled to Urban to lay before him his complaints against the Red King. The close of November saw the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> again in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; it was his final return to the city. Here he held his last council in April, 1099. Once more he raised his eloquent voice on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, and many responded to his call. On 15 July, 1099, <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> fell before the attack of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>, but Urban did not live to hear the news. He died in the house of <a href="../cathen/01447a.htm">Pierleone</a> which had so often given him shelter. His remains could not be buried in the Lateran because of <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert's</a> followers who were still in the city, but were conveyed to the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of St. Peter's where they were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> close to the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/01155b.htm">Adrian I</a>. Guibert of Nogent asserts that <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought at the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Urban, who appears as a saint in many of the Martyrologies. Thus there seems to have been a cult of Urban II from the time of his death, though the feast (29 July) has never been extended to the Universal Church. Amongst the figures <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of the oratory built by <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Calixtus II</a> in the Lateran Palace is that of Urban II with the words <em>sanctus Urbanus secundus</em> beneath it. The head is <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> by a square nimbus, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is represented at the feet of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a>. The formal act of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> did not take place till the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. The cause was introduced by Mgr Langenieux, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, in 1878, and after it had gone through the various stages the decision was given by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> on 14 July, 1881.
