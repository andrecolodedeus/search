<h1>Pope Blessed Victor III</h1>  

<p>(DAUFERIUS or DAUFAR).

<p>Born in 1026 or 1027 of a non-regnant branch of the Lombard dukes of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>; died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 16 Sept., 1087. Being an only son his desire to embrace the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> state was strenuously opposed by both his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. After his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> death in battle with the Normans, 1047, he fled from the marriage which had been arranged for him and though brought back by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>, eventually after a second flight to Cava obtained permission to enter the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of S. Sophia at <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> where he received the name of Desiderius. The life at S. Sophia was not strict enough for the young <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> who betook himself first to the island <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Tremite in the Adriatic and in 1053 to some <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> at Majella in the Abruzzi. About this time he was brought to the notice of <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">St. Leo IX</a> and it is probable that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> employed him at <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> to negotiate peace with the Normans after the fatal battle of Civitate. Somewhat later Desiderius attached himself to the Court of Victor II at Florence and there met two <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, with whom he returned to their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in 1055. He joined the community, and was shortly afterwards appointed superior of the dependent house at <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>. In 1057 <a href="../cathen/14290c.htm">Stephen IX (X)</a> who had retained the abbacy of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> came thither and at <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> himself to be dying, ordered the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to elect a new <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Their choice fell on Desiderius. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> recovered, and, desiring to retain the abbacy during his lifetime, appointed the abbot-designate his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> for Constantinople. It was at <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a>, when about to sail for the East, that the news of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> death reached Desiderius. Having obtained a safe-conduct from <a href="../cathen/07072b.htm">Robert Guiscard</a>, the Norman Count (later Duke) of Apulia, he returned to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and was duly installed by Cardinal Humbert on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Day</a>, 1058. A year later he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a> of the title of S. Cecilia and received the abbatial blessing.

<p>Desiderius was the greatest of all the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> with the exception of the founder, and as such won for himself "imperishable fame" (Gregorovius). He rebuilt the church and conventual buildings, established <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of art and re-established monastic discipline so that there were 200 <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in his day (see <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">MONTE CASSINO</a>). On 1 Oct., 1071, the new and magnificent Basilica of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a>. Desiderius's great reputation brough to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> many gifts and exemptions. The money was spent on church ornaments of which the most notable were a great golden altar front from Constantinople, adorned with gems and enamels and "nearly all the church ornaments of Victor II which had been pawned here and there throughout the city" [Chron. Cass., III, 18 (20)]. The bronze and silver doors of the Cassinese Basilica which Desiderius erected remain, and in the Church of S. Angelo in Formis near <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a> some of the frescoes executed by his orders may still be seen. <a href="../cathen/11783c.htm">Peter the Deacon</a> gives (op. cit., III, 63) a list of some seventy books which Desiderius caused to be copied at <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>; they include works of Sts. Augustine, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Bede</a>, Basil, <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">Jerome</a>, <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, and Cassian, the registers of Popes Feliz and Leo, the histories of <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, Paul Warnfrid, Jordanus, and <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a>, the "Institutes" and "Novels" of Justinian, the works of Terence, Virgil, and Seneca, Cicero's "De natura deorum", and Ovid's "Fasti".

<p>Desiderius had been appointed <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> vicar for Campania, Apulia, Calabria, and the Principality of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Beneventum</a> with special powers for the reform of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; so great was his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> that he "was allowed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiff</a> to appoint Bishops and Abbots from among his brethren in whatever churches or <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> he desired of those which had been <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowed</a> of their patron" (Chron. Cas., III, 34).

<p>Within two years of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the Cassinese Basilica, Pope Alexander died and was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a>. Undoubtedly the chief importance of Desiderius in <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history</a> lies in his influence with the Normans, an influence which he was able repeatedly to exert in favour of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Already in 1059 he had persuaded <a href="../cathen/07072b.htm">Robert Guiscard</a> and Richard of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a> to become vassals of St. Peter for their newly conquered territories: now <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> immediately after his election sent for him to give an account of the state of Norman <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and entrusted him with the negotiation of an interview with <a href="../cathen/07072b.htm">Robert Guiscard</a>. This took place on 2 Aug., 1073, at <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>. In 1074 and 1075 he acted as intermediary, probably as <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory's</a> agent, between the Norman princes themselves, and even when the latter were at open <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, they still maintained the best relations with <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> (end of 1076). At the end of 1080 it was Desiderius who obtained Norman troops for <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a>. In 1082 he visited the emperor at <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a>, while the troops of the Imperialist <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> were harassing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> from <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>. In 1083 the peace-loving <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> joined Hugh of Cluny in an attempt to reconcile <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and emperor, and his proceedings seem to have aroused some suspicion in <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory's</a> entourage. In 1084 when <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was in Henry's hands and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> besieged in Sant' Angelo, Desiderius announced the approach of Guiscard's army to both emperor and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.



<p>Though certainly a strong partisan of the <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrandine</a> reform the gentler Desiderius belonged to the moderate party and could not always see eye to eye with <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> in his most intransigent proceedings. Yet when the latter lay dying at <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a> (25 May, 1085) the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> was one of those whom he named as fittest to succeed him. Desiderius was by no means willing to assume the mantle of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, experience had taught him that his power and utility lay in being a middleman, yet at a time when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was surrounded by powerful enemies his influence with the Normans made him the most obvious candidate. The Romans had expelled the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> from the city, and hither Desiderius hastened to consult with the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> on the approaching election; finding, however, that they were bent on forcing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> dignity upon him he fled to <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, where he busied himself in exhorting the Normans and Lombards to rally to the support of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. When autumn came Desiderius accompanied the Norman army in its march towards <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but becoming aware of the plot which was on foot between the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and the Norman princes to force the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a> upon him, he would not enter <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> unless they <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to abandon their design; this they refused to do, and the election was postponed. At about <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> (Chron. Cass., III, 66) the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> assembled at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> summoned Desiderius and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who were with him at <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> to come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to treat concerning the election. On 23 May a great meeting was held in the deaconry of St. Lucy, and Desiderius was again importuned to accept the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> but persisted in his refusal, threatening to return to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in case of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Next day, the feast of Pentecost, very early in the morning the same scene was repeated. The consul Cencius now suggested the election of Odo, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> (afterwards <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a>), but this was rejected by some of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> on the grounds that the translation of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was contrary to the canons. The assembly now lost all patience; Desiderius was seized and dragged to the Church of St. Lucy where he was forcibly vested in the red cope and given the name of Victor (24 May, 1086). The church had been without a head for twelve months all but a day. Four days later <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> had to flee from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> before the imperial prefect of the city, and at <a href="../cathen/14518c.htm">Terracina</a>, in spite of all protests, Victor laid aside the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> insignia and once more retired to <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> where he remained nearly a whole year. In the middle of <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, 1087, a council of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was held at <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a> at which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>-elect assisted as "Papal vicar of those parts" (letter of Hugh of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>) together with the Norman princes, Cencius the Consul, and the Roman nobles; here Victor finally yielded and "by the assumption of the cross and purple confirmed the past election" (Chron. Cass., III, 68). How much his obstinacy had irritated some of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> is evidenced in the letter of Hugh of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> preserved by Hugh of Flavigny (Mon. Germ. Hist.: Script. VIII, 466-8).

<p>After celebrating <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> in his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> Victor proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and when the Normans had driven the soldiers of the <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Antipope Clement III</a> (<a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert of Ravenna</a>) out of St. Peter's, was there <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> (9 May, 1087). He only remained eight days in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and then returned to <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>. Before May was out he was once more in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in answer to a summons for the Countess Matilda, whose troops held the Leonine City and Trastevere, but when at the end of June the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> once more gained possession of St. Peter's, Victor again retired to his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. In August a council was held at <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, at which he renewed the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> and the condemnation of lay-investiture, and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematised</a> Hugh of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and Richard, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a>. When the council had lasted three days Victor became seriously ill and retired to <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> to die. He had himself carried into the <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter-house</a>, issued various decrees for the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, appointed with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> the prior, Cardinal Oderisius, to succeed him in the Abbacy, just as he himself had been appointed by <a href="../cathen/14290c.htm">Stephen IX (X)</a>, and proposed Odo of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> to the assembled <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as the next <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He died 16 Sept., 1087, and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> he had prepared for himself in the <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter-house</a>. In the sixteenth century his body was removed to the church, and again translated in 1890. The cultus of Blessed Victor seems to have begun not later than the pontificate of Anastasius IV, about 60 years after his death (Acta SS. Loc. cit.). In 1727 the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> obtained from <a href="../cathen/02427e.htm">Benedict III</a> permission to keep his feast (<a href="../cathen/14788c.htm">Tosti</a>, I, 393).

<p>Pope Victor III is a far less impressive figure in history than Desiderius the great <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, but there is abundant evidence that it was largely his failing health that made him so reluctant to accept the great position which was thrust upon him, indeed <a href="../cathen/11278a.htm">Ordericus</a> tells us that he was taken ill when saying the first Mass after his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, so that during his <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> "he hardly got through a single Mass", <em>vix una tantum missa perfunctus</em> (P.L., CLXXXVIII, p. 578). On 5 Aug., 1087, when Victor was holding the Council at <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, an army consisting of Roman, <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a>, Pisan, and Amalfitan troops sent by him to Africa under the Banner of St. Peter captured the town of El Mahadia, and forced the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> ruler of <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a> to promise tribute to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and to free all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> slaves. This event may perhaps be considered as the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>. The only literary work of Victor which we possess is his "Dialogues" on the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought by St. Benedict and other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> at <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>. There is also a letter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> to which country he had sent <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> while still <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>. In his "De Viris illustribus Casinensibus", <a href="../cathen/11783c.htm">Peter the Deacon</a> ascribes to him the composition of a "Cantus ad B. Maurum" and letters to Philip of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and Hugh of Cluny which no longer exist.
