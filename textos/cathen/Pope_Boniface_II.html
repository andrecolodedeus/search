<h1>Pope Boniface II</h1>  

<p>Elected 17 September, 530; died October, 532.

<p>In calling him the son of Sigisbald, the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> makes first mention of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> Germanic ancestry. Boniface served the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> from early youth. During the reign of <a href="../cathen/06031a.htm">Pope Felix IV</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> and a personage of considerable influence with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>. His elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> is remarkable as offering an unquestionable example of the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by his predecessor, without even the formality of an election. <a href="../cathen/06031a.htm">Felix IV</a> apprehending death and fearing a contest for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> between Roman and Gothic factions, gathered about him several of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and a number of Roman Senators and patricians who happened to be near. In their presence, he solemnly conferred on his aged <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sovereignty, proclaiming him his successor and menacing with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> those refusing to recognize and obey Boniface as validly chosen <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. On Felix's death Boniface assumed succession, but nearly all of the Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Sixty out of perhaps about seventy, refused to accept him and elected <a href="../cathen/05018a.htm">Dioscorus</a>. They feared the undue influence in <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> affairs of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogothic</a> King Athalaric, whose Grandfather, <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric I</a>, had helped to elect <a href="../cathen/06031a.htm">Pope Felix IV</a>, a circumstance rendering more odious the latter's <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of Boniface.

<p>Both <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 22 September, 530, Boniface in the Basilica of Julius, and <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscorus</a> in the Lateran. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> was thus involved in the seventh anti-papal <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. Fortunately it endured but twenty-two days, for <a href="../cathen/05018a.htm">Dioscorus</a> died 14 October, leaving Boniface in possession. He soon convened a Roman synod and presented a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizing</a> his late rival to which he secured the signatures of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who had been <a href="../cathen/05018a.htm">Dioscorus's</a> partisans (December, 530) Each of these expressed regret for their participation in the irregular election and pledged future obedience. Boniface reconciled many by his mild, conciliatory administration; but some resentment remained, for he seems not to have been tendered a formal election by those who, despite their submission, had impugned the validly of his <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a>; and five years later a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of their choice solemnly burned the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> against <a href="../cathen/05018a.htm">Dioscorus</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/01202c.htm">AGAPETUS I</a>). In a second synod, held (531) in St. Peter's, Boniface presented a constitution attributing to himself the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to appoint his successor. The Roman Clergy subscribed to it and promised obedience. Boniface proposed as his choice the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Vigilius and it was ratified by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and. people. This enactment provoked bitter resentment and even imperial disfavor, for in third synod (631) it was rescinded. Boniface burned the constitution before the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and senate and nullified the appointment of Vigilius.

<p>The reign of Boniface was marked by his active interest in diverse affairs of the Western and <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>. Early in his pontificate he confirmed the acts of the Second Council of Orange, one of the most important of the sixth century, which effectually terminated the <a href="../cathen/13703a.htm">Semipelagian</a> controversies. Its presiding officer, Caesarius, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Arles, an intimate friend of Boniface, had, previous to the latter's succession, sent the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Armenius to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to ask Boniface to secure the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> confirmation of the council. Being himself <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> when the messenger came, Boniface sent a letter of confirmation to Caesarius (25 January, 531) in which he condemned certain <a href="../cathen/13703a.htm">Semipelagian</a> doctrines. He received an appeal from the African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who were laboring at the reorganization of their church after the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandal</a> devastation, requesting him to confirm in <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, that the latter might be better able to profit by the help of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>. In the east he asserted the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in Illyricum. (<em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/02658a.htm">BONIFACE I</a>.) In 531, Epiphanius, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, declared irregular the election of Stephen to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/09004b.htm">Larissa</a> in Thessaly. Despite the severe pressures taken in Constantinople to thwart his purpose, Stephen appealed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the ground that Epiphanius was not competent to decide the case, maintaining his point in terms which reveal a clear conception of Roman Primacy. Boniface convened a fourth Roman synod 7-9 December 531, in which some twenty-five documents were adduced in support of Rome's claim to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in Illyricum. The outcome of the synod is not known. Boniface was esteemed for his charity, particularly towards the suffering poor of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> during a year of famine. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in St. Peter's, 17 October, 532, where a fragment of his epitaph may yet be seen.
