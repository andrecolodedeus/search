<h1>Pope Boniface IX</h1>  

<p>Elected at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 2 November, 1389, as successor of the Roman Pope, <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>; d. there, 1 October, 1404. Piero (Perino, Pietro) Tomacelli came of an ancient but impoverished baronial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. He lacked good <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> training and skill in the conduct of curial business, but was by nature tactful and prudent. His firm character and mild manner did much to restore respect for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> in the countries of his own obedience (Germany, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and the greater part of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>). The <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Avignon Pope, Clement VII</a>, had just <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> (1 November, 1389) as King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> the French prince, Louis of Anjou. Boniface took up the cause of the youthful Ladislaus, heir of Charles III of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and Margaret of <a href="../cathen/05209a.htm">Durazzo</a>, had him <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> at <a href="../cathen/06333a.htm">Gaeta</a> (29 May, 1390), and for the next decade aided him efficiently to expel the Angevin forces from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In the course of his reign Boniface extinguished the municipal independence of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and established the supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He secured the final adhesion of the Romans (1398) by fortifying anew the Castle of Sant' Angelo, the bridges, and other points of vantage. He also took over the port of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> from its <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishop</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a> Boniface gradually regained control of the chief strongholds and cities, and is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> founder of these States as they appear in the fifteenth century. Owing to the faithlessness and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the Romans he resided frequently at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, and elsewhere. <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, died 16 September, 1394. Boniface had <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him shortly after his own election, and in turn had been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by Clement. In 1392 Boniface attempted, but in vain, to enter into closer relations with Clement for the re-establishment of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> unity, whereupon Boniface reasserted with vigour his own legitimacy. Clement was succeeded at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, 28 September, 1394, by <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Cardinal Pedro de Luna</a>, as Benedict XIII. Suffice it to say here that Boniface always claimed to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and at all times rejected the proposal to abdicate even when it was supported by the principal members of his own obedience, e.g. Richard II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (1396), the Diet of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> (1397), and King Wenceslaus of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (Reims, 1398).

<p>During the reign of Boniface two jubilees were celebrated at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The first took place in 1396, in compliance with an ordinance of his predecessor <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>, and was largely frequented from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Several cities of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> obtained the privileges of the jubilee, but the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> gave rise to abuses and to impositions on the part of unaccredited agents of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, so that he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to proceed against them with severity. The jubilee of 1400 drew to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> great crowds of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, particularly from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In spite of a disastrous plague Boniface remained at his post. In the latter part of 1399 bands of penitents, known as the <em>Bianchi,</em> or <em>Albati</em> (White Penitents), arose, especially in Provence and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. They went in procession from city to city, clad in white garments, with faces hooded, only the eyes being left uncovered, and wearing on their backs a red cross. For a while their penitential enthusiasm had some good results. After they had satisfied their spiritual ardour at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Boniface gradually discountenanced these wandering crowds, an easy prey of agitators and conspirators, and finally dissolved them. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the anti-papal virulence of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wycliff</a> increased the opposition of both Crown and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to the methods of Boniface in the granting of such <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> as fell vacant in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> through the death or promotion of the incumbent. The Parliament confirmed and extended more than once the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of Provisors and Pr&aelig;munire, of <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III</a>. Boniface protested vigorously, particularly in 1391, but in the end found himself unable to execute his grants without the king's consent and sanction. "Thus ended", says <a href="../cathen/09270c.htm">Lingard</a> (<em>ad. an.</em> 1393), "this long and angry controversy entirely to the advantage of the Crown." Nevertheless, at the Synod of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> (1396), the English Church condemned the anti-papal teachings of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>, and in 1398 the <a href="../cathen/11365c.htm">University of Oxford</a>, consulted by Richard II, issued in favour of Boniface an influential document, while in 1390 and again in 1393 the spiritual peers upheld the right of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> even those who obeyed the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of Provisors. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the electors had deposed at Rhense (20 August, 1400) the unworthy Wenceslaus, King of the Romans, and had chosen in his place Rupert, Duke of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and Rhenish Count Palatine. In 1403 Boniface abandoned his uncertain attitude towards both, approved the deposition of Wenceslaus as done by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority, and recognized the election of Rupert. In 1398 and 1399 Boniface appealed to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in favour of Emperor Emmanuel, threatened at Constantinople by Sultan Bajazet. <a href="../cathen/02782a.htm">St. Bridget of Sweden</a> was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Boniface, 7 October, 1391. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> (1391) and Fermo (1398) owe him their origin, and that of Erfurt its confirmation (1392). In 1404 <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a> sent the last of his embassies to Boniface, who received the agents of Benedict 29 September, but the interview ended unfavourably. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, highly irritated, took to his bed with an attack of gravel, and died after an illness of two days.

<p>Contemporary and later chroniclers praise the political virtues of Boniface, also the purity of his life, and the grandeur of his spirit. Some, like <a href="../cathen/04789b.htm">Dietrich of Niem</a>, charge him with an inordinate love of money, dishonest traffic in <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, the sale of <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a>, etc. But Dietrich is no impartial writer and is blamed by Reynaldus for being bitter and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> (<em>acertus et iniquis</em>). In his gossipy pages one misses a proper appreciation of the difficulties that surrounded Boniface&mdash;local sources of revenue lost in the long absence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, foreign revenue diminished by the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, extraordinary expenses for the restoration of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the reconquest of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, the constant <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> necessitated by French <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, the inheritance of the financial methods of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of conciliating supporters in and out of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Boniface sought nothing for himself and died poor. He is also charged with nepotism and he certainly provided generously for his mother, brothers, and nephews. It may be said, however, that in the semi-anarchic conditions of the time good government depended upon such personal support as a temporal ruler could gather and retain, i.e. could reward, while fidelity was best secured by close domestic ties. Boniface was the first <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to introduce the form of revenue known as <em>annates perpetu&aelig;,</em> or reservation of one-half the first year's fruits of every <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> granted in the Roman Court, this in addition to other traditional expenses. It must be remembered that at this time the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> claimed a large part of these revenues, so that the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> was perhaps more responsible than the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for new financial methods destined in the next century to arouse bitter feelings against <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, particularly in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>.
