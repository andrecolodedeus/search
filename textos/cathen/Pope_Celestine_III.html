<h1>Pope Celestine III</h1>  

<p>(GIACINTO BOBONE)

<p>The first of the Roman Orsini to ascend the Chair of Peter, b. about 1106; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 8 January, 1198. He was forty-seven years a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> when, in his eighty-fifth year, he was elected (30 March, 1191) successor of <a href="../cathen/04018a.htm">Clement III</a>; being only a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (13 April) and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the next day, respectively <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> and <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. The following day he anointed and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> King Henry VI of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> as emperor, and as empress his queen Constantia. The king was then on his way to Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to enforce against Tancred the claims of <a href="../cathen/04294a.htm">Constantia</a> to the crown of the two Sicilies. The Roman people, however, did not permit the afore-mentioned solemnities to take place until both <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and king had aided them to satisfy their wrath against the neighbouring Tusculum. The town was levelled with the ground and abandoned to the savage vengeance of the Romans. The aged <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has been blamed for this act of cruelty, in this so unlike his predecessor <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> who withstood (1142) a similar passionate insistence of the Romans for the destruction of <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tibur</a> (Tivoli). The responsibility, however, rests chiefly on the emperor, whose blood-thirsty Italian career was thus becomingly inaugurated. In spite of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the emperor proceeded southward to make good his claims to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, but was defeated and compelled to retire, leaving the empress a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> of Tancred, who freed her at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> petition. The aged Celestine astonished many by his longanimity in dealing with the young and violent Henry VI who in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> surpassed his predecessors in cruelty and oppression of the churches. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was also slow and cautious in threatening Henry with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> for his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> of <a href="../cathen/13041b.htm">King Richard the Lion-Hearted</a> whom Henry had caused to be seized (1192) by Duke Leopold of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and delivered to himself, as Richard was on the way back to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, nor was the English king set free until he had paid a great ransom (&#163;100,000). It was a violation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of nations that a younger and more vigorous <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> would not have so long tolerated. Only in 1193 were the duke and his associates <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and an attempt made to compel restitution of the ransom. Shortly after, on the death of Tancred (1194) Henry VI again crossed the Alps, resolved to finally compass the union of the German Crown with that of the Two Sicilies. Amid incredible cruelties he accomplished his purpose, defied the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as overlord of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, deceived the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with vain promises of a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, and would probably have hastened by a generation the memorable conflict of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with his son <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> had not death carried off the cruel and lawless king, 28 Sept., 1197, in his thirty-sixth year, not, however, before he had induced the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to acknowledge the aforesaid infant Frederick as King of the Two Sicilies. Celestine himself soon passed away, in the ninety-second year of his age. He showed more resolution in dealing with other princes of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, particularly in defence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> marriage <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. He induced King Alfonso IX of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a> to abandon his project of an incest union with a Portuguese princess, and defended with vigour the validity of the marriage of Queen Ingeburg with <a href="../cathen/12001a.htm">Philip Augustus of France</a>, to whom he refused a <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, while he declared invalid the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> accorded to <a href="../cathen/12001a.htm">Philip</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his kingdom. A serious <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> was the constant ideal of Pope Celestine; he confirmed the new military Order of <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a> (1191), and favoured greatly the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Knights Templar</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a>. <a href="../cathen/09565a.htm">St. Malachy</a> of Armagh, <a href="../cathen/02513a.htm">St. Bernward</a> of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>, St. John Gualbert, and <a href="../cathen/15114b.htm">St. Ubaldus</a> of <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a> were <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by him (See <a href="../cathen/07233a.htm">HENRY VI</a>.).
