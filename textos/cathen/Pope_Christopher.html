<h1>Pope Christopher</h1>  

<p>(Reigned 903-904). Some hold that Christopher, once <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of the Title of St. Damasus, a Roman and son of Leo, was an <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>. But though his manner of taking possession of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> was wholly uncanonical, he appears to have been subsequently recognized as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Hence we find his name included in all the more or less contemporary catalogues of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> (Liber Pontificalis, II, ed. Duchesne; Watterich, Pontificum Romanorum Vitae, I; and Origines de l'&eacute;glise romaine, I, par les membres de la communaut&eacute; de <a href="../cathen/14133b.htm">Solesmes</a>, Paris, 1836). His portrait figures among the other likenesses of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in the church of <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul Outside the Walls</a>, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and among the frescoes of tenth-century <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in the thirteenth century on the walls of the ancient church of San Pier-in-Grado, outside <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>. He was, moreover, acknowledged as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by his successors; for, in confirming the privileges of the Abbey of Corbie in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">St. Leo IX</a> mentioned the preceding grants of Benedict and Christopher (Jaffe, Regesta RR. Pont., I, n. 4212). This privilege is the only one of Christopher's acts which is extant (ibid., 3532, 2d ed.). He became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by forcibly dethroning his predecessor, <a href="../cathen/09159b.htm">Leo V</a>, and putting him into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, seemingly about October 903. As Leo appears to have soon died in his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, Christopher may be regarded as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> after his death. One writer, indeed, Eugenius Vulgarius, who was interested in blackening the character of <a href="../cathen/13729a.htm">Sergius III</a>, pretends that he <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> both <a href="../cathen/09159b.htm">Leo V</a> and Christopher. But his evidence is unsatisfactory in itself, and is opposed to evidence better substantiated. At this period, however, the darkest ever known in <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, when its barons were making and unmaking <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> at their pleasure, and when both <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were in such a state of turmoil that men could find no leisure to write history, we have to grope about in the dark and when we have grasped some detail we can scarcely tell whether it is fact or fiction. A Greek eleventh-century document (Mon. Gr&aelig;ca ad Photium pertinent., p. 160, ed. <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, Ratisbon, 1869) says that Christopher was the first <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> who, in his profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he sent according to custom to Sergius, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, stated that the Holy Ghost proceeded "from the Father and from the Son". The difficulty in the way of accepting this statement is that there was no Patriarch Sergius at this time. Christopher was driven from the Chair of Peter by his successor, <a href="../cathen/13729a.htm">Sergius III</a> (January, 904), and compelled to end his days as a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> (Chronicle of Hermannus Contractus, ad an. 904), though Vulgarius says he was strangled in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> [D&uuml;mmler, Auxilius und Vulgarius (Leipzig, 1866), 160, 135].
