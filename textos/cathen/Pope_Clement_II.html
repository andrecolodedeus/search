<h1>Pope Clement II</h1>  

<p>(S<font size=-2>UIDGER</font>.)

<p>Date of birth unknown; <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> 25 December, 1046; d. 9 October, 1047. In the autumn of 1046 the King of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Henry III, crossed the Alps at the head of a large army and accompanied by a brilliant retinue of the secular and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> princes of the empire, for the twofold purpose of receiving the imperial crown and of restoring order in the Italian Peninsula. The condition of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in particular was deplorable. In St. Peter's, the Lateran, and St. Mary Major's, sat three rival claimants to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. (See B<font size=-2>ENEDICT</font> IX.) Two of them, <a href="../cathen/02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a> and Sylvester III, represented rival factions of the Roman nobility. The position of the third, <a href="../cathen/06791b.htm">Gregory VI</a>, was peculiar. The reform party, in order to free the city from the intolerable yoke of the House of Tusculum, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from the stigma of Benedict's dissolute life, had stipulated with that stripling that he should resign the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a> upon receipt of a certain amount of money. That this heroic measure for delivering the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> from destruction was <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a>, has been <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> by many; but that it bore the outward aspect of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and would be considered a flaw in <a href="../cathen/06791a.htm">Gregory's</a> title, consequently in the imperial title Henry was seeking, was the opinion of that age.

<p>Strong in the consciousness of his good intentions, <a href="../cathen/06791a.htm">Gregory</a> met King Henry at <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, and was received with all possible honours. It was decided that he should summon a synod to meet at Sutri near <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, at which the entire question should be ventilated. The proceedings of the Synod of Sutri, 20 December, are well summarized by <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a> in his "Essays Critical and Historical" (II, 262 sqq.). Of the three <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> claimants, Benedict refused to appear; he was again summoned and afterwards pronounced deposed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Sylvester was "stripped of his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> rank and shut up in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>". <a href="../cathen/06791a.htm">Gregory</a> showed himself to be, if not an <em>idiota,</em> at least a man <em>mir&aelig; simplicitatis,</em> by explaining in straightforward speech his compact with Benedict, and he made no other defence than his good intentions, and deposed himself (Watterich, Vit&aelig; Rom. Pont., I, 76); an act by some interpreted as a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> resignation, by others (Hefele), in keeping with the contemporary annals, as a deposition by the synod. The Synod of Sutri adjourned to meet again in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 23 and 24 December. Benedict, failing to appear, was condemned and deposed <em>in contumaciam,</em> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chair was declared vacant. As King Henry was not yet <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor, he had no canonical right to take part in the new election; but the Romans had no candidate to propose and begged the monarch to suggest a worthy subject.

<p>Henry's first choice, the powerful Adalbert, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, positively refused to accept the burden and suggested his friend Suidger, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>. In spite of the latter's protests, the king took him by the hand and presented him to the acclaiming <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people as their spiritual chief. Suidger's reluctance was finally overcome, though he insisted upon retaining the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of his beloved see. He might be pardoned for fearing that the turbulent Romans would ere long send him back to Bamberg. Moreover, since the king refused to give back to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> its possessions usurped by the nobles and the Normans, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was forced to look to his German <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> for financial support. He was <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> in St. Peter's on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a> and took the name of Clement II. He was born in Saxony of noble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parentage</a>, was first a canon in Halberstadt, then <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> at the court of King Henry, who on the death of Eberhard, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, appointed him to that important see. He was a man of strictest integrity and severe morality. His first pontifical act was to place the imperial crown upon his benefactor and the queen-consort, Agnes of Aquitaine. The new emperor received from the Romans and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the title and diadem of a Roman <em>Patricius,</em> a dignity which, since the tenth century, owing to the uncanonical pretensions of the Roman aristocracy, was commonly supposed to give the bearer the right of appointing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, or, more exactly speaking, of indicating the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to be chosen (Hefele). Had not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> given His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the inalienable right of freedom and independence, and sent her champions determined to enforce this right, she would now have simply exchanged the tyrrany of Roman factions for the more serious thraldom to a foreign power. The fact that Henry had protected the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and rescued her from her enemies gave him no just claim to become her lord and master. Short-sighted reformers, even men like <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damiani</a> (Opusc., VI, 36) who saw in this surrender of the freedom of papal elections to the arbitrary will of the emperor the opening of a new era, lived long enough to regret the mistake that was made. With due recognition of the prominent part taken by the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> in the reformation of the eleventh century, we cannot forget that neither Henry III nor his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> understood the importance of absolute independence in the election of the officers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This lesson was taught them by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a>, the young <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> of <a href="../cathen/06791b.htm">Gregory VI</a>, whom they took to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> with his master, only to return with <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">St. Leo IX</a> to begin his <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> career. Henry III, the sworn enemy of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, never took a penny from any of his appointees, but he claimed a right of appointment which virtually made him head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and paved the way for intolerable abuses under his unworthy successors.

<p>Clement lost no time in beginning the work of reform. At a great synod in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, January, 1047, the buying and selling of things spiritual was punished with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>; anyone who should knowingly accept <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> at the hands of a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> guilty of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> was ordered to do canonical penance for forty days. A dispute for precedence between the Sees of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and Aquileia was settled in favour of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of which was, in the absence of the emperor, to take his station at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> right. Clement accompanied the emperor in a triumphal progress through Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and placed <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> under an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> for refusing to open its gates to them. Proceeding with Henry to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, he <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> Wiborada, a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> of St. Gall, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by the Huns in 925. On his way back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he died bear <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a>. That he was poisoned by the partisans of <a href="../cathen/02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a> is a mere suspicion without <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. He bequeathed his mortal remains to <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, in the great <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of which his marble sarcophagus is to be seen at the present day. He is the only <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> buried in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, notably the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Li&#232;ge, now exerted themselves to reseat in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chair <a href="../cathen/06791b.htm">Gregory VI</a>, whom, together with his <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, Henry held in honourable custody; but the emperor unceremoniously appointed Poppo, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02793d.htm">Brixen</a>, who took the name of Damasus II. (See <a href="../cathen/06791a.htm">G<font size=-2>REGORY</font> VI</a>; B<font size=-2>ENEDICT</font> IX.)
