<h1>Pope Clement III</h1>  

<p>(Paolo Scolari).

<p>Date of birth unknown; elected 19 December, 1187; d. 27 March, 1191. During the short space (1181-1198) which separated the glorious pontificates of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> and <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, no less than five pontiffs occupied in rapid succession the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chair. They were all veterans trained in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander</a>, and needed only their earlier youthful vigour and length of reign to gain lasting renown in an age of great events. <a href="../cathen/06795a.htm">Gregory VIII</a>, after a pontificate of two months, died on 17 December, 1187, at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, whither he had gone to expedite the preparations for the recovery of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; he was succeeded two days later by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina</a>, Paolo Scolari, a Roman by birth. The choice was particularly acceptable to the Romans; for he was the first native of their city who was elevated to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> since their rebellion in the days of <a href="../cathen/01747b.htm">Arnold of Brescia</a>, and his well-known mildness and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of peace turned their thoughts towards a reconciliation, more <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to them than to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Overtures led to the conclusion of a formal treaty, by which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sovereignty and the municipal liberties were equally secured; and in the following February Clement made his entry into the city amid the boundless enthusiasm of a population which never seemed to have learned the art of living either with or without the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>Seated in the Lateran, Pope Clement turned his attention to the gigantic task of massing the forces of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. He was the organizer of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section3">Third Crusade</a>; and if that imposing expedition produced insignificant results, the blame nowise attaches to him. He dispatched <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to the different courts, who laboured to restore harmony among the belligerent monarchs and princes, and to divert their energy towards the reconquest of the Holy Sepulchre. Fired by the example of the <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Emperor Barbarossa</a> and of the Kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, a countless host of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> warriors took the road which led them to Palestine and death. At the time of Clement's death, just before the capture of Acre, the prospects, notwithstanding the drowning of <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> and the return of <a href="../cathen/12001a.htm">Philip Augustus</a>, still seemed bright enough.

<p>The death of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> chief vassal, William II of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, precipitated another unfortunate quarrel between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the Hohenstaufen. Henry VI, the son and successor of <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a>, claimed the kingdom by right of his wife Constanza, the only legitimate survivor of the House of Roger. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, whose independence was at an end, if the empire and the Two Sicilies were held by the same monarch, as well as the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> who detested the rule of a foreigner, determined upon resistance, and when the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilians</a> proclaimed Tancred of <a href="../cathen/09107d.htm">Lecce</a>, a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> but <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> scion of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Roger, as king, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> gave him the investiture. Henry advanced into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> with a strong army to enforce his claim; an opportune death reserved the continuation of the contest to Clement's successor, <a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Celestine III</a>. By a wise moderation Clement succeeded in quieting the disturbances caused by contested elections in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and St. Andrews in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. He also delivered the Scottish Church from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of York and declared it directly subject to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Clement <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> Otto of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/12225a.htm">Pomerania</a> (d. 1139), and Stephen of Thiers in Auvergne, founder of the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">Hermits</a> of Grammont (d. 1124).
