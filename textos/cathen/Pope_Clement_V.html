<h1>Pope Clement V</h1>  

<p>(B<font size=-2>ERTRAND DE</font> G<font size=-2>OT</font>.)

<p>Born at Villandraut in Gascony, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 1264; died at Roquemaure, 20 April, 1314. He was elected, 5 June, 1305, at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> as successor to <a href="../cathen/02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a>, after a <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of eleven months, the great length of which was owing to the French and Italian factions among the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. Ten of the fifteen (mostly Italian) <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> voting elected him. Giovanni Villani's story (Hist. Florent., VIII, 80, in Muratori, SS. RR. Ital., XIII, 417; cf. Raynald, Ann. Eccl., 1305, 2-4) of a decisive influence of <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>, and the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> secret conference with and abject concessions to that king in the forest of Saint-Jean-d'Ang&eacute;ly, is quite unhistorical; on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> were willing to please the powerful French king whom the late <a href="../cathen/02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a> had been <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to placate by notable concessions, and it is not improbable that some kind of a mutual understanding was reached by the king and the future <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. As <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, Bertrand de Got was actually a subject of the King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but from early youth he had been a personal friend of <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a>. Nevertheless, he had remained faithful to <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> came from a distinguished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. An elder brother had been <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and died (1297) as <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01255b.htm">Albano</a> and <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Bertrand studied the arts at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> at Orl&eacute;ans and Bologna. He had been successively canon at <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> (his aforesaid brother), <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Comminges under <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, and eventually <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, then a difficult office because of the persistent conflict between <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for the possession of Normandy. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> besought him to come to <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> and go thence to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for his <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>, but he ordered them to repair to <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, where he was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> (14 November, 1305) in presence of <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">Philip the Fair</a> and with great pomp. During the usual public procession the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was thrown from his horse by a falling wall; one of his brothers was killed on that occasion, also the aged Cardinal Matteo Orsini who had taken part in twelve <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclaves</a> and seen thirteen <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. The most precious jewel in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a> (a carbuncle) was lost that day, an incident prophetically interpreted by German and Italian historians, and the next day another brother was slain in a quarrel between servants of the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and retainers of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. For some time (1305-1309), Pope Clement resided at different places in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (<a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>), but finally took up his residence at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, then a fief of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, though within the County of Venaissin that since 1228 acknowledged the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as overlord (in 1348 <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> purchased <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> for 80,000 gold gulden from Joanna of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>). Strong affection for his native <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and an equally influential fear of the quasi-anarchical conditions of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and in particular of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a> and the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, led him to this fateful decision, whereby he exposed himself to the domination of a civil ruler (Philip the Fair), whose immediate aims were a universal French monarchy and a solemn humiliation of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Pope Boniface VIII</a> in return for the latter's <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> resistance to Philip's cunning, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and usurpations (Hergenr&ouml;ther).
<h2>States of the Church</h2>

<p>The government of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a> was committed by Clement to a commission of three <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, while at <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> his own brother, Arnaud Garsias de Got, held the office of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> vicar. Giacomo degli Stefaneschi, a senator and popular chief, governed within the city in a loose and personal way. Confusion and <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a> were prevalent, owing to the implacable mutual <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the Colonna and Orsini, the traditional turbulence of the Romans, and the frequent angry conflicts between the people and the nobles, conditions which had been growing worse all through the thirteenth century and had eventually driven even the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> to such outside strongholds as <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, <a href="../cathen/01448a.htm">Anagni</a>, <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>. No more graphic illustration of the local conditions at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Patrimony of Peter</a> could be asked than the description of Nicholas of Butrinto, the historiographer of Emperor Henry VII, on his fateful Roman expedition of 1312 [see Von Raumont, Geschichte der Stadt Rom, <a href="../cathen/02493b.htm">Berlin</a>, 1867, II (1), 745-65]. Among the untoward Roman events of Pope Clement's reign was the conflagration 6 May, 1308, that destroyed the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John Lateran, soon rebuilt, however, by the Romans with the aid of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Clement did not hesitate to try the conclusions of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Italian state of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> that had <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> seized on <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, a fief of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Patrimony of Peter</a>. When <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, and a general prohibition of all commercial intercourse failed, he outlawed the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>, and caused a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> to be preached against them; finally his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, Cardinal P&eacute;lagrue, overthrew in a terrific battle the haughty aggressors (28 August, 1309). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> vicariate of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> was then conferred on Robert of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, whose Catalonian mercenaries, however, were more odious to the people than the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> usurpers. In any case, the smaller powers of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> had learned that they could not yet strip with impunity the inheritance of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, and an example was furnished which the greatest soldier of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, Gil d'Albornoz (q.v.), would better before the century was over.


<h2>Process of Boniface VIII</h2>

<p>Almost at once King Philip demanded from the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a formal condemnation of the memory of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>; only thus could the royal hate be placated. The king wished the name of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface</a> stricken from the list of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, his bones disinterred, burned, and the ashes scattered to the winds. This odious and disgraceful step Clement sought to avert, partly by delay, partly by new favours to the king; he renewed the <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> granted the king by <a href="../cathen/02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a>, created nine <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> out of a group of ten, restored to the Colonna <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> their places in the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, and accorded the king titles of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> for five years. Finally, he withdrew the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Clericis Laicos", though not the earlier legislation on which it was based, and declared that the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Unam Sanctam" affected in no disadvantageous manner the meritorious French king, and implied for him and his kingdom no greater degree of subjection to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">papal see</a> than formerly existed. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was also helpful to Charles of Valois, the king's brother, and pretender to the imperial throne of Constantinople, by granting him a two years' <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> of church revenues; Clement hoped that a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> operating from a reconquered Constantinople would be successful. In May, 1307, at <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>, where peace was made between <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Philip again insisted on a canonical process for condemnation of the memory of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, a blasphemer, an immoral <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, etc. Eventually, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> made answer that so grave a matter could not be settled outside of a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>, and the king for a while seemed satisfied with this solution. Nevertheless, he returned frequently and urgently to his proposition. It was in vain that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> exhibited a willingness to sacrifice the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> (see below); the merciless king, sure of his power, pressed for the opening of this unique trial, unheard of since the time of Pope Formosus. Clement had to yield, and designated 2 February, 1309, as the date, and <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> as the place for the trial of his dead predecessor on the shameful charges so long colported about <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> by the Colonna <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and their faction. In the document (citation) that called (13 September, 1309) for the witnesses, Clement expressed his personal conviction of the innocence of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface</a>, at the same time his resolution to satisfy the king. Though the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had soon (2 February, 1310) to protest against a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> interpretation of his own words, the process was really begun in a consistory of 16 March, 1310, at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. Much delay followed, on one side and the other, apropos chiefly of methods of procedure. Early in 1311, witnesses were examined outside of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but by French commissaries and mostly on the above-mentioned charges of the Colonna (see <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">BONIFACE VIII</a>). Finally, in February, 1311, the king wrote to Clement abandoning the process to the future council (of Vienne) or to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> own action, and promising to cause the withdrawal of the charges; at the same time he protested that his intentions had been pure. One price of these welcome concessions was a formal declaration by Pope Clement (27 April, 1311) of the king's innocence and that of his friends; these representatives of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the "Israel of the New Alliance", had acted, said the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> and with a pure <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, nor should they fear in the future any canonical detriment from the events of <a href="../cathen/01448a.htm">Anagni</a>. <a href="../cathen/11089a.htm">William Nogaret</a> was excepted, but on his protestation of innocence, and at the intercession of Philip, a penance was imposed on him and he too received <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. Only those who detained <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> were finally excluded from pardon. The religious <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Philip was again acknowledged; all <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> acts detrimental to him and his kingdom since November, 1302, were rescinded; the erasures are yet visible in the "Regesta" of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, in the Vatican Archives (see <a href="../cathen/14788c.htm">Tosti</a>, "Storia di Bonifazio VIII", Rome, 1886, II, 343-44). This painful situation was closed for Clement V by the Council of Vienne (16 October, 1311), most of whose members were personally favourable to <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface</a>. It is not certain that the council took up formally the question of the guilt or innocence of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface</a>. In their present shape the official Acts of the council are silent, nor do all contemporary writers mention it as a fact. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that Giovanni Villani describes Philip and his counsellors as urgent for the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface</a> by the council, but, he says, the memory of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was formally purged from all adverse charges by three <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and several jurists; moreover, three Catalonian <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> offered to defend with their swords the good name of the Gaetani <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> against all comers, whereupon the king yielded, and demanded only that he be declared guiltless of any responsibility for the turn affairs had taken. With the death of his personal enemies, opposition to <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface</a> diminished, and his legitimacy was no longer denied even in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (Balan, "Il processo di Bonifazio VIII", Rome, 1881).
<h2>Clement V and the Templars</h2>

<p>Since the final expulsion (1291) of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusading</a> forces from the Holy Land, the ecclesiastico-military orders in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> had aroused much adverse criticism, partly because to their jealousies (<a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a>, <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> or Knights of St. John, <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a>) was attributed the humiliating defeat, partly because of the vast wealth they had acquired in their short existence. The <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> (so-called from the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">Temple of Jerusalem</a>, <em>pauperes commilitones Christi Templique Solomonici,</em> i.e. poor fellow-soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon) were the richest. Their fortress-like <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, known as Temples, arose in every <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> land, and by the end of the thirteenth century sheltered the chief banking-system of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> were trusted by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and kings and by <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of wealth because of their uprightness, the good management of their affairs, and their solid credit based on the countless estates of the order and its widespread financial relations. Already before the accession of Pope Clement, their status was growing perilous; apart from the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> aroused by their riches, accusations of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, exclusiveness, usurpation of episcopal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, etc. were raised against them. They had resisted several attempts to unite their order with the <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a>, and while it is no longer easy to fix the degree of their popularity with the common people, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that in many quarters of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> they had aroused the cupidity of princes and the jealousy of many higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, especially in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>; without the co-operation of the latter they could never have fallen in so tragic a manner. Their story is told in full in the article <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">T<font size=-2>EMPLARS</font></a>; hence, to avoid repetition, it will suffice to mention here the principal facts. In the first year of the pontificate of Clement V the French king began to demand from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the suppression of this <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order and to set afoot a campaign of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> such as had so far succeeded in the case of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>. If the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, as was naturally to be feared, refused finally to yield in the matter of the process against his predecessor's memory, he would surely be glad to buy relief with the sacrifice of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a>. Owing to the weakness and irresolution of Pope Clement, the royal plan succeeded. After an unsuccessful attempt of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (in August, 1307) to unite the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a>, he yielded to the demands of King Philip and ordered an investigation of the order, against which the king brought charges of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> (renunciation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, immorality, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, contempt of the Mass, denial of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, etc.). Philip, however, did not wait for the ordinary operation of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, but, with the aid of his confessor, Guillaume de Paris (the inquisitor of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>), and his clever, unscrupulous jurists (<a href="../cathen/11089a.htm">Nogaret</a>, de Plaisians, Enguerrand de Marigny) struck suddenly at the whole order, 12 October, 1307, by the arrest at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> of Jacques de Molay, the Grand Commander, and one hundred and forty <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a>, followed by the inquisitor's mandate to arrest all other members throughout <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and by royal sequestration of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the order. Public opinion was cunningly and successfully forestalled by the aforesaid jurists. It was also falsely made to appear that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> approved, or was consentingly aware, of the royal action, while the co-operation of French inquisitors and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> put the seal of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> approval on an act that was certainly so far one of gross <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>.

<p>While Philip invited the other princes of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to follow his example, Clement V protested (27 October) against the royal usurpation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority, demanded the transfer to his own custody of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> and their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and suspended the inquisitional authority of the king's ecclesiastic and the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Philip made an apparent submission, but in the meantime Clement had issued another <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> (22 November) commanding an investigation of the anti-Templar charges in all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> countries. (It may be said at once that the results were generally favourable to the order; nowhere, given the lack of torture, were confessions obtrained like those secured in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.) The feeble efforts of Clement to obtain for the order strict canonical <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> (he was himself an excellent canonist) were counteracted by the new <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> that dignified and seemed to confirm the charges of the French king, neither then nor later supported by any material evidence or documents outside of his own suborned witnesses and the confessions of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, obtained by torture or by other dubious methods of their jailers, none of whom dared resist the well-known will of Philip. The alleged secret Rule of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a>, authorizing the aforesaid charges, was never produced. In the meantime <a href="../cathen/11089a.htm">William Nogaret</a> had been busy defaming Pope Clement, threatening him with charges not unlike those pending against <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, and working up successfully an anti-Templar public opinion against the next meeting (May, 1308) of the States-General. In July of that year it was agreed between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the king that the guilt or innocence of the order itself should be separated from that of its individual (French) members. The former was reserved to a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>, soon to be convoked at Vienne in Southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and to prepare evidence for which, apart from the examinations now going on through <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and a hearing before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of seventy-two members of the order brought from the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> of Philip (all of whom confessed themselves guilty of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>), there were appointed various special commissions, the most important of which began its sessions at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in August, 1309. Its members, acting in the name and with the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, were opposed to the use of torture, hence before them hundreds of <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> maintained freely the innocence of the order, while many of those who had formerly yielded to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> inquisitors now retracted their avowals as contrary to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. When <a href="../cathen/11089a.htm">Nogaret</a> and de Plaisians saw the probable outcome of the hearings before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> commissions, they precipitated matters, caused the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> (brother of Enguerrand de Marigny) to call a provincial council (Sens was then <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and seat of the local inquisition tribunal), at which were condemned, as relapsed <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, fifty-four <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> who had recently withdrawn before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> commissioners their former confessions on the plea that they had been given under torture and were quite <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. That same day (12 May, 1310), all these <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> were publicly burned at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> outside the Porte St. Antoine. To the end all protested their innocence.

<p>There could no longer be any question of liberty of defence; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> commission at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> suspended its sessions for six months, and when it met again found before it only <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> who had confessed the crimes they were charged with and had been reconciled by the local inquisitors. The fate of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> was finally sealed at the Council of Vienne (opened 16 October, 1311). The majority of its three hundred members were opposed to the abolition of the order, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> the alleged crimes unproven, but the king was urgent, appeared in person at the council, and finally obtained from Clement V the practical execution of his will. At the second session of the council, in presence of the king and his three sons, was read the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Vox in excelsis", <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 22 March, 1312, in which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> said that though he had no sufficient reasons for a formal condemnation of the order, nevertheless, because of the common weal, the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> borne them by the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> nature of their trial, and the probable dilapidation of the order's <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> land, he suppressed it by virtue of his sovereign power, and not by any definitive sentence. By another <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 2 May he vested in the <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> the title to the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the suppressed order. In one way or another, however, Philip managed to become the chief legatee of its great wealth in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. As to the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> themselves, those who continued to maintain their confessions were set free; those who withdrew them were considered relapsed <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and were dealt with as such by the tribunals of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>. It was only in 1314 that the Grand Master, Jacques de Molay and Geoffroy de Charnay, Grand Preceptor of Normandy, reserved to the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, were condemned to perpetual <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>. Thereupon they proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsity</a> of their confessions, and accused themselves of cowardice in betraying their order to save their lives. They were at once declared relapsed <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, turned over to the secular arm by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, and were burned that same day (18 March, 1314). Of Pope Clement it may be said that the few measures of equity that appear in the course of this great crime were owing to him; unfortunately his sense of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and his respect for the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> were counterbalanced by a weak and vacillating character, to which perhaps his feeble and uncertain health contributed. Some think he was convinced of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars'</a> guilt, especially after so many of the chief members had admitted it to himself; they explain thus his recommendation of the use of torture, also his toleration of the king's suppression of all proper liberty of defence on the part of the accused. Others believe that he feared for himself the fate of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, whose cruel enemy, <a href="../cathen/11089a.htm">William Nogaret</a>, still lived, attorney-general of Philip, skilled in legal <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and emboldened by a long career of successful <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>. His strongest motive was, in all probability, anxiety to save the memory of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of a formal condemnation which the malice of <a href="../cathen/11089a.htm">Nogaret</a> and the cold vindictiveness of Philip would have insisted on, had not the rich prey of the Temple been thrown to them; to stand for both with Apostolic <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> might have meant intolerable consequences, not only personal indignities, but in the end the graver <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> under conditions peculiarly unfavourable for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. (See P<font size=-2>HILIP THE</font> F<font size=-2>AIR</font>; V<font size=-2>IENNE,</font> C<font size=-2>OUNCIL OF</font>; <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">T<font size=-2>EMPLARS</font></a>.)
<h2>Clement V and Emperor Henry Vii</h2>

<p>In pursuance of the vast ambitions of the French monarchy (Pierre Dubois, "De recuperatione terr&aelig; sanct&aelig;", ed. Langlois, Paris, 1891), King Philip was anxious to see his brother Charles of Valois chosen King of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in succession tot he <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> Adolph of Nassau, of course with a view of obtaining later the imperial crown. Pope Clement was apparently active in favour of Philip's plan; at the same time he made it known to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> electors that the selection of Count Henry of L&uuml;tzelburg, brother of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, would be pleasing to him. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was well aware that further extension of French authority could only reduce still more his own small measure of independence. Though elected, 6 January, 1309, as Henry VII, and soon assured of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> agreement to his imperial <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, it was only in 1312 that the new king reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> emperor in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. John Lateran by <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> specially delegated by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Circumstances forced Henry VII to side with the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibellines</a>, with the result that in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself he found a powerful <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> party in possession of St. Peter's and the greater part of the city, actively supported also by King Robert of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. The new emperor, after the humiliating failure of his Italian expedition, undertook to compel the Angevin king to recognize the imperial authority, but was crossed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> action in defence of King Robert as a vassal of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, overlord of the Two Sicilies. On the eve of a new Italian campaign in support of the imperial <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> Henry VII died suddenly near <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, 24 August, 1313. He was the last hope of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> and his fellow-Ghibellines, for whom at this time the great poet drew up in the "De Monarchi&#226;" his ideal of good government in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> through the restoration of the earlier strong empire of German rulers, in whom he saw the ideal overlords of the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> world, and even of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as a temporal prince.
<h2>Clement V and England</h2>

<p>Ambassadors of Edward I assisted at the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Clement V. At the request of King Edward, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> freed him from the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of keeping the promises added to the Charter in 1297 and 1300, though the king afterwards took little or no advantage of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. Moreover, to satisfy the king, he suspended and called to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court (1305) the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, Robert of Winchelsea, who had previously suffered much for adhering to the side of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, and whom Edward I was now pursuing with unproved charges of treason. (See <a href="../cathen/04050b.htm">C<font size=-2 >LERICIS</font> L<font size=-2>AICOS</font></a>.) It was only in 1307, after the accession of Edward II, that this great churchman, at the royal request, was permitted by Clement to return from <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> to his See of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, whose ancient right to crown the kings of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> he successfully maintained. Clement <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> (1306) Robert Bruce of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> for his share in the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of the Red Comyn, and he deprived of their sees Bishops Lambarton and Wishart for their part in the subsequent national rising of the Scots. The Lords and Commons at the Parliament of <a href="../cathen/03349b.htm">Carlisle</a> (1307) exhibited a strong anti-papal temper, apropos, among other complaints, of the granting of rich <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> to foreigners, and though no positive action followed, the later Statutes of Provisors and Pr&aelig;munire look back to this event as indicative of English temper. (See Gasquet, "The Eve of the Reformation", essay on "Mixed Jurisdiction", and for other items of English interest the "Regesta" of Clement V, and Bliss, "Calendar of Ecclesiastical Documents relating to England", London, 1893 sqq., Rolls series.)
<h2>Clement V and the canon law</h2>

<p>He completed the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> "Corpus Juris Canonici" by the publication of a collection of <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a> known as "Clementine&aelig;", or "Liber Clementinarum", sometimes "Liber Septimus" in reference to the "Liber Sextus" of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>. It contains <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> of the latter <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, of <a href="../cathen/02429c.htm">Benedict XI</a>, and of Clement himself. Together with the decrees of the Council of Vienne it was <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> (21 March, 1314) at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> residence of Monteaux near Carpentras. It follows the method of the "Decretals" of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> and the "Liber Sextus" of <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>, i.e. five books with subdivision into titles and chapters. As the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> died (20 April) before this collection had been generally published, its authenticity was <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> by some, wherefore <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> it anew, 25 October, 1317, and sent it to the <a href="../cathen/02641b.htm">University of Bologna</a> as a genuine collection of <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a> to be used in the courts and the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. (Laurin, "Introd. in corpus juris canonici", Freiburg, 1889; cf. Ehrle, "Archiv f. Litteratur und Kirchengesch.", IV, 36 sqq.)
