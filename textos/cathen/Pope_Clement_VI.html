<h1>Pope Clement VI</h1>  

<p>(P<font size=-2>IERRE</font> R<font size=-2>OGER</font>)

<p>Born 1291 in the castle of Maumont, department of Corr&#232;ze, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, 7 May, 1342, at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, where he died 6 December, 1352. At the age of ten he entered the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of La Chaise-Dieu (Haute- Loire), where he made his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>. After devoting some time to study at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, he graduated as doctor and became professor in that city. Subsequent to his introduction to <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> by Cardinal Pierre Grouin de Mortemart, he rapidly rose from one <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignity</a> to another. At first <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">prior</a> of Saint-Baudile at <a href="../cathen/11083a.htm">N&icirc;mes</a>, then <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of F&eacute;camp in <a href="../cathen/11104a.htm">Normandy</a>, he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a> and Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1328, was promoted to the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> in 1329, and to that of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> the following year. In the latter city a provincial council, which <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> several disciplinary decrees, was held under his presidency in 1335. He was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> (1338) by <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a>, whom he succeeded as pontiff. One of the characteristic traits of his policy as head of the Universal Church was his excessive devotion to the interests of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and those of his relatives. His French sympathies impeded his efforts to restore and maintain peace between <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, although his mediation led to the conclusion of a short general truce (Malestroit, 1343). Most of the twenty-five <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> whom he created were French, and twelve of them were related to him. The King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was given permission (1344) to Communicate under both kinds. Clement accepted the senatorial dignity offered him as "Knight Roger" by a Roman delegation, which numbered <a href="../cathen/11778a.htm">Petrarch</a> as one of its members. He also granted their request for the celebration of a jubilee every fifty, instead of every hundred, years (<a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>, 1343), but declined their invitation to return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Greater permanency seemed to be assured to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> residence abroad by his purchase of the sovereignty of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> for 80,000 florins from Joanna of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and Provence (9 June, 1348). About the same time he also declared this princess innocent of complicity in the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of her husband. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> success in Roman affairs is evidenced by his confirmation of the ephemeral but then unavoidable rule of Cola di Rienzi (20 May to 15 Dec., 1347). His later condemnation of this arrogant tribune was largely instrumental in bringing about his fall from power. Shortly after these events the jubilee year of 1350 brought an extraordinarily large number of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>. In his attempt to strengthen the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> party in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> met with failure, and was constrained to cede the city of Bologna to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> for a period of twelve years.

<p>Clement took up with ardour the long-standing conflict between the Emperor Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. The former had offended the religious feelings of many of his adherents by arbitrarily annulling the marriage of Marguerite Maultasch, heiress of Tyrol, and John Henry, Prince of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>. The popular discontent was still further intensified when the emperor authorized his own son to marry the same princess. Louis consequently was ready to make the greatest concessions to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In a writing of September, 1343, he acknowledged his unlawful assumption of the imperial title, declared his willingness to annul all his imperial acts and to submit to any <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> penalty, but at the same time wished to be recognized as King of the Romans. Clement demanded as further conditions that no law should be enacted in the empire without <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sanction, that the binding force of Louis's <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> royal decrees should be suspended until confirmation by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, that he should depose all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> named by himself, and waive all claim to the sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>. Louis submitted the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> demands to the consideration of the German princes, at a time when anti-papal feeling ran very high in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, as a result of the separation of the Archbishopric of Prague from the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> (30 April, 1344). The princes declared them unacceptable, but also spoke of the necessity of electing a new king in place of Louis, whose rule had been so disastrous to the empire. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on 7 April, 1346, deposed Henry of Virneburg, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and an ardent partisan of the reigning emperor, and named the twenty-year-old Gerlach of Nassau to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. On 13 April of the same year he launched a severe <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> against the emperor, in which he requested the electors to give him a successor. Charles of Luxemburg, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> candidate and former pupil, was elected King of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (11 July, 1346), by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, John of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, by Rudolf of Saxony, and the three <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> electors. Charles IV (1346- 78) substantially accepted the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> demands, but his authority was not immediately recognized throughout <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. The country was on the verge of civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, when Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> suddenly died while engaged in a boar-hunt near <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> (11 October, 1347). The opposition of G&uuml;nther of Schwartzenburg (d. 14 June, 1349) to Charles was but of short duration. Left without a protector, through the death of Louis, <a href="../cathen/15636a.htm">William of Occam</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> now made their submission to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. About 1344 Clement VI granted the sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/03243a.htm">Canary Islands</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> Prince Louis de la Cerda, on condition that no other <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ruler had acquired any right to their possession. The new sovereign, who was accorded the title of Prince of Fortunia, agreed to introduce <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> into the islands and to pay tribute to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. He could not, however, take effective possession of the territory, which was not permanently converted at this time, even though a special <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Bernard) was named for the islands in 1351. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> attempts to reunite the Greeks and <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> led to no definite results. The East desired not so much a return to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> unity as assistance against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. A <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the latter, which was undertaken in 1344, ended in a barren truce.

<p>More of a temporal prince than an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ruler, Clement was munificent to profusion, a patron of arts and letters, a lover of good cheer, well-appointed banquets and brilliant receptions, to which ladies were freely admitted. The heavy expenses necessitated by such pomp soon exhausted the funds which the economy of <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a> had provided for his successor. To open up new sources of revenue, in the absence of the ordinary income from the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>, fresh taxes were imposed and an ever-increasing number of appointments to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> was reserved to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Such arbitrary proceedings led to resistance in several countries. In 1343 the agents of two <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, whom Clement had appointed to offices in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, were driven from that country. <a href="../cathen/05321a.htm">Edward III</a> vehemently complained of the exactions of the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> Court, and in 1351 was passed the Statute of Provisors, according to which the king reserved the <a href="../cathen/12399a.htm">right of presentation</a> in all cases of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> appointments to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. The memory of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is clouded by his open French partisanship and by the gross nepotism of his reign. Clement VI was nevertheless a protector of the oppressed and a helper of the needy. His <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and charity strikingly appeared at the time of the Great Pestilence, or Black Death, at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> (1348-49). While in many places, numerous <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were massacred by the populace as being the cause of the pestilence, Clement issued <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> for their protection and afforded them a refuge in his little State. He <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="../cathen/08256b.htm">St. Ivo</a> of Tr&eacute;guier, Brittany (d. 1303), the advocate of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> (June, 1347), condemned the <a href="../cathen/06089c.htm">Flagellants</a>, and in 1351 <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a> defended the Mendicant <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> against the accusations of some secular <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. Several sermons have been preserved of this admittedly learned <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and eloquent speaker. He died after a short illness, and, according to his desire, was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> at La Chaise-Dieu. In 1562 his grave was <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecrated</a> and his remains burned by some <a href="../cathen/07527b.htm">Huguenots</a>.
