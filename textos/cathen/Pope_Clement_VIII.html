<h1>Pope Clement VIII</h1>  

<p>(IPPOLITO ALDOBRANDINI).

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/05785a.htm">Fano</a>, March, 1536, of a distinguished Florentine <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 5 March, 1605. He was elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> 30 January, 1592, after a stormy <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> graphically described by Ranke (Geschichte der r&ouml;mischen P&auml;pste, 9th ed., II, 150 sqq.). In his youth he made excellent progress in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> under the direction of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, an able jurist. Through the stages of consistorial advocate, auditor of the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a> and the Datary, he was advanced in 1585 to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of the Title of St. Pancratius and was made grand penitentiary. He won the friendship of the Hapsburgs by his successful efforts, during a legation to <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, to obtain the release of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> Archduke Maximilian, the defeated claimant to the Polish throne. During the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1592 he was the unwilling candidate of the compact minority of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who were determined to deliver the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> from the prepotency of <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a>. His election was greeted with boundless enthusiasm by the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> and by all who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> his character. He possessed all the qualifications needed in the Vicar of Christ. Blameless in <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> from childhood, he had at an early period placed himself under the direction of <a href="../cathen/12018b.htm">St. Philip Neri</a>, who for thirty years was his confessor. Upon Clement's elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, the aged saint gave over this important office to <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, notwithstanding his reluctance, created a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and to whom he made his confession every evening. The fervour with which he said his daily Mass filled all present with devotion. His long association with the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to imbibe the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> spirit so thoroughly, that in him St. Philip himself might be said to have ascended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chair. Though vast political problems clamoured for solution, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> first turned his attention to the more important spiritual interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He made a personal visitation of all the churches and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> and <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charitable institutions</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, everywhere eliminating abuses and enforcing discipline. To him we owe the institution of the <a href="../cathen/06151a.htm">Forty Hours' Devotion</a>. He founded at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the Collegio Clementino for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the sons of the richer classes, and augmented the number of national colleges in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by opening the Collegio Scozzese for the training of missionaries to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. The "Bullarium Romanum" contains many important constitutions of Clement, notably one denouncing <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duelling</a> and one providing for the inviolability of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>. He issued revised editions of the <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">Vulgate</a> (1598), the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, also the "C&aelig;remoniale", and the "Pontificale".

<p>The complicated situation in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> presented no insuperable difficulties to two consummate statesmen like <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a> and Clement VIII. It was clear to Henry that, notwithstanding his victories, he could not peacefully retain the French Crown without adopting the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. He <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> 25 July, 1593. It was equally clear to Pope Clement that it was his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> the selfish hostility of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> by acknowledging the legitimate claims of Henry, as soon as he convinced himself that the latter's conversion was something more than a political manoeuvre. In the autumn of 1595 he solemnly absolved Henry IV, thus putting an end to the thirty years' religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and winning a powerful ally in his struggle to achieve the independence of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Henry's friendship was of essential importance to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> two years later, when Alfonso II, Duke of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, died childless (27 Oct., 1597), and Pope Clement resolved to bring the stronghold of the Este dynasty under the immediate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Though <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and the empire encouraged Alfonso's <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> cousin, Cesare d'Este, to withstand the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, they were deterred from giving him aid by Henry's threats, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> army entered <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> almost unopposed. In 1598 Pope Clement won still more credit for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> by bringing about a definite treaty of peace between <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the Treaty of Vervins and between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>. He also lent valuable assistance in men and money to the emperor in his contest with the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. He was as merciless as <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> in crushing out brigandage and in punishing the lawlessness of the Roman nobility. He did not even spare the youthful patricide Beatrice Cenci, over whom so many tears have been shed. (Bertolotti, Francesco Cenci e la sua famiglia, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 1879.) On 17 Feb., 1600, the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/03016a.htm">Giordano Bruno</a> was burned at the stake on the Piazza dei Fiori. The jubilee of 1600 was a brilliant witness to the glories of the renovated <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, three million <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> visiting the holy places. In 1595 was held the Synod of Brest, in <a href="../cathen/09292a.htm">Lithuania</a>, by which a great part of the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people were reunited to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Likowski, Union zu Brest, 1094). Although Clement, in spite of constant <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, was tortured with gout in feet and hands, his capacity for work was unlimited, and his powerful <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> grasped all the needs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> throughout the world. He entered personally into the minutest detail of every subject which came before him, e.g., in the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> between Henry IV and Margaret of Valois, yet more in the great controversy on grace between the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02247a.htm">BA&Ntilde;EZ</a>, <a href="../cathen/10436a.htm">MOLINA</a>). He was present at all the sessions of the <em>Congregatio de auxiliis</em> (q.v.), but wisely refrained from issuing a final <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on the question. Clement VIII died in his seventieth years after a pontificate of thirteen years. His remains repose in Santa Maria Maggiore, where the Borghesi, who succeed the Aldobrandini in the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> line, erected a gorgeous monument to his memory.
