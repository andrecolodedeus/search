<h1>Pope Clement X</h1>  

<p>(EMILIO ALTIERI).

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 13 July, 1590; elected 29 April, 1670, and died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 22 July, 1676. Unable to secure the election of any of the prominent candidates, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> finally, after a <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of four months and twenty days, resorted to the old expedient of electing a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> of advanced years; they united upon Cardinal Altieri, an octogenarian, whose long life had been spent in the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and whom <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">Clement IX</a>, on the eve of his death, had raised to the dignity of the purple. The reason a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> of such transcendent merits received the cardinalate so late in life seems to have been that he had waived his claims to the elevation in favour of an older brother. He protested vigorously against this use of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> robes as a funeral shroud, but at length was persuaded to accept, and out of gratitude to his benefactor, by ten years his junior, he assumed the name of Clement X. The Altieri belonged to the ancient Roman nobility, and since all but one of the male scions had chosen the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> career, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in order to save the name from extinction, adopted the Paoluzzi, one of whom he married to Laura Caterina Altieri, the sole heiress of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>.

<p>During previous pontificates the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had held important offices and had been entrusted with delicate missions. <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> gave him charge of the works designed to protect the territory of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> from the unruly Po. <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>; and he is credited with no slight share in the re-establishment of peace after the stormy days of Masaniello. Under <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> he was made secretary of the Congregation of Bishops and Regulars. <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">Clement IX</a> named him superintendent of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> exchequer. On his accession to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, he gave to his new kinsman, Cardinal Paoluzzi-Altieri, the uncle of Laura's husband, the office of cardinal nephew, and with advancing years gradually entrusted to him the management of affairs, to such an extent that the biting Romans said he had reserved to himself only the episcopal functions of <em>benedicere et sanctificare</em>, resigning in favour of the cardinal the administrative <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <em>regere et gubernare</em>. Nevertheless, the <em>Bullarium Romanum</em> contains many evidences of his religious activity, among which may be mentioned the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of Sts. Cajetan, Philip Benitius, <a href="../cathen/06213a.htm">Francis Borgia</a>, Louis Bertrand, and <a href="../cathen/13192c.htm">Rose of Lima</a>; also the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pope Pius V</a>, <a href="../cathen/08480a.htm">John of the Cross</a>, and the Martyrs of Gorcum in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. He laboured to preserve the peace of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, menaced by the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, and began with that imperious monarch the long struggle concerning the <em>r&eacute;gale</em>, or revenues of vacant <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>. He supported the Poles with strong financial aid in their hard struggle with their <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> invaders. He decorated the bridge of Sant' Angelo with the ten <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in Carrara marble still to be seen there. To Clement we owe the two beautiful fountains which adorn the Piazza of St. Peter's church near the tribune, where a monument has been erected to his memory.
