<h1>Pope Clement XI</h1>  

<p>(GIOVANNI FRANCESCO ALBANI).

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, 23 July, 1649; elected 23 November, 1700; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 19 March, 1721. The <a href="../cathen/01255a.htm">Albani</a> were a noble Umbrian <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Under <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> the grandfather of the future <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had held for thirteen years the honourable office of Senator of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. An uncle, <a href="../cathen/01255a.htm">Annibale Albani</a>, was a distinguished scholar and was Prefect of the Vatican Library. Giovanni Francesco was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in his eleventh year to prosecute his studies at the Roman College. He made rapid progress and was known as an author at the age of eighteen, translating from the Greek into elegant Latin. He attracted the notice of the patroness of Roman <em>literati</em>, Queen Christina of Sweden, who before he became of age enrolled him in her exclusive <em>Accademia</em>. With equal ardour and success, he applied himself to the profounder branches, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and law, and was created doctor of canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. So brilliant an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, joined with stainless <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, secured for him a rapid advancement at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court. At the age of twenty-eight he was made a <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, and governed successively <a href="../cathen/13054a.htm">Rieti</a>, Sabina, and <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>, everywhere acceptable on account of his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Recalled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he was appointed Vicar of St. Peter's, and on the death of Cardinal Slusio succeeded to the important position of Secretary of <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Papal Briefs</a>, which he held for thirteen years, and for which his command of classical latinity singularly fitted him. On 13 February, 1690, he was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal-deacon</a> and later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of the Title of San Silvestro, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1700 would have terminated speedily with the election of Cardinal Mariscotti, had not the veto of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> rendered the choice of that able <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> impossible. After deliberating for forty-six days, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> united in selecting Cardinal Albani, whose virtues and ability overbalanced the objection that he was only fifty-one years old. Three days were spent in the effort to overcome his reluctance to accept a dignity the heavy burden of which none <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> better than the experienced curialist (<a href="../cathen/06349b.htm">Galland</a> in Hist. Jahrbuch, 1882, III, 208 sqq.). The period was critical for <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> Charles II, the last of the Spanish Hapsburgs, had died childless, leaving his vast dominions a prey to French and Austrian <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>. His will, making Philip of Anjou, grandson of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, sole heir to the Spanish Empire, was contested by the Emperor Leopold, who claimed <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> for his second son Charles. The late king, before making this will, had consulted <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Pope Innocent XII</a>, and Cardinal Albani had been one of the three <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to whom the pontiff had entrusted the case and who advised him to pronounce secretly in its favour. This was at the time unknown to the emperor, else <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> would have vetoed the election of Albani. The latter was finally persuaded that it was his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to obey the call from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>; on 30 November he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and on 8 December solemnly <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> in the Vatican. The enthusiasm with which his elevation was greeted throughout the world is the best evidence of his worth. Even <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> received the intelligence with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and the city of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> struck a medal in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. The sincere <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reformers greeted his accession as the death-knell of nepotism; for, though he had many relatives, it was known that he had instigated and written the severe condemnation of that abuse issued by his predecessor. As pontiff, he did not belie his principles. He bestowed the offices of his court upon the most worthy subjects and ordered his brother to keep at a distance and refrain from adopting any new title or interfering in matters of state. In the government of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>, Clement was a capable administrator. He provided diligently for the needs of his subjects, was extremely charitable to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, bettered the condition of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>, and secured food for the populace in time of scarcity. He won the good will of artists by prohibiting the exportation of ancient masterpieces, and of scientists by commissioning <a href="../cathen/02541a.htm">Bianchini</a> to lay down on the pavement of Sta Maria degli Angioli the meridian of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, known as the Clementina.

<p>His capacity for work was prodigious. He slept but little and ate so sparingly that a few pence per day sufficed for his table. Every day he confessed and celebrated <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>. He entered minutely into the details of every measure which came before him, and with his own hand prepared the numerous allocutions, Briefs, and constitutions afterwards collected and published. He also found time to preach his beautiful <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> and was frequently to be seen in the confessional. Though his powerful frame more than once sank under the weight of his labours and cares, he continued to keep rigorously the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and generally allowed himself but the shortest possible respite from his labours.

<p>In his efforts to establish peace among the powers of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and to uphold the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he met with scant success; for the eighteenth century was eminently the age of selfishness and infidelity. One of his first public acts was to protest against the assumption (1701) by the Elector of Brandenburg of the title of King of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> action, though often derided and misinterpreted, was natural enough, not only because the bestowal of royal titles had always been regarded as the privilege of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, but also because <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> belonged by ancient right to the ecclesiastico-military institute known as the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Order</a>. In the troubles excited by the rivalry of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the Empire for the Spanish succession, Pope Clement resolved to maintain a neutral attitude; but this was found to be impossible. When, therefore, the Bourbon was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> in <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> as Philip V, amid the universal acclamations of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> acquiesced and acknowledged the validity of his title. This embittered the morose Emperor Leopold, and the relations between <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> became so strained that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did not conceal his satisfaction when the French and <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> troops began that march on <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> which ended so disastrously on the field of Blenheim. Marlborough's victory, followed by Prince Eugene's successful campaign in <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, placed <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> at the mercy of the Austrians. Leopold died in 1705 and was succeeded by his oldest son Joseph, a worthy precursor of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>. A contest immediately began on the question known as <em>Jus primarum precum</em>, involving the right of the crown to appoint to vacant <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. The victorious Austrians, now masters of Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, invaded the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, took possession of <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> and <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, annexed <a href="../cathen/04151a.htm">Comacchio</a> and besieged <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. Clement at first offered a spirited resistance, but, abandoned by all, could not hope for success, and when a strong detachment of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> troops under the command of the Prince of Hesse-Cassel reached Bologna, fearing a repetition of the fearful scenes of 1527, he finally gave way (15 Jan., 1709), acknowledged the Archduke Charles as King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> "without detriment to the rights of another", and promised him the investiture of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. Though the Bourbon monarchs had done nothing to aid the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in his unequal struggle, both Louis and Philip became very indignant and retaliated by every means in their power (see <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">LOUIS XIV</a>). In the negotiations preceding the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15245a.htm">Utrecht</a> (1713) the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> were studiously neglected; his <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> was not accorded a hearing; his dominions were parcelled out to suit the convenience of either party. <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> was given to Victor Amadeus II of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, with whom from the first days of his pontificate Clement was involved in quarrels on the subjects of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a> and appointments to vacant <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. The new king now undertook to revive the so-called <em><a href="../cathen/10451a.htm">Monarchia Sicula</a></em>, an ancient but much-disputed and abused privilege of pontifical origin which practically excluded the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> from any authority over the church in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>. When Clement answered with bann and <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, about 3000 in number, who remained loyal to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> were banished the island, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was forced to give them food and shelter. The <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> was not raised till 1718, when <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> regained possession, but the old controversy was repeatedly resumed under the Bourbons. Through the machinations of Cardinal Alberoni, <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> and <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> were granted to a Spanish Infante without regard to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> overlordship. It was some consolation to the much-tried <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> that Augustus of Saxony, King of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, returned to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Clement laboured hard to restore harmony in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, but without success. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> had taken advantage of the dissensions among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to invade <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> by land and sea. Clement proclaimed a jubilee, sent money and ships to the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>, and granted a <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> on all <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> to the Emperor Charles VI. When Prince Eugene won the great battle of Temesv&aacute;r, which put an end to the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> danger, no slight share of the credit was given by the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Holy Rosary</a>. Clement sent the great commander a blessed hat and sword. The fleet which Philip V of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> had raised at the instigation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and with subsidies levied on church revenues, was diverted by Alberoni to the conquest of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>; and though Clement showed his indignation by demanding the dismissal of the minister, and beginning a process against him, he had much to do to convince the emperor that he was not privy to the treacherous transaction. He gave a generous hospitality to the exiled son of James II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, James Edward Stuart, and helped him to obtain the hand of Clementina, <a href="../cathen/14061c.htm">John Sobieski's</a> accomplished granddaughter, mother of Charles Edward.

<p>Clement's pastoral vigilance was felt in every corner of the earth. He organized the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a> and sent missionaries to every distant spot. He erected <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> into a <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, 7 December, 1716. He enriched the Vatican Library with the <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> treasures gathered at the expense of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by Joseph Simeon Assemani in his researches throughout <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. In the unfortunate controversy between the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> concerning the permissibility of certain rites and customs, Clement decided in favour of the former. When the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> provoked a new collision with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> under the leadership of <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>, Pope Clement issued his two memorable Constitutions, "Vineam Domini", 16 July, 1705, and <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a>, 10 September, 1713 (see <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">UNIGENITUS</a>; <a href="../cathen/15445b.htm">VINEAM DOMINI</a>; <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">JANSENISM</a>). Clement XI made the feast of the Conception of the B.V.M. a Holy Day of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a>, <a href="../cathen/01472b.htm">Andrew of Avellino</a>, <a href="../cathen/06033a.htm">Felix of Cantalice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03446a.htm">Catherine of Bologna</a>.

<p>This great and saintly pontiff died appropriately on the feast of St. Joseph, for whom he entertained a particular devotion, and in whose <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> he composed the special Office found in the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>. His remains rest in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. His official acts, letters, and Briefs, also his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a>, were collected and published by his nephew, <a href="../cathen/01255a.htm">Cardinal Annibale Albani</a> (2 vols., Rome, 1722-24).
