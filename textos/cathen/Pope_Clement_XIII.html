<h1>Pope Clement XIII</h1>  

<p>(C<font size=-2>ARLO DELLA</font> T<font size=-2>ORRE</font> R<font size=-2 >EZZONICO</font>).

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 7 March, 1693; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 2 February, 1769. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at Bologna, took his degrees in law at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, and in 1716 was ppointed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> referendary of the two departments known as the "Signatura Justiti&aelig;" and the "Signatura Grati&aelig;". He was made governor of <a href="../cathen/13054a.htm">Rieti</a> in 1716, of <a href="../cathen/05785a.htm">Fano</a> in 1721, and Auditor of the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a> for <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 1725. In 1737 he was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal-deacon</a>, and in 1743 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, where he distinguished himself by his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the formation and sanctification of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, to promote which he held a synod in 1746, and published a very remarkable pastoral on the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> state. His personal life was in keeping with his teaching, and the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> Abb&eacute; Cl&eacute;ment, a grudging witness, tells us that "he was called the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> (by his people), and was an exemplary man who, notwithstanding the immense revenues of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and his private estate, was always without money owing to the lavishness of his alms-deeds, and would give away even his linen". In 1747 he became <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a>, and on 6 July, 1758, he was elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to succeed <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>. It was with tears that he submitted to the will of the electors, for he gauged well the force and direction of the storm which was gathering on the political horizon.

<p>Regalism and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> were the traditional enemies of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in its government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but a still more formidable foe was rising into power and using the other two as its instruments. This was the party of Voltaire and the <a href="../cathen/05418a.htm">Encyclopedists</a>, the "Philosophers" as they liked to call themselves. They were men of talent and highly <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, and by means of these gifts had drawn over to themselves many admirers and adherents from among the ruling classes, with the result that by the time of Clement XIII, they had their representatives in power in the Portugese and in all the five Bourbon Courts. Their enmity was radically against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> itself, as putting a restraint on their licence of thought and action. In their private correspondence they called it the <em>Inf&#226;me</em> (the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> one), and looked forward to its speedy extinction through the success of their policy; but they felt that in their relations with the public, and especially with the sovereigns, it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to feign some kind of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. In planning this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they were agreed that the first step must be the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. "When we have destroyed the Jesuits", wrote Voltaire to Helv&eacute;tius in 1761, "we shall have easy work with the <em>Inf&#226;me.</em>" And their method was to persuade the sovereigns that the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were the chief obstacle to their Regalist pretensions, and thereby a danger to the peace of their realms; and to support this view by the diffusion of defamatory literature, likewise by inviting the co-operation of those who, whilst blind to the character of their ulterior ends, stood with them for <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> or other reasons in their antipathy to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. Such was the political situation with which Clement XIII saw himself confronted when he began his pontificate.
<h2>Portugal</h2>

<p>His attention was called in the first instance to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, where the attack on the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> had already commenced. Joseph I, a weak and voluptuous prince, was a mere puppet in the hands of his minister, Sebasti&#227;o Carvalho, afterwards <a href="../cathen/16075a.htm">Marquis de Pombal</a>, a secret adherent of the Voltairian opinions, and bent on the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. A rebellion of the Indians in the Uruguay Reductions gave him his first opportunity. The cause of the rebellion was obvious, for the natives had been ordered to abandon forthwith their cultivated lands and migrate into the virgin forest. But, as they were under the care of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionaries, Carvalho declared that those must have instigated the natives. Moreover, on 3 September, 1758, Joseph I was shot at, apparently by the injured husband of a lady he had seduced. <a href="../cathen/12224b.htm">Pombal</a> held a secret trial in which he pronounced the whole Tavora <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> guilty, and with them three <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>, against whom the sole evidence was that they had been friends of the Tavoras. Then, on the pretext that all <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> thought alike, he <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> their superiors, some hundred in number, in his subterranean dungeons, and wrote in the king's name to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for permission from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to punish the guilty <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. Clement did not see his way to refuse a request backed by the king's assurances that he had good grounds for his charges, but he begged that the accused might have a careful trial, and that the innocent might not be included in a punishment they had not deserved. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> letter was written with exquisite courtesy and consideration, but <a href="../cathen/12224b.htm">Pombal</a> pronounced it insulting to his master and returned it to the sender. Then he shipped off all the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> from <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and its colonies, save the superiors who were still detained in their <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a>, and sent them to <a href="../cathen/03798b.htm">Civitavecchia</a>, "as a present to the pope", without a penny from their confiscated funds left to them for their maintenance. Clement, however, received them kindly, and provided for their needs. It was to be expected that diplomatic relations would not long continue after these events; they were severed in 1760 by <a href="../cathen/12224b.htm">Pombal</a>, who sent back the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, <a href="../cathen/01096b.htm">Acciajuoli</a>, and recalled his own ambassador; nor were these relations restored till the next pontificate. <a href="../cathen/12224b.htm">Pombal</a> had seen the necessity of supporting his administrative measures by an endeavour to destroy the good name of his victims with the public. For this purpose he caused various defamatory publications to be written, chief among which was the "Brief Relation", in which the American <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were represented as having set up an independent kingdom in South America under their own sovereignty, and of tyrannizing over the Indians, all in the interest of an insatiable <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> and <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>. These <a href="../cathen/09210a.htm">libels</a> were spread broadcast, especially through <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and elsewhere wrote to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> protesting against charges so improbable in themselves, and so incompatible with their experience of the order in their own jurisdictions. The text of many of their letters and of Clement XIII's approving replies may be seen in the "Appendices" to <a href="../cathen/12667b.htm">P&#232;re de Ravignan's</a> "Cl&eacute;ment XIII et Cl&eacute;ment XIV".


<h2>France</h2>

<p>It was to be expected that the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society's</a> many enemies in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> would be stimulated to follow in the footsteps of <a href="../cathen/12224b.htm">Pombal</a>. The attack was opened by the Parlement, which was predominantly <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> in its composition, in the spring of 1761. Taking advantage of the financial difficulties into which the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had been driven over the affair of Father Lavalette, they proceeded to examine the constitutions of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> in which they professed to find grave improprieties, and to demand that, if the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were to remain in the country, these constitutions should be remodelled on the principle of reducing the power of the general and practically substituting for him a commissioner appointed by the Crown. They also drew up a famous document, named the "Extraits des assertions", made up entirely of garbled extracts from <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> writers, and tending to show that their method was to establish their own domination by justifying almost every form of crime and licentiousness, particularly <a href="../cathen/15108a.htm">tyrannicide</a>. Louis XV, like Joseph I, had a will enervated by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, but unlike him, was by no means a fool, and had besides an underlying respect for religion. Thus he sought, in the first instance, to save a body of men whom he judged to be innocent, and for that purpose he referred their constitutions to the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in December, 1761. Forty-five of these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> reported in favour of the constitutions, and of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> being left as they were, twenty-seven or more, not then in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, sending in their adhesion; but the king was being drawn the other way by his Voltairian statesmen and Madame de Pompadour, and accordingly preferred the advice of the one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who sided with the Parlement, Bishop Fitz-James of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>. He therefore issued an edict in March, 1762, which allowed the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> to remain in the kingdom, but prescribed some essential changes in their institute with the view of satisfying the Parlement.

<p>Clement XIII intervened in various ways in this crisis of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. He wrote to the king in June, 1761, and again in January, 1762, on the former occasion to implore him to stay the proceedings of his Parlement, on the latter to protest against the scheme of setting a French vicar- general, independent of the general in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, over the French provinces; it was likewise on this latter occasion that, whilst blaming their general for the compliance of some of his French subjects, he used the famous words "Sint ut sint aut non sint". To the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who wrote to him protesting against the doings of the Parlement, he replied in words of thankfulness and approval, e.g. to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a> on 4 April, 1762, and to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sarlat (with special reference to the "Extraits des assertions") on 14 November. 1764; and to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> collectively in June, 1762, exhorting them to use all their influence with the king to induce him to resist his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counsellors. To the <em>arr&eacute;t</em> of 2 August, 1762, by which the Parlement <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppressed the Society</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and imposed impossible conditions on any of its members wishing to remain in the country, Clement replied by an Allocution of 3 September, in which he protested against the invasion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, and annulled the <em>arr&eacute;ts</em> of the Parlement against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>. Finally, when the king, weakly yielding to the pressure of his entourage, <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppressed</a> the French provinces by his edict of November, 1764, the Holy Father felt it his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, besought as he was by so many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from all parts, to publish the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Apostolicum", of 9 January, 1765. Its object was to oppose to the current misrepresentations of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society's</a> institute, spiritual exercises, preaching missions, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, a solemn and formal <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>, and to declare that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself was assailed in these condemnations of what she sanctioned in so many ways.
<h2>Spain</h2>

<p>The statesmen who had the ear of Charles III were in regular correspondence with the <a href="../cathen/05418a.htm">French Encyclopedists</a>, and had for some years previously been projecting a proscription of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> on the same lines as in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. But this was not known to the public, or to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who believed themselves to have a warm friend in their sovereign. It came then as a surprise to all when, on the night of 2-3 April, 1767, all the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> houses were suddenly surrounded, the inmates arrested and transferred to vehicles ordered to take them to the coast, thence to be shipped off for some unknown destination&mdash;forbidden to take anything with them beyond the clothes which they wore. Nor was any other explanation vouchsafed to the outer world save that contained in the king's letter to Clement XIII, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 31 March. There it was stated that the king had found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to expel all his <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> subjects for reasons which he intended to reserve for ever in his royal breast, but that he was sending them all to <a href="../cathen/03798b.htm">Civitavecchia</a> that they might be under the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> care, and he would allow them a maintenance of 100 piastres (i.e. Spanish dollars) a year&mdash;a maintenance, however, which would be withdrawn for the whole body, should any one of them venture at any time to write anything in self-defence or in criticism of the motives for the expulsion. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> wrote back on 16 April a very touching letter in which he declared that this was the cruelest blow of all to his paternal heart, beseeching the king to see that if any were accused they should not be condemned without proper trial, and assuring him that the charges current against the institute and the whole body of its members were misrepresentations due to the malice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> enemies. But nothing could be extracted from the king, and it is now known that this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a royal secret was merely a pretext devised in order to prevent the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> from having any say in the matter.

<p>Foreseeing the difficulty of so large an influx of expelled religious into his states, Clement felt compelled to refuse them permission to land, and after various wanderings they had to settle down in <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsica</a>, where they were joined by their brethren who had been similarly sent away from Spanish America. When, a year and a half later, they were forced to move again, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> compassion overcame his administrative <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and he permitted them to take refuge in his territory. On the throne of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> was seated a son of Charles III, and on that of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> his nephew. Both were minors, and both had Voltairian <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> through whose instrumentality their policy was directed from <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. Accordingly the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> in their dominions were similarly banished, and their banishment drew similar remonstrances from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. But in the case of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> there was a complication, for this state having been for centuries regarded as a fief of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had felt himself bound to condemn by his <em>Monitorium</em> of 30 January, 1768, some <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> passed by the duke to the detriment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> liberties. The Bourbon Courts thereupon united in demanding the withdrawal of the <em>Monitorium,</em> threatening, if refused to deprive the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by armed force of his territories of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and the Vanaissin in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> and Montecorto in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Finally, on 18, 20, 22 January, 1769, the ambassadors of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> presented to him identical notes demanding the total and entire <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression of the Society of Jesus</a> throughout the world. It was this that killed him. He expired under the shock on the night of 2-3 February. In one sense, no doubt, his pontificate was a failure, and he has been blamed for a lack of foresight which should have made him yield to the exigencies of the times. But in a higher sense it was a splendid success. For he had the insight to see through the plausible pretences of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> enemies, and to discern the ultimate ends which they were pursuing. He viewed the course of events ever in the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and was ever faithful to his trust. He always took up sound positions, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to defend them with language conspicuous for its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, as well as for its moderation and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> tenderness. His pontificate, in short, afforded the spectacle of a saint clad in moral strength contending alone against the powers of the world and their physical might; and such a spectacle is an acquisition forever.

<p>There were other aspects under which Clement XIII had to contend with the prevailing <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Regalism and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, but these by comparison were of minor moment. Among the pernicious books condemned by him were the "Histoire du peuple de Dieu" of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Berruyer, the "Esprit" of Helv&eacute;tius, the "Exposition de la doctrine chr&eacute;tienne" of M&eacute;senguy, the <a href="../cathen/05418a.htm">"Encyclop&eacute;die"</a> of D'Alembert and Diderot, and the "De Statu Ecclesi&aelig;" of <a href="../cathen/07463a.htm">Febronius</a>. He greatly encouraged devotion to the Sacred Heart, and ordered the Preface of the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Blessed Trinity</a> to be recited on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>.
