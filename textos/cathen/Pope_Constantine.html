<h1>Pope Constantine</h1>  

<p>Consecrated 25 March, 708; d. 9 April, 715; a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a>, the son of John, and "a remarkably affable man". The first half of his reign was marked by a cruel famine in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the second by an extraordinary abundance. For some time he had trouble with Felix, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, whom he had himself <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. Relying on the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular power</a>, the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> refused to offer the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> due obedience. It was only after he had tasted of dire misfortune that Felix submitted. Constantine received as <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> two Anglo-Saxon kings, <a href="../cathen/04092d.htm">Coenred of Mercia</a> and <a href="../cathen/11215c.htm">Offa of the East Saxons</a>. They both received the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and embraced the monastic life. (Bede, Hist. eccl., V, xix, xx.) <a href="../cathen/05329a.htm">St. Egwin</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15703a.htm">Worcester</a>, went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> along with them and obtained from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> various privileges for his <a href="../cathen/05648a.htm">monastery of Evesham</a>. ("Chron. Abbat.de Evesham", in R. S.; "St. Egwin and his Abbey of Evesham", London, 1904.) The extant documents regarding this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which bear this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> name are all spurious. (They are to be found in Haddan and Stubbs, "Councils", III, 281.) But his privilege for the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Bermondsey and Woking (ibid., 276) may be genuine.

<p>In 692 the Emperor Justinian II had caused to assemble the so-called <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Quinisext or Trullan Council</a>. At this assembly, which was attended only by Greek <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, 102 canons were passed, many of which established customs opposed to those of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. By canon xiii the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> of the Greek <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> became a thing of the past; and by canon xxxvi, a further step was taken in the direction of rendering the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of constantinople quite independent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Justinian made every effort to secure the adhesion of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> to these decrees. But one after another they all refused. At length he sent an order to Constantine to repair to Constantinople. Leaving behind him, according to the custom at the time, the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, and the <em>Primicerius,</em> or chief of the notaries, to govern the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in his absence, he set sail for the East (709) with a number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Wherever his vessel touched, he was, by Justinian's orders, received with as much <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> as the emperor himself. He entered Constantinople in triumph, and at Justinian's request crossed over to <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, where he was then residing. Strange to say, this cruel prince received the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with the greatest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, prostrating himself before him and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissing</a> his feet. After receiving <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he renewed all the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. Exactly what passed between them on the subject of the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Quinisext Council</a> is not known. It would appear, however, that Constantine approved those canons which were not opposed to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith or to sound <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, and that with this qualified approval of his council the emperor was content.

<p>Soon after Constantine's return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Oct., 711), Justinian II was dethroned by Philippicus Bardanes. The new emperor strove to revive <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelism</a>, and sent a letter to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> which the latter caused to be examined in a synod and condemned. Further, as the emperor burnt the Acts of the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Sixth General Council</a>, restored to the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> the names which that council had caused to be erased, re-erected their images, and removed the representation of the council which was hanging in front of the palace, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the people of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> placed in the portico of St. Peter's a series of representations of the six <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general councils</a>, and refused to place the new emperor's name on their charters or their money. They also declined to place his <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, according to custom, in the official <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. C&aelig;sarius on the Palatine, the site of which has just been discovered (1907), or to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him in the Canon of the Mass. To punish the Romans for these daring measures, a new duke was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and they would no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> have had much to suffer but for the opportune deposition of Philippicus by the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Anastasius (Whitsun Eve, 713). The new emperor made haste to dispatch to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, through the Exarch Scholasticus, a letter in which he professed his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> and his adhesion to the <a href="../cathen/04310a.htm">Sixth General Council</a>, which had condemned <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelism</a>. Constantine also received a letter from John, the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, acknowledging that the "apostolical pre-eminence of the Pope is to the whole Church, what the head is to the body", and that "according to the canons he is the head of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>". John assured the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> that, while co-operating with the Emperor Philippicus, he had always been <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> at heart, and that the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, drawn up at the council in which the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> emperor had hoped to re-establish <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelism</a> (712), was really <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> in sense, although not apparently so in words. (See John's letter in the epilogue of the Deacon Agatho, in <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Coll. Conc.", XII, 192.)

<p>Among other distinguished men who came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the days of Constantine was Benedict, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. He came not only to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> at the shrines of the Apostles, for he was a man of such remarkable <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> that he was distinguished for it in all <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (<a href="../cathen/11591b.htm">Paul the Deacon</a>, Hist., VI, xxix), but also to discuss with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as to whose immediate <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> belonged the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Pavia. At one time, certainly in the fifth century, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Pavia were subject to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by them. For some reason, perhaps because the Lombards made Pavia their capital, its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had ceased to be dependent on those of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and had become directly subject to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. Accordingly, when it had been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to Benedict that for some long time at least they had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he definitely surrendered his claim to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over them. The visit of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to a city at any distance from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> being so comparatively rare, the people of several places at which Constantine touched in his journey to and from Constantinople were only too pleased to be able to avail themselves of the opportunity of getting him to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for them. It is on record that he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> twelve in this way, and, at the customary times and places, no less than sixty-four.
