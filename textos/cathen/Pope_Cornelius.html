<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope Cornelius</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a> (251 to 253).

<p>We may accept the statement of the Liberian catalogue that he reigned two years, three months, and ten days, for Lipsius, Lightfoot, and Harnack have shown that this list is a first-rate authority for this date. His predecessor, Fabian, was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decius</a>, 20 January, 250. About the beginning of March, 251 the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> slackened, owing to the absence of the emperor, against whom two rivals had arisen. It was possible to assemble sixteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and Cornelius was elected though against his will (Cyprian, Ep. lv, 24), "by the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by the testimony of almost all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, by the vote of the people then present, by the consent of aged <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and of good men, at a time when no one had been made before him, when the place of Fabian, that is the place of Peter, and the step of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> chair were vacant". "What <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in his acceptance of the episcopate, what strength of mind, what firmness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that he took his seat intrepid in the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> chair, at a time when the tyrant in his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was making unspeakable threats, when he heard with far more patience that a rival prince was arising against him, than that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was appointed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>" (ibid., 9). Is he not, asks <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, to be numbered among the glorious confessors and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who sat so long awaiting the sword or the cross or the stake and every other torture?

<p>A few weeks later the Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> made himself <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, and the whole <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a> was convulsed by the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. But the adhesion of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> secured to Cornelius the hundred <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Africa, and the influence of St. Dionysius the Great, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, brought the East within a few months to a right decision. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> itself the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> got together a synod of sixty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">N<font size=-2>OVATIAN</font></a>.) Fabius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, seems to have wavered. Three letters to him from Cornelius were known to <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, who gives extracts from one of them (<a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.43</a>), in which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> details the faults in Novatian's election and conduct with considerable bitterness. We incidentally learn that in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> there were forty-six <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, seven <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, forty-two <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>, fifty-two ostiarii, and over one thousand five hundred <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in distress. From this Burnet estimated the number of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at fifty thousand, so also Gibbon; but Benson and Harnack think this figure possibly too large. Pope Fabian had made seven regions; it appears that each had one <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, one <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> and six <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>. Of the letters of Cornelius to <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> two have come down to us, together with nine from <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Mgr. Merrati has shown that in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> text the letters of Cornelius are in the colloquial "vulgar-Latin" of the day, and not in the more classical style affected by the ex-orator <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> and the learned <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>. Cornelius sanctioned the milder measures proposed by <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> and accepted by his Carthaginian council of 251 for the restoration to communion, after varying forms of penance, of those who had fallen during the <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decian</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> (see <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">C<font size=-2>YPRIAN</font></a>).

<p>At the beginning of 252 a new <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> suddenly broke out. Cornelius was exiled to Centumcell&aelig; (Civita Vecchia). There were no defections among the Roman <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; all were confessors. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> "led his brethren in confession", writes <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> (Ep. lx, ad Corn.), with a manifest reference to the confession of St. Peter. "With one heart and one voice the whole <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> confessed. Then was seen, dearest Brother, that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which the blessed Apostle praised in you (<a href="../bible/rom001.htm#vrs8">Romans 1:8</a>); even then he foresaw in spirit your glorious <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and firm strength." In June Cornelius died a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, as <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> repeatedly calls him. The Liberian catalogue has <em>ibi cum glori&#226; dormicionem accepit,</em> and this may mean that he died of the rigours of his banishment, though later accounts say that he was beheaded. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> says that Cornelius and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> suffered on the same day in different years, and his careless statement has been generally followed. The feast of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> was in fact kept at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Cornelius, for the fourth century "Depositio Martirum" has "XVIII kl octob Cypriani Afric&aelig; Rom&aelig; celebratur in Callisti". St. Cornelius was not buried in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, but in an adjoining <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a>, perhaps that of a branch of the noble Cornelii. His inscription is in Latin: <font size=-2>CORNELIUS* MARTYR*</font> whereas those of Fabian and Lucius are in Greek (<a href="../cathen/11111a.htm">Northcote</a> and Brownlow, "Roma sotteranea", I, vi). His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept with that of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> on 14 September, possibly the day of his translation from Centumcell&aelig; to the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The two Latin letters will be found in all editions of CYPRIAN. A better text is in MERCATI, <em>D'alcuni muori sussidi per la critica del texto di S. Cipriano</em> (Rome, 1899). They will be found with the fragments in COUSTANT, <em>Epp. Rom. Pontt.</em> and in ROUTH, <em>Reliqu&#230; Sacr&#230;.</em> There is a spurious letter to St. Cyprian in the appendix to his works, another to Lupicinus of Vienne, and two more were forged by Pseudo-Isidore. All these will be found in the collections of councils and in MIGNE. The pseudo-Cyprianic <em>Ad Novatianum</em> is attributed to Cornelius by NELKE, <em>Die Chronol. der Correspondenz Cyprians</em> (Thorn, 1902); but it is by an unknown contemporary. On Cornelius see TILLEMONT, III; <em>Acta SS.</em> 14 Sept.; BENSON, <em>Cyprian</em> (London, 1897). The <em>Acta</em> of St. Cornelius are valueless.</p></div>
