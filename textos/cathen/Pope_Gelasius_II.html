<h1>Pope Gelasius II</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/06333a.htm">Gaeta</a>, year unknown; elected 24 Jan., 1118; died at Cluny, 29 Jan., 1119. No sooner had <a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">Paschal II</a> ended his stormy pontificate, than the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, knowing that the emperor, Henry V, had concerted measures with a faction of the Roman nobility to force the selection of a pliant imperial candidate, met secretly in a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the Palatine. Having dispatched a messenger to <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, to summon the aged chancellor, Cardinal John of <a href="../cathen/06333a.htm">Gaeta</a>, they turned a deaf ear to his entreaties and unanimously declared him <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>John was of a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, probably the Gaetani. Early in his life he entered the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, where he made such progress in learning and became so proficient in Latin, that, under successive pontiffs, he held the office of chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. He was the trusted advisor of Paschal II; shared his captivity and shielded him against the zealots who charged the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> for having, under dire compulsion, signed the "Privilegium", which constituted the emperor lord and master of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> and episcopal elections (see <a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">P<font size=-2>ASCHAL</font> II</a> and <a href="../cathen/08084c.htm">I<font size=-2>NVESTITURES</font></a>). When the news spread that the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> had elected a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> without consulting the emperor, the imperialist party broke down the doors of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; and their leader, Cenzio Frangipani, seized the new pontiff by the throat, cast him to the ground, stamped on him with spurred feet, dragged him by the hair to his neighbouring castle, and threw him, loaded with chains, into a dungeon. Indignant at this brutal deed, the Romans rose in their might; and, surrounding the robber's den, demanded the instant liberation of the pontiff. Frangipani, intimidated, released the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, threw himself at his feet, and begged and obtained <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. A procession was formed, and amidst shouts of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> Gelasius II (so he termed himself) was conducted into the Lateran and <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a>.

<p>The triumph was of short duration; for, 2 March, the formidable figure of Henry V was seen in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. As soon as he had heard of the proceedings at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he left his army at <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> and hastened to the capital. Gelasius immediately determined upon flight. On a stormy night, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and his court proceeded in two galleys down the Tiber, pelted by the imperialists with stones and arrows. After several mishaps Gelasius at length reached <a href="../cathen/06333a.htm">Gaeta</a>, where he was received by the Normans with open arms. Being only a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, he received successively <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> and episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Meanwhile, the emperor, ignoring the action of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, placed on the throne of St. Peter a senile creature of royal power, <a href="../cathen/06795b.htm">Maurice Burdinus</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, who had the audacity to take the <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> name of <em>Gregory</em>. Gelasius pronounced a solemn <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against both of them; and as soon as the emperor, frustrated of his prey, left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he returned secretly; but soon took the resolution of taking refuge in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He went by way of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, where he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> its splendid marble <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. He was received by the French with the utmost reverence. The powerful minister of Louis VI, the <a href="../cathen/14326a.htm">Abbot Suger</a>, conducted him to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Cluny. Gelasius was perfecting plans for the convocation of a great council at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, when he succumbed to pleurisy, leaving the consummation of the fifty years' <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> for freedom to his successor, <a href="../cathen/03183d.htm">Callistus II</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> and <a href="../cathen/12798b.htm">Reumont</a> agree in pronouncing that no historical personage ever compressed so many misfortunes into the short space of a year and five days. There seems to be no reason why the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> should not take up his case for <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>. <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> tells us ("De Beat. et Canon.", I, xli, n. 30) that in his time the question was mooted; but for one reason or another it was overlooked. The life of Gelasius was written by his intimate friend, Pandulphus of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, an eye-witness to what he narrates; it is in Muratori, "Rer. ital. Scr.", III, 1 sqq.
