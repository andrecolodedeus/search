<h1>Pope Gregory V</h1>  

<p>Born c. 970; died 4 February, 999. On the death of <a href="../cathen/08427c.htm">John XV</a> the Romans sent a deputation to <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> and asked him to name the one he would wish them to elect in the place of the deceased pontiff. He at once mentioned his <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and relation, Bruno, the son of Duke Otto of Carinthia and of Judith. He was already (996) distinguished for learning, especially for his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the dialects which were to develop into the languages of modern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. If possessed of a somewhat hasty disposition, he was nevertheless a worthy candidate for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, and his election did <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the Romans who elected him. This first German <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 3 May, 996, and his accession was generally hailed with satisfaction. One of his first acts was to crown Otto emperor (21 May, 996). Throughout the whole of his pontificate he acted in full harmony with his imperial cousin. Together they held a synod a few days after Otto's <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>, in which Arnulf was ordered to be restored to the See of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, and Gerbert, the future Sylvester II, was condemned as an intruder. Unfortunately for himself and the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he prevailed upon the emperor not to banish from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the turbulent noble Crescentius Numentanus, "of the Marble Horse". No sooner did Otto leave <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> than Crescentius roused his adherents to arms and Gregory had to fly to the north. Crescentius did not stop here, but caused an <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> to be proclaimed in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the crafty Italo-Greek John Philagathus of <a href="../cathen/13203a.htm">Rossano</a>, who had artfully made a position for himself at the court of the Ottos and now took the title of <a href="../cathen/08427c.htm">John XVI</a> (997).

<p>At a synod which Gregory had ordered to meet at <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, not only were Crescentius and his <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>, but King Robert of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was threatened with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> if he did not put away <a href="../cathen/02519a.htm">Bertha</a> whom he had married though she was related to him not only by spiritual relationship but by blood. After some opposition, Robert finally yielded, and, repenting of his misdeeds, repudiated <a href="../cathen/02519a.htm">Bertha</a> and espoused Constance. Gerbert, too, after having been condemned by this synod also, abandoned the See of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, and was rewarded with the See of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. Furious that he authority had been so flouted, Otto marched upon <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Philagathus fled from the city and Crescentius shut himself up in the Castle of Sant' Angelo. The emperor's troops pursued the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, captured him, deprived him of his nose, ears, eyes, and tongue, and brought him back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There he was brought before Otto and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and publicly degraded (998). Then, after being driven ignominiously through the streets of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on an ass, he was transported to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where he seems to have died in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> (1013). The castle of Sant' Angelo was next besieged, and, when it was taken, Crescentius was hanged upon its walls (998). About the year 997, Archbishop Aelfric came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in order to procure his <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, and to consult the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> about replacing the secular canons, who then held the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, in accordance with the commission he had received from King Ethelred and the Witan. As a mark of special <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, Gregory put his own <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> on Aelfrie, and bade him put into his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> "men of that order which the Blessed Gregory commanded Augustine therein to place". At the request of Otto, Gregory granted exceptional privileges to many German <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and in his company held various <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> for the regulation of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs. He had to threaten with <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> Ardoin, Marquess of <a href="../cathen/08258a.htm">Ivrea</a>, if he did not make amends for his treatment of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of St. Mary's of <a href="../cathen/08258a.htm">Ivrea</a>, its serfs, and its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Gregory V was buried in St. Peter's "in front of the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, i.e. on the Gospel side, near <a href="../cathen/11602a.htm">Pope Pelagius</a>".
