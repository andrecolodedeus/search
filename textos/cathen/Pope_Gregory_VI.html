<h1>Pope Gregory VI</h1>  

<p>(JOHN GRATIAN).

<p>Date of birth unknown; elected 1 May 1045; abdicated at Sutri, 20 December, 1046; died probably at <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, in the beginning of 1048. In 1045 the youthful libertine <a href="../cathen/02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a> occupied the chair of Peter. Anxious, in order so it is said, that he might marry, to vacate a position into which, though wholly unfit, he had been thrust by his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, he consulted his godfather, John Gratian, the Archpriest of St. John "ad portam Latinam", a man of great <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for uprightness of character, as to whether he could resign the supreme pontificate. When he was convinced that he might do so, he offered to give up the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> into the hands of his godfather for a large sum of money. Desirous of ridding the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">See of Rome</a> on such an unworthy pontiff, John Gratian in all <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> and simplicity paid him the money and was recognized as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in his stead. Unfortunately the accession of Gratian, who took the name of Gregory VI, though it was hailed with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> even by such a strict upholder of the right as <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a>, did not bring peace to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. When Benedict left the city after selling the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, there was already another aspirant to the See of Peter in the field. John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sabina, had been saluted as Pope Sylvester III by that faction of the nobility which had driven <a href="../cathen/02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1044, and had then installed him in his stead. Though the expelled pontiff (<a href="../cathen/02429a.htm">Benedict IX</a>) soon returned, and forced John to retire to his See of Sabina, that pretender never gave up his claims, and through his party contrived apparently to keep some hold on a portion of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Benedict, also unable, it seems, to obtain the bride on whom he had set his heart, soon repented of his resignation, again claimed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, and in his turn is thought to have succeeded in acquiring dominion over a part of the city.

<p>With an empty exchequer and a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> that had largely lost the savour of righteousness, Gregory was confronted by an almost hopeless task. Nevertheless, with the aid of his "capellanus" or <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>, Hildebrand, destined to be the great <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Pope Gregory VII</a>, he essayed to bring about civil and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order. He strove to effect the latter by letters and by councils, and the former by force of arms. But the factions of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipopes</a> were too strong to be put down by him, and the confusion only increased. Convinced that nothing would meet the case but German intervention, a number of influential <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> separated themselves from communion with Gregory or either of the two would-be <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and implored the warlike King Henry III to cross the Alps and restore order. Nothing loath, Henry descended into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in the autumn of 1046. Strong in the conviction of his innocence, Gregory went north to meet him. He was received by the king with all the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> due to a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and in accordance with the royal request, summoned a council to meet at Sutri. Of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipopes</a>, Sylvester alone presented himself at the synod, which was opened 20 Dec., 1046. Both his claim to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and that of Benedict were soon disposed of. Deprived of all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> rank and considered a usurper from the beginning, Sylvester was condemned to be confined in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for the rest of his life. Benedict's case also presented no difficulty. He had now no claim to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, as he had <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> resigned it. But it was different with Gregory. However, when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the synod had convinced him that the act by which he had become <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">supreme pontiff</a> was in itself <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a>, and had called upon him to resign, Gregory, seeing that little choice was left him, of his own accord laid down his office. A German, Suidger, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bainberg (<a href="../cathen/04017a.htm">Clement II</a>), was then elected to replace him. Accompanied by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a>, Gregory was taken by Henry to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (May, 1047), where he soon died.
