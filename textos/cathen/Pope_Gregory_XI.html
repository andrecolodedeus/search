<h1>Pope Gregory XI</h1>  

<p>(PIERRE ROGER DE BEAUFORT).

<p>Born in 1331, at the castle of Maumont in the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>; died 27 March, 1378, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was a nephew of <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Pope Clement VI</a>, who heaped numerous <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> upon him and finally created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal deacon</a> in 1348, when he was only eighteen years of age. As <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> he attended the <a href="../cathen/11737a.htm">University of Perugia</a>, became a skilled canonist and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, and gained the esteem of all by his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a> and purity of heart. After the death of <a href="../cathen/15214a.htm">Urban V</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> unanimously elected him <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, on December, 1370. He chose the name of Gregory XI, had himself <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 4 January, 1371, and was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on the following day. Immediately on his accession he attempted to reconcile the Kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but failed. He succeeded, however, in pacifying Castile, <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, <a href="../cathen/10721a.htm">Navarre</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. He also made efforts towards the reunion of the Greek and Latin Churches, the undertaking of a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, and the reform of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Soon, however, he had to give his entire attention to the turbulent affairs of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Duke Bernabo Visconti of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, an inveterate enemy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, had in 1371 made himself master of <a href="../cathen/12717a.htm">Reggio</a> and other places that were feudatory to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. When all other means to bring him to terms had failed, Gregory XI placed him under the ban. Bernabo compelled the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> that brought him the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> to eat the parchment on which his <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> was written, and heaped many other insults upon them. Hereupon Gregory XI declared <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon him in 1372. Success was at first on the side of Bernabo, but when Gregory XI obtained the support of the emperor, the Queen of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, the King of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, and bought into his service the English condottiere John Hawkwood, Bernabo sued for peace. By bribing some of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> councillors he obtained a favourable truce on 6 June, 1374.

<p>Like the preceding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, Gregory XI made the fatal mistake of appointing <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a>, who did not understand the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> and whom the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> and governors of the ecclesiastical provinces in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The Florentines, however, feared that a strengthening of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> would impair their own prestige in Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and allied themselves with Bernabo in July, 1375. Both Bernabo and the Florentines did their utmost to stir up an insurrection in the pontifical territory among all those that were dissatisfied with the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. They were so successful that within a short time the entire <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Patrimony of St. Peter</a> was up in arms against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Highly incensed at the seditious proceedings of the Florentines, Gregory XI imposed an extremely severe punishment upon them. He put Florence under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> its inhabitants, and outlawed them and their possessions. The financial loss which the Florentines sustained thereby was inestimable. They sent <a href="../cathen/03447a.htm">St. Catherine of Siena</a> to intercede for them with Gregory XI, but frustrated her efforts by continuing their hostilities against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In the midst of these disturbances Gregory XI, yielding to the urgent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of St. Catherine, decided to remove the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">papal see</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, despite the protests of the French King and the majority of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. He left <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> on 13 September, 1376, boarded the ship at Marsailles on 2 October, and came by way of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> to Corneto on 6 December. Here he remained until arrangements were made in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> concerning its future government. On 13 January, 1377, he left Corneto, landed at <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> on the following day, and sailed up the Tiber to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Paolo, from where he solemnly made his entrance into <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 17 January. But his return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> did not put an end to the hostilities. The <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> massacre of <a href="../cathen/03546b.htm">Cesena</a>, which was ordered by <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Cardinal Robert of Geneva</a> (afterwards <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>), embittered the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> still more against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The continuous riots in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> induced Gregory XI to remove to Anagui towards the end of May, 1377. He gradually quelled the commotion and returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 7 Nov., 1377, where he died while a congress of peace was in process at Sarzano. Gregory XI was the last <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of French nationality. He was learned and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, though not free from nepotism. In 1374 he approved the Order of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">Hermits</a> of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, and on 22 May, 1377, he issued five <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bulls</a> in which the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a> were condemned. He was so disgusted with the conditions at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that only death prevented him from returning to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>. The Great Schism began after his death.
