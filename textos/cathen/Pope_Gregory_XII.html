<h1>Pope Gregory XII</h1>  

<p>(ANGELO CORRARIO, now CORRER).

<p>Legal <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> during the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>; born at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, of a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, about 1327; died at <a href="../cathen/12675a.htm">Recanati</a>, 18 October, 1417.

<p>He became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03409b.htm">Castello</a> in 1380 and titular <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople in 1390. Under <a href="../cathen/08019a.htm">Pope Innocent VII</a> he was made Apostolic secretary, the Legate of <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, and finally, in 1405, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of San Mareo. It was due to his great <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and his earnest desire for the end of the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">schism</a> that after the death of <a href="../cathen/08019a.htm">Innocent VII</a> the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> unanimously elected him <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on 30 Nov., 1406. He took the name of Gregory XII. Before the papal election each <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> that in order to end the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">schism</a> he would abdicate the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> if he should be elected, provided his rival at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> (<a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>) would do the same. Gregory XII repeated his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> after his election and to all appearances had the intention to keep it. On 12 Dec., 1406, he notified <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> of his election and the stipulation under which it took place, at the same time reiterating his willingness to lay down the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a> if Benedict would do the same. Benedict apparently agreed to the proposals of Gregory XII and expressed his desire to have a conference with him. After long negotiations the two pontiffs agreed to meet at <a href="../cathen/13489c.htm">Savona</a>. The meeting, however, never took place. Benedict, though openly protesting his desire to meet Gregory XII, gave various indications that he had not the least intention to renounce his claims to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>; and Gregory XII, though sincere in the beginning, also soon began to waver. The relatives of Gregory XII, to whom he was always inordinately attached, and King Ladislaus of Naples, for political reasons used all their efforts to prevent the meeting of the pontiffs. The reason, pretended or real, put forth by Gregory XII for refusing to meet his rival, was his fear that Benedict had hostile designs upon him and would use their conference only as a ruse to capture him. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of Gregory XII openly showed their dissatisfaction at his procedure and gave signs of their intention to forsake him. On 4 May, 1408, Gregory XII convened his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> at <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, ordered them not to leave the city under any pretext, and created four of his nephews <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, despite his promise in the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> that he would create no new <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. Seven of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> secretly left Lucca and negotiated with the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of Benedict concerning the convocation of a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> by them at which both pontiffs should be deposed and a new one elected. They summoned the council to <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and invited both pontiffs to be present. Neither Gregory XII nor <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> appeared. At the fifteenth session (5 June, 1409), the council deposed the two pontiffs, and elected <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Alexander V</a> on 26 June, 1409. Meanwhile Gregory stayed with his loyal and powerful protector, Prince Charles of <a href="../cathen/09566a.htm">Malatesta</a>, who had come to <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> in person during the process of the council, in order to effect an understanding between Gregory XII and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of both obediences. All his efforts were useless. Gregory XII, who had meanwhile created ten other <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, convoked a council at Cividale del Friuli, near <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, for 6 June, 1409. At this council, though only a few <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had appeared, <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Alexander V</a> were pronounced schismatics, <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjurers</a>, and devastators of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>Though forsaken by most of his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, Gregory XII was still the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and was recognized as such by Rupert, King of the Romans, King Ladislaus of Naples, and some Italian princes. The <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> finally put an end to the intolerable situation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. At the fourteenth session (4 July, 1415) a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of Gregory XII was read which appointed <a href="../cathen/09566a.htm">Malatesta</a> and Cardinal Dominici of <a href="../cathen/12633c.htm">Ragusa</a> as his proxies at the council. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> then read a mandatory of Gregory XII which convoked the council and authorized its succeeding acts. Hereupon <a href="../cathen/09566a.htm">Malatesta</a>, acting in the name of Gregory XII, pronounced the resignation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> by Gregory XII and handed a written copy of the resignation to the assembly. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> accepted the resignation, retained all the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> that had been created by him, and appointed him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Porto and perpetual <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> at <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>. Two years later, before the election of the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/09725a.htm">Martin V</a>, Gregory XII died in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>.
