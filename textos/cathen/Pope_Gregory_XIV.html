<h1>Pope Gregory XIV</h1>  

<p>(N<font size=-2>ICCOL&Ograve;</font> S<font size=-2>FONDRATI</font>).

<p>Born at Somma, near <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, 11 Feb., 1535; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 15 Oct., 1591.

<p>His father Francesco, a <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> senator, had, after the death of his wife, been created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a>, in 1544. Niccol&ograve; studied at the Universities of <a href="../cathen/11737a.htm">Perugia</a> and <a href="../cathen/11387a.htm">Padua</a>, was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and then appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, in 1560. He participated in the sessions of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, 1561-1563, and was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of Santa Cecilia by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> on 12 December 1583. <a href="../cathen/15218a.htm">Urban VII</a> having died on 27 September, 1590, Sfondrati was elected to succeed him on 5 December, 1590, after a protracted <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of more than two months, and took the name of Gregory XIV. The new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had not aspired to the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a>. <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Cardinal Montalto</a>, who came to his cell to inform him that the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> had agreed on his election, found him kneeling in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> before a crucifix. When on the next day he was elected he burst into tears and said to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>: "God forgive you! What have you done?" From his youth he had been a man of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>. Before entering the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a> he was a constant companion of <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">Charles Borromeo</a>, and when <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, he was an intimate friend of Philip Neri whose holy life he strove to imitate.

<p>As soon as he became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he gave his energetic support to the French League, and took active measures against <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a>, in 1585, had declared a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> and excluded from succession to the French throne. In accordance with the Salic law, after the death of Henry III in 1589, <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a> was to succeed to the French throne, but the prevalent <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of those times was that no <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> could become King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, which was for the most part <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. The nobles, moreover, threatened to rise up against the rule of <a href="../cathen/07225a.htm">Henry of Navarre</a> unless he promised to become a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. In order to reconcile the nobility and the people to his reign, Henry declared on 4 August, 1589, that he would become a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and uphold the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. When Gregory XIV became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Henry had not yet fulfilled his promise and gave little hope of doing it in the near future. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, therefore, decided to assist the French League in its efforts to depose Henry by force of arms and in this he was encouraged by <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a>. In his monitorial letter to the Council of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1 March, 1591, he renewed the sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against Henry, and ordered the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, nobles, judicial functionaries, and the Third Estate of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to renounce him, under pain of severe penalties. He also sent a monthly subsidy of 15,000 sendi to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and dispatched his nephew Ercole Sfondrati to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> at the head of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> troops. In the midst of these operations against Henry, Gregory XIV died. after a short pontificate of 10 months and 10 days.

<p>Gregory XIV created five <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, among whom was his nephew Paolo Camillo Sfondrati. He vainly tried to induce Philip Neri to accept the purple. On 21 September, 1591, he raised to the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order the Congregation of the Fathers of a Good Death (Clerici regulares ministrantes infirmis) founded by St. Camillus de Lellis. In his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Cogit nos", <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 21 March, 1591, he forbade under pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> all bets concerning the election of a pope, the duration of a pontificate, or the creation of new <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. In a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 18 April, 1591, he ordered reparation to be made to the Indians of the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a> by their conquerors wherever it was possible, and commanded under pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> that all Indian slaves in the islands should be set free. Gregory XIV also appointed a commission to revise the Sixtine Bible and another commission to continue the revision of the Pian <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a>. The former commission had its first session on 7 Feb., 1591, the latter on 21 April, 1591. Concerning these two commissions see B&auml;umer, "Geschichte des Breviers" (Freiburg im Breisgau, 1895), pp. 479-90.
