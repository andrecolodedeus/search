<h1>Pope Gregory XVI</h1>  

<p>(MAURO, or BARTOLOMEO ALBERTO CAPPELLARI).

<p>Born at Belluno, then in the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> territory, 8 September, 1765; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 9 June, 1846. His father, Giovanni Battista, and his mother, Giulia Cesa-Pagani, were both of the minor nobility of the district and the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of both had in former times been prominent in the service of the state. When eighteen, Bartolomeo gave evidence of a <a href="../cathen/15498a.htm">religious vocation</a>, and after some opposition on the part of his relations, was clothed in 1783 as a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Michele di Murano, taking the name Mauro. Here, three years later, he was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> professed, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in 1787. The young <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> soon showed signs of unusual <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> gifts. He devoted himself to the study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, and was set to teach these to the juniors at San Michele. In 1790 he was appointed <em>censor librorum</em> for his order, as well as for the Holy Office at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. Five years later he was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he lived at first in a small house (since destroyed) in the Piazza Veneta, afterwards in the great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Gregorio on the Coelian Hill. The times were not favourable to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. In 1798 took place the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> <a href="../cathen/01032b.htm">abduction</a> of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> by General Berthier, at <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> orders, and in the following year the death of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in exile at <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a>. It was this very year, 1799, that Dom Mauro chose for the publication of his book, "Il trionfo della Santa Sede", upholding <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> and the temporal sovereignty. The work, according to Gregory himself, did not attract great attention till after he had become <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, yet it attained three editions and was translated into several languages. In 1800 Cardinal Chiaramonti was elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and took the name of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a>, and returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the same year. Early in that year Dom Mauro had been nominated Abbot Vicar of San Gregorio, and in 1805 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of that ancient house. He retired to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to rest, but returned in 1807 as <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> general, only to be driven out in the following year, when General Miollis repeated on the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> the outrage of Berthier on <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>. Dom Mauro returned to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, but San Michele was closed as a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> the next year by the emperor's orders. In spite of this the religious remained, in secular habit, at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and Dom Mauro taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> to the students of the <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> college at Murano. But, in 1813, the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Ognissanti at <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> being too disturbed and inimical. The following year <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> fell from power, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and Dom Mauro was at once summoned thither. In rapid succession the learned <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> was appointed consultor of various Congregations, examiner of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and again <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of San Gregorio. Twice he was offered a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> and twice he refused. It was considered certain that he would become a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and it caused general surprise when, in 1823, <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> chose in his stead the geographer, Dom Placisdo Zurla (also a <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a>). In that year the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> died, and Cardinal della Genga, who took the name of <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a>, was elected. On 21 March, 1825, the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> created Dom Mauro <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/08025b.htm"><em>in petto</em></a>, and the creation was published the following year. Cappillaria became <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of San Callisto and Prefect of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of Propaganda</a>. It was in this office that he successfully arranged a concordat between the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and King William of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> in 1827, between the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Ottoman Empire</a> in 1829. On <a href="../cathen/06453a.htm">St. George's</a> Day of the latter year Cardinal Capillaria had the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of learning that Catholic Emancipation had become a fact in the British Isles.

<p>On 10 February, 1829, <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> died, and <a href="../cathen/12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a>, broken by the revolutions in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a>, followed him to the grave on 1 December, 1830. A fortnight later the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> began. It lasted for seven weeks. At one time Cardinal Giustiniani appeared likely to secure the requisite number of votes, but <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> interposed with a veto. At last the various parties came to an agreement, and on the Feast of the Purification, Cardinal Capillaria was elected by thirty-one votes out of forty-five. He took the name of Gregory XVI, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a>, the founder of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. Hardly was the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> elected when the Revolution, which for some time had been smouldering throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, broke into flame in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>. Already on 2 February the Duke of <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a> had warned <a href="../cathen/01255a.htm">Cardinal Albani</a> that the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> must come to a speedy decision, as a revolution was imminent. The next day the duke caused the house of his erstwhile friend, Ciro Menotti, at <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, to be surrounded, and arrested him and several of his fellow conspirators. At once a revolt broke out at <a href="../cathen/12717a.htm">Reggio</a>, and the duke fled to <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, taking the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> with him. The disturbance spread with prearranged rapidity. On 4 February Bologna revolted, drove the pro-legate out of the town, and by the eighth had hoisted the tricolour instead of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> flag. Within a fortnight nearly the whole of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a> had repudiated the sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and on the nineteenth Cardinal Benvenuti, who was sent to quell the rebellion, became a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> of the "Provisional Government". Even in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself a rising projected for 12 February was only averted by the ready action of Cardinal Bernetti, the new secretary of state. In these conditions, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> forces being obviously unable to cope with the situation, Gregory decided to appeal to <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> for help. It was immediately forthcoming. On 25 February a strong Austrian force started for Bologna, and the "Provisional Government" soon fled to <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>. Within a month the whole movement had collapsed, and on 27 March Cardinal Benvenuti was released by the rebel leaders, on the understanding that an amnesty should be granted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> action, however, was without authority and was not endorsed, either by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> government or by the Austrian general. But the rebellion, for the moment, was crushed, and after an abortive attempt to seize <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, from which they were dissuaded by Archbishop Mastai-Ferretti, all the leaders who were able to do so fled the country. On 3 April the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was able to assert that order was re-established.



<p>In the same month, the representatives of the five powers, <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, met in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to consider the question of the "Reform of the Papal States". On 21 May they issued a joint Memorandum urging on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> government reforms in the judiciary, the introduction of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> into the administration, popular election of the communal and municipal councils, the administration of the finances by a skilled body selected largely from the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. Gregory undertook to carry out such of these proposed reforms as he deemed practicable, but on two points he was determined not to yield: he would never admit the principle of popular election to the councils, and he would never permit the establishment of a council of State, composed of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, parallel to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>. By a succession of edicts, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 5 July, 5 October, and 5 and 21 November, a comprehensive scheme of reform of the administration and of the judiciary was set afoot. The delegations were to be divided into a complex <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of central, provincial and communal governments. At the head of each of these bodies respectively was to be a pro-legate, a governor or a mayor, representing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and assisted by, and (in financial matters) controlled by, a council who was selected, out of a triple-elected list, by the government. All these bodies were to keep the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> informed as to the wished and requirements of his subjects. The reform of the judiciary, as regards civil litigation, was even more thorough. An end was put to the confusing multiplicity of tribunals (in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> no less than twelve out of the fifteen conflicting jurisdictions, including that of the arbitrary <em>uditore santissimo</em>, were abolished), and three hierarchies, composed each of three civil courts, one for Bologna and the legations, one for Romagna and the Marches, and one for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, were established. In each of these the agreement of any two courts inhibited further appeal, and most of the courts were to be composed largely of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> skilled in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. The criminal courts were not so radically reformed, but even in these an end was made of the vexatious and often tyrannous secrecy and irregularity that had hitherto prevailed.

<p>All these reforms, however, despite their extent, were far from satisfying the aims of the revolutionary party. The Austrian troops were withdrawn on 15 July, 1831, but by December much of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a> was again in revolt. Papal troops were dispatched to the aid of the legations, but the only result was the concentration of 2000 revolutionists at <a href="../cathen/03546b.htm">Cesena</a>. <a href="../cathen/01255a.htm">Cardinal Albani</a>, who had been appointed commissioner-extraordinary of the legations, appealed on his own authority for aid to the Austrian General Radetsky, who at once sent troops. These forces joined the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> troops at <a href="../cathen/03546b.htm">Cesena</a>, attacked and defeated the rebels, and by the end of January had taken triumphant possession of Bologna. This time <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> intervened, and as a protest against the Austrian occupation, seized and held <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, in sheer violation of <a href="../cathen/09073a.htm">international law</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and Bernetti protested energetically and even <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> disapproved of this act, but though, after long negotiations, the French commander was ordered to restrain the outrages of the revolutionists in <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, the French troops were not withdrawn from that city until the final departure of the Austrians from the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a> in 1838. The rebellion, however, was quelled and no further serious outbreak occurred for thirteen years. But, amidst all these disturbances in his own kingdom, Gregory had not been free from anxieties for the Faith and the Universal Church. The revolutions in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> had created a difficult situation: the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had been expected by the one party to condemn the change, by the other to accept it. In August, 1831, he issued the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a>, "Sollicitudo Ecclesiarum", in which he reiterated the statements of former Pontiffs as to the independence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and its refusal to be entangled in dynastic politics. In November of the same year, the <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Abb&eacute; de Lamennais</a> and his companions came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to submit to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the questions in dispute between the French episcopate and the directors of "L'Avenir". Gregory received them kindly, but caused them to be given more than one hint that the result of their appeal would not be favourable, and that they would be wise not to press for a decision. In spite, however, of the representations of <a href="../cathen/08733a.htm">Lacordaire</a>, <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> persisted, with the result that, on the feast of the Assumption, 1832, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> issued the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Mirari vos", in which were condemned, not only the policy of "L'Avenir", but also many of the moral and social doctrines that were then put forward by most of the revolutionary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a>, which certainly cannot be considered favourable to <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> that have since become the commonplaces of secular politics, aroused a storm of criticism throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. It is well to remember, however, that some of its adversaries have not read it with great attention, and it has been sometimes criticized for statements that are not to be found in the text. Two years after its publication, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to issue a further <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a>, "Singulari nos", in which he condemned the "Paroles d'un croyant", the reply of <a href="../cathen/08762a.htm">Lamennais</a> to "Mirari vos".

<p>But it was not only in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> that <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> had to be met. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the followers of <a href="../cathen/07276c.htm">Hermes</a> were condemned by the Apostolic Letter, "Dum acerbissima", of 26 September, 1835. And in 1844, near the end of his reign, he issued the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a>, "Inter praecipuas machinationes", against the unscrupulous anti-Catholic propaganda in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> Bible Society and the New York Christian Alliance, which then, as now, were chiefly successful in transforming <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> into crudely anti-clerical <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">free-thinkers</a>. While he was engaged in combating the libertarian movements of current <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> thought, Gregory was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> also to struggle with the rulers of States for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and toleration for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in their realms. In <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> the accession of Queen Maria da Gloria was the occasion of an outburst of anti-clerical legislation. The <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> was commanded to leave the capital and the nunciature was suppressed. All <a href="../cathen/12437a.htm">ecclesiastical privileges</a> were abolished, <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> filled by the ex-king, Dom Miguel, were declared vacant, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> were suppressed. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> protested in consistory, but his protest only led to severer measures, and no efforts on his part were successful until 1841, when the growing popular uneasiness forced the queen to come to terms.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, too, the regent, Queen Maria Cristina, was able, during the minority of her daughter, Queen Isabella, to carry out an anti-clerical programme. In 1835 the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders were suppressed. Then the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> were attacked: twenty-two <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were left without <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were admitted to the committee appointed to "reform the Church", the salaries of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were confiscated. In 1840 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were driven from their sees, and when the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> protested against arbitrary acts of the government in power, he was conducted to the frontier. Peace was not restored to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> till after Gregory's death.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, at the very commencement of his reign, the question of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> was causing trouble. <a href="../cathen/12134a.htm">Pius VIII</a> had dealt with these in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 28 March, 1830. This, however, did not satisfy the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government, and von Bunsen, the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> ambassador, exhausted every means, honest and dishonest, of bringing about a modification of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> policy. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> and the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, Munster, and <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> were induced, in 1834, to enter into a convention not to put into execution the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> legislation. But the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> died the following year, and his successor, <a href="../cathen/05161b.htm">von Droste zu Vischering</a>, was a man of very different calibre. In 1836 the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, feeling his end approach, revealed the whole plot to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Events moved quickly. The new <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> announced his intention of obeying the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and was in consequence <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Government. His arrest caused general indignation throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> endeavoured to justify its action by inventing charges against the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>. Nobody, however, believed the official story, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> and Posen, who had imitated the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> example of his brother of Cologne, was also <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>. But his arbitrary action aroused the indignation of German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and when King Frederick William III died in 1840 his successor was more ready to come to terms. In the end <a href="../cathen/05161b.htm">Archbishop Droste zu Vischering</a> was given a coadjutor, and retired to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a> was released unconditionally and the question at issue was quickly allowed to be decided in favour of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>.

<p>But no such success was possible in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In the former unhappy country the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion was, then as now, inextricably united with the nationalist aspirations. As a consequence the whole force of the Russian autocracy was employed to crush it. With monstrous cruelty the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> Uniats were driven or cajoled into the Orthodox communion, the heroic <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of <a href="../cathen/10333a.htm">Minsk</a> were tortured and enslaved, more than 160 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were deported to Siberia. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the Latin rite were no better treated, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> being <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> deported. Gregory protested in vain, and in 1845, when the Emperor Nicholas visited him in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, rebuked the autocrat for his tyranny. We are told that the Czar made promises of reform in his treatment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but, as might have been expected, nothing was done.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the success of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> revival had been so great that the anti-clericals were infuriated. Pressure was brought to bear upon the Government to obtain the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, always the first to be attacked. M. Guizot sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> <a href="../cathen/13204a.htm">Pellegrino Rossi</a>, a former leader of the revolutionary party in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, to negotiate directly with <a href="../cathen/08760b.htm">Cardinal Lambruschini</a>, who had replaced Bernetti in 1836 as secretary of state. But Gregory and <a href="../cathen/08760b.htm">Lambruschini</a> were both firmly opposed to any attack on the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. <a href="../cathen/13204a.htm">Rossi</a>, therefore, turned his attention to Father Roothan, the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and through the Congregation of Ecclesiastical Affairs, was successful in obtaining a letter to the French <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincials</a> advising that the novitiates and other houses should be gradually diminished or abandoned.

<p>The reign of Gregory was drawing to its close. In August, 1841, with the intention of entering into closer relations with his people, he undertook a tour throughout some of the provinces. He travelled through Umbria to Loreto, thence to Ancona, and on to <a href="../cathen/05744a.htm">Fabriano</a>, where he visited the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Romuald, the founder of the <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a>. He returned by Assisi, <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> and <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>, reaching <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the beginning of October. The progress had cost 2,000,000 francs, but it is very <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether it had the intended result. <a href="../cathen/08760b.htm">Cardinal Lambruschini</a>, to whom the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as he grew older confided more and more of the actual direction of state affairs, was even more arbitrary and less accessible to modern political doctrines than Bernetti; the discontent grew and threatened. In 1843 there were attempts at revolt in Romagna and Umbria, which were suppressed with relentless severity by the special <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, Cardinals Vannicelli and Massimo. In September, 1845, the city of <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a> was again captured by a revolutionary force, which, however, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to retire and seek safety in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. But the impassioned appeals of Niccolini, of <a href="../cathen/06562b.htm">Gioberti</a>, of Farini, of d'Azeglio, were spread throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and the fear was only too well founded that the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a> could not long outlast Gregory XVI. On 20 May, 1846, he felt himself failing, and ordered <a href="../cathen/04488a.htm">Cretineau-Joly</a> to write the history of the <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a>, against which he had struggled vainly. A few days later the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was taken ill with erysipelas in the face. At first the attack was not thought to be serious, but on 31 May his strength suddenly failed, and it was seen that the end was near. He died early on 9 June, with but two attendants near him. His <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, by Amici, is in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>.

<p>Gregory XVI has been treated with but scant respect by later historians, but he has by no means deserved their contempt. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that in political questions he showed himself almost as opposed as his immediate predecessors to even a minimum of democratic progress. But in this he was but similar to most rulers of his time, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> itself, as Bernetti sarcastically remarked, being ready enough to suggest to others reforms it would not try at home. Gregory believed in autocracy, and neither his inclinations nor his experience was such as to make him favourable to increased political freedom. Probably the policy of his predecessors had made it very difficult for any but a very strong <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to oppose the growing revolution by efficient reforms. In any case both his temperament and his policy were such that he left to his successor an almost impossible task. But Gregory was by no means an obscurantist. His interest in art and all forms of learning is attested by the founding of the Etruscan and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> museums at the Vatican, and of the <a href="../cathen/09014a.htm">Christian museum at the Lateran</a>; by the encouragement given to men like Cardinals <a href="../cathen/09538a.htm">Mai</a> and <a href="../cathen/10270b.htm">Mezzofanti</a>, and to Visconti, Salvi, Marchi, <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a>, <a href="../cathen/07583c.htm">Hurter</a>, <a href="../cathen/13117c.htm">Rohrbacher</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07058a.htm">Gu&eacute;ranger</a>; by the lavish aid given to the rebuilding of <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul's Outside-the-Walls</a> and of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> degli Angioli, at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>; by researches encouraged in the Roman Forum and in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>. His care for the social welfare of his people is seen in the tunnelling of Monte Catillo to prevent the devastation of <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a> by the floods of the river Anio, in the establishment of steamboats at <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, of a decimal <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a> in the Roman States, of a bureau of statistics at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in the lightening of various imposts and the re-purchase of the appanage of Eugene Beauharnais, in the foundation of public baths and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphanages</a>. During his reign the losses of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> were more than balanced by her gains in the rest of the world. Gregory sent missionaries to <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinia</a>, to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, to <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, to Polynesia, to the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">North American Indians</a>. He doubled the number of Vicars-Apostolic in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, he increased greatly the number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. During his reign five <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>, thirty-three servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> declared Blessed, many new orders were founded or supported, the <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Immaculate Mother of God</a> increased. In private as in public life, Gregory was noted for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, his kindliness, his simplicity, his firm friendship. He was not, perhaps, a great <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, or fully able to cope with the complicated problems of his time, but to his devotion, his munificence, and his labours <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the Universal Church are indebted for many benefits.
