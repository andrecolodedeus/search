<h1>Pope Honorius II</h1>  

<p>(Lamberto Scannabecchi)

<p>Born of humble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> at Fagnano near Imola at an unknown <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 14 February, 1130. For a time he was <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Bologna. On account of his great learning he was called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Paschal II, became canon at the Lateran, then <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of Santa Prassede, and, in 1117, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia and Velletri</a>. He was one of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who accompanied Gelasius II into exile. In 1119 <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Calistus II</a> sent him as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to Henry V, German Emperor, with powers to come to an understanding concerning the right of investiture. In October of the same year he was present at the <a href="../cathen/12730a.htm">Synod of Reims</a> where the emperor was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a>. A great part of the following three years he spent in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, endeavouring to bring about a reconciliation between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the emperor. It was chiefly through his efforts that the Concordat of Worms, the so-called "Pactum Calixtinum" was effected on 23 September, 1123. In this concordat the emperor renounced all claims to investiture with staff and ring, and promised liberty of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> elections. When the concordat was signed by the emperor, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> sang a solemn high Mass under the open sky near Worms. After the Agnus Dei he <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> the emperor, who then received <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> from the hands of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and was in this manner restored to communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a> died on 13 December, 1124, and two days later the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> was elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, taking the name of Honorius II.

<p>Party spirit between the Frangipani and the Leoni was at its highest during the election and there was great danger of a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> had already elected Cardinal Teobaldo Boccadipecora who had taken the name of <a href="../cathen/03478a.htm">Celestine II</a>. He was clothed in the scarlet mantle of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/14468c.htm">Te Deum</a> was chanted in thanksgiving, when the proud and powerful Roberto Frangipani suddenly appeared on the scene, expressed his dissatisfaction with the election of Teobaldo and proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The intimidated <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> reluctantly yielded to his demand. To prevent a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> Teobaldo resigned his right to the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> however <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> the legality of his election under such circumstances and five days later informed the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> that he wished to resign. Only after all the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> acknowledged him as the legitimate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> could he be prevailed upon to retain the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a>. Soon after Honorius II became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Henry V, the German Emperor, died (23 May, 1125). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at once sent to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> two <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> who, in conjunction with Archbishop Adalbert of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, endeavoured to bring about the election of a king who would not encroach upon the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The subsequent election of Lothair, Count of Supplinburg, was a complete triumph for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The new king acknowledged the supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> even in temporal affairs, and soon after his election asked for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>, which was willingly granted. Concerning investiture he made concessions to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> even beyond the Concordat of Worms. When Conrad of Hohenstaufen rose up in opposition to Lothair and was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> at Monza, by Archbishop Anselm of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, Honorius II <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> as well as Conrad and his adherents, thus completely frustrating Conrad's unlawful aspirations.

<p>Henry I, King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, had for many years encroached on the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and would not allow a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to enter his territory on the plea that <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> had a permanent <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> (<em>legatus natus</em>) in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a> had already experienced difficulties in that line. In 1125 Honorius II sent Cardinal John of <a href="../cathen/04481b.htm">Crema</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> was detained a long time in Normandy by order of Henry I. He was finally permitted to proceed to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He went thence to <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> and met <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">King David</a> at Roxburgh, where he held a synod of Scottish <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to inquire into the controversy between them and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, who claimed to have <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over them. On 8 September he convened a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a> at which the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy of the clergy</a> was enforced and decrees were passed against <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> elections and contracts. On his return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he was accompanied by William, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> who obtained legatine faculties for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> from Honorius II, but was unsuccessful in his attempt to prevail upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to surrender his right of sending special <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. At the request of the King of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, Honorius II also sent a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> thither to put a stop to the abuses of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in that country.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was less successful in his dealings with Count Roger of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, who tried to gain possession of the lands which his deceased cousin William of Apulia had bequeathed to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. Honorius II placed him under the ban and took up arms against him in defence of the lawful <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>, but without avail. To put an end to a useless but costly <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> he made Roger feudatory Lord of Apulia in August, 1128, while Roger in his turn renounced his claims to <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> and <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>. Shortly after his election to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> Honorius II <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Count <a href="../cathen/15642c.htm">William of Normandy</a> for having married a daughter of Fulco of Anjou within the forbidden degree. He likewise restored the disturbed discipline at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Cluny and <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> where the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Abbots Pontius and Orderisius respectively retained possession of their abbatial office by force of arms. On 26 February, 1126, he approved the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian Order</a> which St. Norbert had founded at <a href="../cathen/12392a.htm">Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;</a> six years previously. His letters and diplomas (112 in number) are printed in P.L., CLVI, 1217-1316.
