<h1>Pope Honorius III</h1>  

<p>(Cencio Savelli)

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 18 March, 1227. For a time he was canon at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Maggiore, then he became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chamberlain in 1188 and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal-Deacon</a> of Santa Lucia in Silice in 1193. Under <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Pope Innocent III</a> he became <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of Santi Giovanni et Paolo and, in 1197, tutor of the future <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Emperor Frederick II</a>, who had been given as ward to <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> by the Empress-widow Constantia. On 18 July, 1216, nineteen <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> assembled at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> (where <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent</a> had died two days previously) with the purpose of electing a new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The troublous state of affairs in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the threatening attitude of the Tatars, and the fear of a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, induced the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to agree to an election by compromise. Cardinals Ugolino of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> (afterwards <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>) and Guido of <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Praeneste</a> were empowered to appoint the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Their choice fell upon Cencio Savelli, who accepted the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a> with reluctance and took the name of Honorius III. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> 24 July, was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 31 August, and took possession of the Lateran 3 September. The Roman people were greatly elated at the election, for Honorius III was himself a Roman and by his extreme kindness had endeared himself to the hearts of all.

<p>Though already far advanced in age, his pontificate was one of strenuous activity. Like his famous predecessor Innocent III, he had set his mind on the achievement of two great things, the recovery of the Holy Land and a spiritual reform of the entire Church; but quite in contrast with him he sought these achievements by kindness and indulgence rather than by force and severity. Immediately upon his accession to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne he sent letters to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and the temporal rulers of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in which he admonishes and encourages them to continue in their preparation for the general <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> which, as had been provided at the Lateran Council of 1215, was to be undertaken in 1217. To procure the means <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for this colossal undertaking, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> were to contribute the tenth part, and all other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> the twentieth part, of their income for three years. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> under the supervision of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> in the various countries were entrusted with the collection of these moneys. Honorius III ordered the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> to be preached in all the churches of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. Though the money thus collected was considerable, it was by no means sufficient for a general <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> as planned by Honorius III. Moreover, in preaching the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> the great mistake was made of trying to gather as many <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> as possible, without considering whether they were fit for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>.

<p>The result was that cripples, old men, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, also robbers, thieves, adventurers, and others composed a great part of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>. In some instances the uselessness of such soldiers was not thought of until they had been transported to distant seaports at public expense. Most rulers of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> were engaged in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of their own and could not leave their country for any length of time. Andrew II of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and, somewhat later, a fleet of <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> from the region along the Lower Rhine finally departed for the Holy Land, took Damietta and a few other places in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; but lack of unity among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, also rivalry between the leaders and the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> Pelagius, to some extent perhaps also the incompetency of the latter, resulted in failure.

<p>Honorius III was aware that there was only one man in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> who could bring about the recovery of the Holy Land, and that man was his former pupil <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Like many other rulers, <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> had taken an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to embark for the Holy Land in 1217. As long as his rival <a href="../cathen/11357a.htm">Otto IV</a> was living, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did not urge him to fulfil his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>; when, however, his rival had died on 19 May, 1218, Honorius III insisted that he embark as soon as possible and Frederick promised to set sail for the Holy Land on 24 June, 1219. He then obtained permission to postpone his departure repeatedly, first till 29 September, 1219, then successively till 21 March, 1220, 1 May, 1220, August, 1221, June, 1225, and finally, at the meeting of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the emperor at San Germano on 25 July, 1225, till August, 1227. It must not be ascribed merely to weakness on the part of Honorius III that he allowed one postponement after the other.

<p>He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that without the co-operation of the emperor a successful <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> was impossible and feared that by using harsh measures he would cause a complete break with the emperor and indefinitely destroy the possibility of a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>. For the same reason he yielded to the emperor in many things which under different circumstances he would have strenuously opposed. Thus he reluctantly approved the election of Frederick's son Henry as King of the Romans, which practically united the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> kingdom and the empire in one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>; a union which by its very nature was detrimental to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and which Honorius III had every reason to oppose. Hoping to hasten the departure of Frederick for the Holy Land, he <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> him emperor at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 22 November, 1220. Finally, however, seeing that his extreme indulgence was only abused by the emperor for selfish purposes, he had recourse to severer measures. The emperor's encroachment upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in the appointment of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in Apulia, and his unworthy treatment of King John of Jerusalem, whom Honorius III had appointed governor over part of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> patrimony, brought the tension between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the emperor to its height; but the rupture between the emperor and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> did not take place until Honorius III had died.


<p>Though the general <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> planned by Honorius III was never realized, he deserved the gratitude of the world as the great pacificator of his age. Knowing that the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> was impossible as long as the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes were at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with one another, he began his pontificate by striving to establish peace throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> there was scarcely a city or province at peace with its neighbour. <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself rebelled against the rule of Honorius, so that in June, 1219, he found it advisable to leave the city. He went first to <a href="../cathen/13054a.htm">Rieti</a>, then to <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, returning to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in September, 1220, after the Romans were reconciled to him through the intervention of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, then on his way to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to be <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor. In the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> that followed between the Conti and the Savelli, the Romans sided with the Conti, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, being of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Savelli, was again forced to flee to <a href="../cathen/13054a.htm">Rieti</a> in June, 1225. He returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in January, 1226, after Angelo di Benincasa, a friend of Honorius III, was elected senator of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Through his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Ugolino (afterwards <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>) Honorius effected the reconciliation of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> in 1217, <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a> in 1218, Bologna and Pistoia in 1219, and through his notary Pandulf he prevailed upon the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> to become <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> territory, and upon the cities of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, <a href="../cathen/06124b.htm">Foligno</a>, <a href="../cathen/11086c.htm">Nocera</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10704a.htm">Terni</a>, to restore what had formerly belonged to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was paramount ever since that country had become a fief of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> under Innocent III. The cruel King John had died on 16 October, 1216, leaving his ten- year-old son Henry III as successor. The cruelty and faithlessness of King John may have justified the English barons in rebelling against him and offering the English crown to Louis, the son of King Philip of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but now it became their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to be loyal to the lawful king, Henry III. Honorius III ordered Gualo, his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, to urge the recalcitrant barons to return to their natural allegiance and gave him power to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> all who continued to adhere to Prince Louis of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. On 19 January, 1217, he wrote to William, Earl of <a href="../cathen/11611a.htm">Pembroke</a>, who was the young king's guardian and the regent of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, to prepare for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Prince Louis and the faithless English barons. It was due to the severe measures taken against the barons by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> that peace was finally restored and that Henry III was acknowledged the undisputed King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> on 11 September, 1217. After the death of <a href="../cathen/11611a.htm">Pembroke</a> in May, 1219, the regency of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was nominally in the hands of the king's <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>; actually, however, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> was ruled by Honorius III through Pandulf, who had meanwhile succeeded Gualo as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The influence of Honorius III continued to be paramount in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> during his entire pontificate, for Henry III was still in his minority, and he as well as the barons and the people acknowledged the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as the suzerain of the kingdom.

<p>The untiring activity of Honorius III in the interests of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and peace was felt throughout the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a>. In <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> he safeguarded the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the encroachments of King Ottocar, through his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Gregorius de Crescentio in 1223. In <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> he protected King Andrew II against his rebellious son Bela IV by threatening the latter with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. For <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> he effected in 1224 the liberation of its King Waldemar from the captivity in which he was held by Count Henry of Schwerin. In Sweden he protected the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the encroachments of King John, and urged <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. For the Latin Empire in the Orient he <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Peter of Courtenay as Emperor of Constantinople, in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 12 April, 1217, and protected his successor Robert and King Demetrius of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a> against Theodore Comnenus. In <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> he abated the quarrels between the Greeks and the Latins. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> he effected a lasting peace Between King Ferdinand III and Alfonso IX of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, undertook a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> (1218-1219), and protected the boy-king Jaime of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> against Counts Sancho and Fernando. In <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> he defended Archbishop Estevao Francisco Su&aacute;rez against the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> King Alfonso II (1220-1223). In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> he induced King Louis VIII to undertake a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a> in 1226. He also assisted Bishop Christian of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> in the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussians</a>, and at the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> suggestion called upon the ecclesiastical provinces of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>, <a href="../cathen/09433a.htm">Lund</a>, <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and Camin in 1222 to prepare a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against them.

<p>Honorius III was also a liberal patron of the two great <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> and bestowed numerous privileges upon them. He approved the Rule of St. Dominic in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Religiosam vitam", <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 22 December, 1216, and that of St. Francis in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Solet annuere", <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 29 November, 1223. Many authorities maintain that Honorius III had granted the famous <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Portiuncula indulgence</a> to St. Francis as early as 1216, others hold [Kirsch in "Theologische Quartalschrift", LXXXVIII (T&uuml;bingen, 1906), fasc. 1 and 2] that this <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is of later origin and that the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> which Honorius granted to St. Francis is essentially different from the so-called <a href="../cathen/12286a.htm">Portiuncula indulgence</a>. On 30 January, 1226, he approved the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite Order</a> in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ut vivendi normam". He also approved the religious congregation "Val des Ecoliers" (Vallis scholarium, Valley of scholars), which had been founded by four <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> professors of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> "Exhibita nobis" is <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 7 March, 1219. The congregation was united with that of <a href="../cathen/06413f.htm">St. Genevieve</a> by Innocent X in 1646. It is remarkable that four out the six or seven <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> that were <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by Honorius III were English or <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>. On 17 May, 1218, he <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> William, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> (d. 1209); on 18 February, 1220, Hugh, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Lincoln (d. 1200); on 21 January, 1224, William, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Roschild in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> (d. 1203); on 18 March, 1226, William, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a> (d. 1154).

<p>He also appointed a committee to investigate the alleged <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a> of Cornoet (d. 1191). The latter was never formally <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>, but his cult dates back to the pontificate of Honorius III. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated by the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> on 13 October. Honorius III probably <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> also St. Raynerius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Forconium, now Aquila, in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (d. 1077). Being a man of learning, Honorius insisted that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> should receive a thorough training, especially in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. In the case of a certain Hugh whom the chapter of <a href="../cathen/03635a.htm">Chartres</a> had elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he withheld his <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> because the bishop-elect did not possess sufficient <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, "quum pateretur in litteratura defectum", as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> states in a letter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 8 January, 1219 (Horoy, loc. cit infra, III, 92). Another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he even deprived of his office on account of illiteracy (Raynaldus, <em>ad annum</em> 1221). He bestowed various privileges upon the Universities of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and Bologna, the two greatest seats of learning during those times. In order to facilitate the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> in <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> that were distant from the great centres of learning, he ordered in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Super specula Domini" that some talented young men should be sent to a recognized <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> to study <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> with the purpose of teaching it afterwards in their own <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>.

<p>Honorius III acquired some fame as an author. His letters, many of which are of great historical value, and his other literary productions, were collected and edited by Horoy in "Medii aevi bibliotheca patristica", series I (5 vols., Paris, 1879-83). While he was <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chamberlain (whence his general appellation of Cencius Camerarius) he compiled the "Liber censuum Romanae ecclesiae", perhaps the most valuable source for the history of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> economics during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. It comprises a list of the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, a record of donations received, privileges granted, and contracts made with cities and rulers. It was begun under <a href="../cathen/04018a.htm">Clement III</a> and completed in 1192 under <a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Celestine III</a>. Muratori inserted it in his "Antiquitates Italicae medii aevi", V (Milan, 1739-43), 851-908. A new edition was prepared for the "Bibliotheque des ecoles francaises d'Athene et de <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>" by Fabre and Duchesne, fasc. i (Paris, 1889), fasc. ii and iii (1902), fasc. iv (1903). The original <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the "Liber Censuum", which is still in existence (Vaticanus, 8486), concludes with a catalogue of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiffs</a> and the emperors from St. Peter to <a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Celestine III</a> in 1101. It was edited separately by Weiland in "Archiv der Gesellschaft fur altere deutsche Geschichtskunde", XII (Hanover, 1874), 60-77. Honorius III wrote also a life of <a href="../cathen/03478b.htm">Celestine III</a> (Horoy, loc. cit., I, 567-592); a life of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> (ibid., I, 568-586); an "Ordo Romanus", which is a sort of ceremonial containing the rites of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for various occasions (ibid., I, 35-94, and Mabillon, in "Museum Italicum", II, 167-220); and 34 sermons (Horoy, I, 593-976). His collection of <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> known as "Compilatio quinta" has been treated under <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">DECRETALS</a>.
