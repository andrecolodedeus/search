<h1>Pope Innocent II</h1>  

<p>(Gregorio Papereschi)

<p>Elected 14 Feb., 1130; died 24 Sept., 1143. He was a native of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and belonged to the ancient <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Guidoni. His father's name is given as John.

<p>The youthful Gregory became canon of the Lateran and later <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Sts. Nicholas and Primitivus. He was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal-Deacon</a> of the Title of S. Angelo by <a href="../cathen/11514b.htm">Paschal II</a>, and as such shared the exile of <a href="../cathen/06407a.htm">Gelasius II</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, together with his later rival, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal-Deacon</a> <a href="../cathen/01447a.htm">Pierleone</a>. Under <a href="../cathen/03185a.htm">Callistus II</a> Gregory was sent to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (1119) with the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Lambert, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>. Both were engaged in drawing up the Concordat of Worms in 1122. In the following year he was sent to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>On 14 Feb., 1130, the morning following the death of <a href="../cathen/07456a.htm">Honorius II</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishops</a> held an election and Gregory was chosen as his successor, taking the name of Innocent II; three hours later Pietro Pierleone was elected by the other <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and took the name of <a href="../cathen/01447a.htm">Anacletus II</a>. Both received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> 23 Feb.; Innocent at Santa Maria Nuova and Anacletus at St. Peter's. Finding the influential <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Frangipani had deserted his cause, Innocent at first retired into the stronghold belonging to his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in Trastevere, then went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by way of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. There he secured the support of Louis VI, and in a synod at Etampes the assembled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, influenced by the eloquence of <a href="../cathen/14326a.htm">Suger of St-Denis</a>, acknowledged his authority. This was also done by other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> gathered at Puy-en-Velay through <a href="../cathen/07515b.htm">St. Hugh</a> of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> went to the Abbey of Cluny, then attended another meeting of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, November, 1130, at <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a>; they also promised obedience and enacted a number of disciplinary canons.

<p>Through the activity of <a href="../cathen/11100b.htm">St. Norbert of Magdeburg</a>, Conrad of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>, the election of Innocent was ratified at a synod assembled at <a href="../cathen/15718a.htm">W&uuml;rzburg</a> at the request of the German king, and here the king and his princes promised allegiance. A personal meeting of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and king took place 22 March, 1131, at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, where a week later Innocent solemnly <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> King Lothair and Queen Richenza in the church of <a href="../cathen/08757a.htm">St. Lambert</a>. He celebrated <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1131, at St-Denis in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and 18 October opened the great synod at <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> the young prince of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, later Louis VII. At this synod <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> were represented; <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> and St. Norbert attended and several salutary canons were enacted. Pentecost, 1132, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> held a synod at <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>. The following year he again entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and on 4 June <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Lothair emperor at the Lateran. In 1134 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, at the request of the emperor, ordered that <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Sweden</a>, <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, and the island of Greenland should remain under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a> (Weiss, "Weltgeschichte", V, 21). On the departure of the emperor, innocent also left and went to <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> still held sway in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> a great synod was held in 1135 (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, "Conciliengeschichte", V, 425) at which were present <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, etc. In the spring of 1137 Emperor Lothair, in answer to the repeated entreaties of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, began his march to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> and imperial troops met at <a href="../cathen/02295a.htm">Bari</a>, 30 May, 1137, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was again conducted into <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Anacletus still held a part of the city, but died 25 Jan., 1138. Another <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> was chosen, who called himself <a href="../cathen/15411a.htm">Victor IV</a>, but he, urged especially by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of St. Bernard, soon submitted, and Innocent found himself in undisturbed possession of the city and of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>.

<p>To remove the remnants and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> consequences of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, Innocent II called the <a href="../cathen/09017a.htm">Tenth Ecumenical Council</a>, the Second of the Lateran. It began its sessions on 4 April, 1139 (not 8 April, as Hefele writes, V, 438). One thousand <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and other <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> are said to have been present. The official acts of <a href="../cathen/01447a.htm">Anacletus II</a> were declared null and void, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by him were with few exceptions deposed, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> tenets of Pierre de Bruys were condemned. Thirty canons were made against <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, incontinence, extravagance in dress among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, etc. Sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> was pronounced upon Roger, who styled himself King of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and who after the departure of the emperor had invaded the lands granted to Rainulph. In 1139 <a href="../cathen/09565a.htm">St. Malachy</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>, left <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to visit the shrine of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. Innocent received him with great honours and made him <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> for all <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, but would not grant him permission to resign his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in order to join the community of St. Bernard at <a href="../cathen/03798c.htm">Clairvaux</a> (Bellesheim, "Ireland", I, 356). In the East, Innocent II curbed the pretension to independence on the part of William, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and of Raoul, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> (Hergenr&ouml;ther, II, 410).

<p>After the death of Alberic, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, in 1141, Louis VII of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> wanted to secure the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of a man of his own choice whom the chapter did not consider the fit <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and they chose Pierre de La Ch&acirc;tre, whereupon Louis refused to ratify the election. The bishop-elect in person brought the matter to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and Innocent, finding after due examination that the election had been made according to the requirements of ecclesiastical law, Confirmed it and himself gave the episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. When Pierre returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Louis would not allow him to enter his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. After useless negotiations Innocent placed <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>. Only during the reign of the next <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> removed and peace restored.

<p>In the trouble between Alfonso of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and Alfonso Henr&iacute;quez who was making <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> an independent monarchy and had placed his kingdom under the protection of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, Innocent acted as mediator (<a href="../cathen/01773a.htm">Aschbach</a>, "Gesch. Span. u. Port.", 1833, 304, 458). Ramiro II, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, had been elected King of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. Innocent II is said to have given him <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, though others claim that this is a <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> spread by the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (<a href="../cathen/04614b.htm">Damberger</a>, "Weltgeschichte", VIII, 202).

<p>Several minor <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were held during the last few years of the life of Innocent, one at <a href="../cathen/13716a.htm">Sens</a> in 1140, at Vienne in 1141 and in the same year at Vienne and <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>; in 1142 at Lagny, in which Ralph, the Duke of Vermandois is said to have been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> <a href="../cathen/08257a.htm">Yvo of Chartres</a> for having repudiated his lawful wife and married another (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, V, 488). A synod was held under the presidency of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> 7 April, 1141, at <a href="../cathen/15649c.htm">Winchester</a>; and 7 Dec., 1141, at <a href="../cathen/15598a.htm">Westminster</a>. During his pontificate Innocent II enrolled among the Canonized <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> in 1133, St. Godehard, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>; at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> in 1134, St. Hugo, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07026b.htm">Grenoble</a>, who had died in 1132, and had been a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> defender of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of Innocent; at the Lateran in 1139, St. Sturmius, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a> (Ann. Pont. Cath., 1903, 412). To St. Norbert, the founder of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>, he granted in 1131 a document authorizing him to introduce his rule at the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> (Heimbucher, "Die Orden u. Congr.", II, <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>, 1907, 55); to St. Bernard he in 1140 gave the church of Sts. Vincent and Anastasius near <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (ibid., 1, 428); he also granted many privileges to others. His letters and privileges are given in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a> (P.L., CLXXIX). According to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (ed. Duchesne, II, 379) he <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> eighteen <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, twenty <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and seventy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p>He was buried in St. John Lateran, but seven years later was transferred to Santa Maria in Trastevere. Innocent II is praised by all, especially by St. Bernard, as a man of irreproachable character. His motto was: "Adjuva nos, Deus salutaris noster". The policy of Innocent is characterized in one of his letters: "If the sacred authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and the imperial power are imbued with mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, we must thank <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in all <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, since then only can peace and harmony exist among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> peoples. For there is nothing so sublime as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> nor so exalted as the imperial throne" (Weiss, V, 25).
