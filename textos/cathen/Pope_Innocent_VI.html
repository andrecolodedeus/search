<h1>Pope Innocent VI</h1>  

<p>(ETIENNE AUBERT)

<p>Born at Mont in the <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Diocese of Limoges</a> (<a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>); elected at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, 18 December 1352; died there, 12 September, 1362. He began his career as professor of <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> where he subsequently rose to the highest judicial position. Having entered the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a> he became successively <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Noyon (1338), of <a href="../cathen/04053a.htm">Clermont</a> (1340), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a> (1342), <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, and Grand Penitentiary (1352). The <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> which elected him to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> is remarkable for the fact that the first certain election capitulation was framed by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> present, each of whom bound himself to divide, in case of election, his power and revenues with the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a>. Aubert took this engagement but with the restriction; "in so far as it was not contrary to church law". When the choice fell on him, one of his first pontifical acts declared the pact illegal and null, because it contained a limitation of the Divinely conferred <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power. The new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> also gave immediate <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the thoroughly <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> spirit which was to animate his policy. Shortly after his <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> the numerous <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> who had flocked to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> in search of preferment received a peremptory order to repair, under penalty of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, to their respective places of residence. Some appointments to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> made by his predecessor were repealed, numerous reservations abolished, and pluralities disapproved. Luxury was banished from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court and the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of following this example set by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> imposed upon the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. To the auditors of the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a>, whose services were gratuitous, a fixed income was assigned in the interest of a more impartial administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. As the territory of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a> had been usurped by petty princes, Innocent VI sent Cardinal Gil de Albornoz (q.v.) to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> with unlimited power. Success on the battle-field and diplomatic skill enabled this <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to restore <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>.

<p>Pope Innocent viewed favourably the imperial <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of the German king, Charles IV, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but at the same time exacted from him a solemn pledge that be would leave <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the very day on which the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> would take place. Charles was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a>, 1355, by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> and faithfully observed his promise. The following year he issued the celebrated "Golden Bull", against which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> protested because it silently passed over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> claims to confirm the German kings and to administer the empire during a vacancy. Objection was also made in 1359 to the emperor's resolution to undertake a reform of the German <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> independently of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; Charles's reformatory plans, however, subsequently received <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>. The mutual peaceful dispositions prevented any conflict of a serious character. Innocent VI sought to terminate the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and finally through his intervention the Peace of Br&eacute;tigny was concluded in 1360. To protect the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> residence against the bands of freebooters that were then devastating <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Innocent increased the fortifications of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>; but before these were completed he was attacked and constrained to buy off his assailants by an enormous ransom. He used with but little success the severest <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> penalties against Peter I of Castile (1350-69), who had repudiated and poisoned his wife and is deservedly known as "the Cruel". His efforts to restore peace between <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile and Aragon</a> were fruitless, so also his plans for a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> and for the reunion of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At the request of Emperor Charles IV he instituted (1354) for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> the feast of the Holy Lance and Nails (<em>Lance&#aelig; et Clavorum</em>). He renewed the previous privileges of the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a>, then in conflict with Richard Fitzralph, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01729a.htm">Armagh</a>. Although tainted with nepotism he ranks among the best of the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. His patronage of arts and his moral integrity are generally recognized.
