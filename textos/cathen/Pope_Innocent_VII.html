<h1>Pope Innocent VII</h1>  

<p>(Cosimo de' Migliorati)

<p>Born of humble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> at Sulmona, in the Abruzzi, about 1336; died 6 November, 1406. He studied at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, <a href="../cathen/11385b.htm">Padua</a>, and finally at Bologna, where he graduated under the famous jurist Lignano. After teaching <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> and Padua for some time, he accompanied his former professor, Lignano, to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was received into the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> by <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> (1378-89). Shortly after his arrival in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban</a> sent him as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> collector to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he remained about ten years. Upon his return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Bologna in 1386, and on 5 December, 1387, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. The latter see he held until 15 September, 1400. In 1389, <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, and sent him as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> and <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> in 1390. He was universally esteemed for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and learning, and was an able manager of financial affairs. On 17 October, 1404, he was elected and took the name of Innocent VII. His reign fell in the time of the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>; the rival <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> (1394-1423). Previous to his election, Innocent VII, like the other <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, had taken the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to leave nothing undone, if needs be even to lay down the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a>, in order to terminate the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. Shortly after his <a href="../cathen/01095a.htm">accession</a> he took steps to keep his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> by proclaiming a council, but the disturbances which occurred in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> brought the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> good <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intentions</a> to naught. The revolutionary element among the Romans rose up against the temporal authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and King Ladislaus of Naples hastened to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to assist the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in suppressing the insurrection. For his services the king extorted various concessions from Innocent, among them the promise that he would not make any agreement with the rival <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> without stipulating that the king's <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> should remain intact. Not content with these concessions, which Innocent made for the sake of peace, Ladislaus desired to extend his rule over <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> territory. To attain his end he aided the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> faction in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in their revolutionary attempts in 1405. Innocent had made the great mistake of elevating his unworthy nephew, Ludovico Migliorati, to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>. This <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">act</a> of nepotism is the one blemish in the short reign of the otherwise <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. But it cost him dear. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, angered because the Romans rebelled against his uncle, waylaid a few of the most influential among them on their return from a conference with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and had them brought to his house in order to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> them. The people were highly incensed at this cruel deed, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had to flee for his life, although he was in no way responsible for his nephew's crime. He took up his abode in <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> until the Romans requested him to return in 1406. They again acknowledged his authority, but a squad of troops which King Ladislaus of Naples had sent to the aid of <a href="../cathen/04125c.htm">Colonna</a> was still occupying the Castle of Sant' Angelo and made frequent sorties upon <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the neighbouring territory. Only after Ladislaus was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> did he yield to the demands of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and withdraw his troops. In the midst of these political disturbances Innocent neglected what was then most <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essential</a> for the well-being of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. His rival, <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, made it appear that the only obstacle to the termination of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was the unwillingness of Innocent VII. The reasons why Innocent did practically nothing for the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> were: the troubled state of affairs in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, his mistrust in the sincerity of <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, and the hostile attitude of King Ladislaus of Naples. Shortly before his death he planned the restoration of the Roman University, but his death brought the movement to a standstill.
