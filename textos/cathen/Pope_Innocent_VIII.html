<h1>Pope Innocent VIII</h1>  

<p>(Giovanni Battista Cib&ograve;)

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, 1432; elected 29 August, 1484; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 25 July, 1492. He was the son of the Roman senator, Aran Cib&ograve;, and Teodorina de' Mari. After a licentious youth, during which he had two <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> children, Franceschetto and Teodorina, he took orders and entered the service of Cardinal Calandrini. He was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13489c.htm">Savona</a> in 1467, but exchanged this see in 1472 for that of <a href="../cathen/10434a.htm">Molfetta</a> in south-eastern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and was raised to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> the following year. At the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1484, he signed, like all the other <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> present, the election capitulation which was to bind the future <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Its primary object was to safeguard the personal interests of the electors. The choice fell on Cib&ograve; himself who, in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of his countryman, Innocent IV, assumed the name of Innocent VIII. His success in the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, as well as his promotion to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, was largely due to Giuliano della Rovere. The chief concern of the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, whose kindliness is universally praised, was the promotion of peace among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes, though he himself became involved in difficulties with King Ferrante of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. The protracted conflict with <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> was the principal obstacle to a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>; Innocent VIII earnestly endeavoured to unite <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> against the common enemy. The circumstances appeared particularly favourable, as Prince Djem, the Sultan's brother and pretender to the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> throne, was held <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and promised co-operation in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and withdrawal of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> from <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in case of success. A congress of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes met in 1490 at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but led to no result. On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had the satisfaction of witnessing the fall of <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a> (1491) which <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> the reconquest of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> and earned for the King of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the title of "Catholic Majesty". In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> he proclaimed the right of King Henry VII and his descendants to the English throne and also agreed to some modifications affecting the privilege of "sanctuary". The only <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> which he proclaimed was that of Margrave Leopold of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> (6 Jan., 1485). He issued an appeal for a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldenses</a>, actively opposed the Hussite <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, and forbade (Dec., 1486) under penalty of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> the reading of the nine hundred theses which Pico della Mirandola had publicly posted in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On 5 Dec., 1484, he issued his much-abused <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> against <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witchcraft</a>, and 31 May, 1492, he solemnly received at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="../cathen/08773a.htm">Holy Lance</a> which the Sultan surrendered to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Constantly confronted with a depleted treasury, he resorted to the objectionable expedient of creating new offices and granting them to the highest bidders. Insecurity reigned at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> during his rule owing to insufficient punishment of crime. However, he dealt mercilessly with a band of unscrupulous officials who forged and sold <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a>; capital punishment was meted out to two of the culprits in 1489. Among these forgeries must be relegated the alleged permission granted the <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norwegians</a> to celebrate <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> without wine. See "Bullarium Romanum", III, iii (Rome, 1743), 190-225.
