<h1>Pope Innocent X</h1>  

<p>(Giambattista Pamfili)

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 6 May, 1574; died there, 7 January, 1655. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were Camillo Pamfili and Flaminia de Bubalis. The Pamfili resided originally at <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a>, in Umbria, but came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>. The young man studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> at the Collegio Romano and graduated as bachelor of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> at the age of twenty. Soon afterwards <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> appointed him consistorial advocate and auditor of the <a href="../cathen/13205c.htm">Rota</a>. <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> made him <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> sent him as datary with the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, Francesco Barberini, to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, then appointed him titular Latin <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. He was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of Sant' Eusebio on 30 August, 1626, though he did not assume the purple until 19 November, 1629. He was a member of the congregations of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, and Jurisdiction and Immunity. On 9 August, 1644, a <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> was held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the election of a successor to <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> was a stormy one. The French faction had agreed to give their vote to no candidate who was friendly towards <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Cardinal Firenzola, the Spanish candidate was, therefore, rejected, being a known enemy of <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Cardinal Mazarin</a>, prime minister of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Fearing the election of an avowed enemy of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the French party finally agreed with the Spanish party upon Pamfili, although his sympathy for <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> was well known. On 15 September he was elected, and ascended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne as Innocent X.

<p>Soon after his accession, Innocent found it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to take legal action against the Barberini for misappropriation of public moneys. To escape punishment Antonio and Francesco Barberini fled to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where they found a powerful protector in <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a>. Innocent confiscated their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and on 19 February, 1646, issued a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> ordaining that all <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who had left or should leave the Ecclesiastical States without <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> permission and should not return within six months, should be deprived of their <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> and eventually of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> itself. The French Parliament declared the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> ordinances null and void, but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did not yield until <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a> prepared to send troops to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to invade the Ecclesiastical States. Henceforth the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> policy towards <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> became more friendly, and somewhat later the Barberini were rehabilitated. But when in 1652 <a href="../cathen/12797a.htm">Cardinal Retz</a> was arrested by <a href="../cathen/10092a.htm">Mazarin</a>, Innocent solemnly protested against this act of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> committed against a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and protected Retz after his escape in 1654. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> Innocent had occasion to assert his authority as suzerain over Duke Ranuccio II of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> who refused to redeem the bonds (<em>monti</em>) of the Farnesi from the Roman creditors, as had been stipulated in the Treaty of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> on 31 March, 1644. The duke, moreover, refused to recognize Cristoforo Guarda, whom the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Castro. When, therefore, the new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> while on his way to take possession of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, Innocent held Ranuccio responsible for the crime. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> took possession of Castro, razed it to the ground and transferred the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> to <a href="../cathen/01109a.htm">Acquapendente</a>. The duke was forced to resign the administration of his district to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who undertook to satisfy the creditors. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> relations with <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, which had been highly strained during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a>, became very friendly during Innocent's reign. Innocent aided the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> financially against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> in the struggle for Candia, while the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> on their part allowed Innocent free scope in filling the vacant <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> in their territory, a right which they had previously claimed for themselves. In <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> the popular insurrection of 1640 had led to the secession of that country from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and to the election of Juan IV of Braganza as King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. Both <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> and Innocent X, in deference to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, refused to acknowledge the new king and withheld their <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> nominated by him. Thus it happened that towards the end of Innocent's pontificate there was only one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the whole of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. On 26 November, 1648, Innocent issued the famous <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Zelo domus Dei", in which he declares as null and void those articles of the Peace of <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a> which were detrimental to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. In his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Cum occasione", issued on 31 May, 1653. he condemned five propositions taken from the "Augustinus" of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a>, thus giving the impulse to the great <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> controversy in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>.

<p>Innocent X was a lover of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and his life was blameless; he was, however, often irresolute and suspicious. The great blemish in his pontificate was his dependence on Donna Olimpia Maidalchini, the wife of his deceased brother. For a short time her influence had to yield to that of the youthful Camillo Astalli, a distant relative of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, whom Innocent raised to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> seemed to be unable to get along without her, and at her instance Astalli was deprived of the purple and removed from the Vatican. The accusation, made by Gualdus (Leti) in his "Vita di Donna Olimpia Maidalchini" (1666), that Innocent's relation to her was immoral, has been rejected as <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> by all reputable historians.
