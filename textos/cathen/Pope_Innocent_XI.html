<h1>Pope Innocent XI</h1>  

<p>(Benedetto Odescalchi)

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/04183a.htm">Como</a>, 16 May, 1611; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 11 August, 1689. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> at <a href="../cathen/04183a.htm">Como</a>, and studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> appointed him successively prothonotary, president of the Apostolic Camera, commissary at <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, administrator of <a href="../cathen/09492a.htm">Macerata</a>, and Governor of Picena. <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> made him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal-Deacon</a> of Santi Cosma e Damiano on 6 March, 1645, and, somewhat later, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of Sant' Onofrio. As <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> he was beloved by all on account of his deep <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, charity, and unselfish devotion to <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. When he was sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> in order to assist the people stricken with a severe famine, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> introduced him to the people of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> as the "father of the poor", "Mittimus patrem pauperum". In 1650 he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a>, in which capacity he spent all the revenues of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> to relieve the poor and sick in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. With the permission of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> he resigned as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a> in favour of his brother Giulio in 1656 and went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he took a prominent part in the consultations of the various congregations of which he was a member.

<p>He was a strong candidate for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> after the death of <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">Clement IX</a> on 9 December, 1669, but the French Government rejected him. After the death of <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a>, <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">King Louis XIV of France</a> again intended to use his royal influence against the election of Odescalchi, but, seeing that the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> as well as the Roman people were of one mind in their desire to have Odescalchi as their <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he reluctantly instructed the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the French party to acquiesce in his candidacy. After an interregnum of two months, Odescalchi was unanimously elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on 21 September, 1676, and took the name of Innocent XI. Immediately upon his accession he turned all his efforts towards reducing the expenses of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>. He passed strict ordinances against nepotism among the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. He lived very parsimoniously and exhorted the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to do the same. In this manner he not only squared the annual deficit which at his accession had reached the sum of 170,000 <em>scudi</em>, but within a few years the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> income was even in excess of the expenditures.

<p>The whole pontificate of Innocent XI is marked by a continuous struggle with the absolutism of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">King Louis XIV of France</a>. As early as 1673 the king had by his own power extended the right of the <em>r&eacute;gale</em> over the provinces of Languedoc, Guyenne, Provence, and Dauphin&eacute;, where it had previously not been exercised, although the Council of Lyons in 1274 had forbidden under pain of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> to extend the r&eacute;gale beyond those districts where it was then in force. Bishops <a href="../cathen/11594a.htm">Pavillon</a> of Alet and <a href="../cathen/03458b.htm">Caulet</a> of <a href="../cathen/11435b.htm">Pamiers</a> protested against this royal encroachment and in consequence they were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the king. All the efforts of Innocent XI to induce <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">King Louis</a> to respect the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were useless. In 1682, <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> convoked an Assembly of the French Clergy which, on 19 March, adopted the four famous articles, known as "D&eacute;claration du clerg&eacute; fran&ccedil;ais" (see <a href="../cathen/06351a.htm">GALLICANISM</a>). Innocent annulled the four articles in his <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> of 11 April, 1682, and refused his <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> to all future episcopal candidates who had taken part in the assembly. To appease the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> began to pose as a zealot of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. In 1685 he revoked the Edict of Nantes and inaugurated a cruel <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. Innocent XI expressed his displeasure at these drastic measures and continued to withhold his <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> from the episcopal candidates as he had done heretofore. He irritated the king still more by abolishing the much abused "right of asylum" in a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 7 May, 1685. By force of this right the foreign ambassadors at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had been able to harbour in their palaces and the immediate neighbourhood any criminal that was wanted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Innocent XI notified the new French ambassador, Marquis de Lavardin, that he would not be recognized as ambassador in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> unless he renounced this right. But <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> would not give it up. At the head of an armed force of about 800 men Lavardin entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in November, 1687, and took forcible possession of his palace. Innocent XI treated him as <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and placed under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Louis at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where he attended services on 24 December, 1687.

<p>The tension between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the king was still increased by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> procedure in filling the vacant archiepiscopal See of Cologne. The two candidates for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> were Cardinal Wilhelm F&uuml;rstenberg, then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, and Joseph Clement, a brother of Max Emanuel, Elector of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. The former was a willing tool in the hands of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, and his appointment as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> and Elector of Cologne would have implied French preponderance in north-western <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Joseph Clement was not only the candidate of Emperor Leopold I of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> but of all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> rulers, with the exception of the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and his servile supporter, King James II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. At the election, which took place on 19 July, 1688, neither of the candidates received the required number of votes. The decision, therefore, fell to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who designated Joseph Clement as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> and Elector of Cologne. <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> retaliated by taking possession of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> territory of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, imprisoning the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> and appealing to a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. Nor did he conceal his intention to separate the French Church entirely from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> remained firm. The subsequent fall of James II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> destroyed French preponderance in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and soon after Innocent's death the struggle between <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> was settled in favour of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Innocent XI did not approve the imprudent manner in which James II attempted to restore <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He also repeatedly expressed his displeasure at the support which James II gave to the autocratic <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">King Louis XIV</a> in his measures hostile to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is, therefore, not surprising that Innocent XI had little sympathy for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and that he did not assist him in his hour of trial. There is, however, no ground for the accusation that Innocent XI was informed of the designs which William of Orange had upon <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, much less that he supported him in the overthrow of James II. It was due to Innocent's earnest and incessant exhortations that the German Estates and <a href="../cathen/14061c.htm">King John Sobieski</a> of <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> in 1683 hastened to the relief of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> which was being besieged by the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. After the siege was raised, Innocent again spared no efforts to induce the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes to lend a helping hand for the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> from <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. He contributed millions of <em>scudi</em> to the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> fund in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and had the satisfaction of surviving the capture of <a href="../cathen/02407a.htm">Belgrade</a>, 6 Sept., 1688.

<p>Innocent XI was no less intent on preserving the purity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. He insisted on a thorough <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and an exemplary life of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, reformed the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, passed strict ordinances concerning the modesty of dress among Roman ladies, put an end to the ever increasing passion for gambling by suppressing the gambling houses at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 12 February, 1679, encouraged frequent and even daily Communion. In his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Sanctissimnus Dominus", issued on 2 March, 1679, he condemned sixty-five propositions which favoured laxism in <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, and in a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 26 June, 1680, he defended the Probabiliorism of Thyrsus Gonz&aacute;lez, S.J. This <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> (see authentic text in "Etudes religieuses", XCI, Paris, 1902, 847 sq.) gave rise to the controversy, whether Innocent XI intended it as a condemnation of <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> Francis Ter Haar, in his work: "Ben. Innocentii PP. XI de probabilismo decreti historia" (Tournai, 1904), holds that the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> is opposed to <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>, while August Lehmkuhl, S.J., in his treatise: "Probabilismus vindicatus" (Freiburg, 1906), 78-111, defends the opposite opinion. In a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 28 August, 1687, and in the Constitution "C&oelig;lestis Pastor" of 19 November, 1687, Innocent XI condemned sixty-eight <a href="../cathen/12608c.htm">Quietistic</a> propositions (see <a href="../cathen/12608c.htm">QUIETISM</a>) of Miguel de Molinos. Towards the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a> Innocent XI was lenient, though he by no means espoused their doctrines. The process of his <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> was introduced by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> and continued by <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> and <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a>, but French influence and the accusation of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> caused it to be dropped. His "Epistol&aelig; ad Principes" were published by Berthier (2 vols., Rome, 1891-5), and his "Epistol&aelig; ad Pontifices", by Bonamico (Rome, 1891).
