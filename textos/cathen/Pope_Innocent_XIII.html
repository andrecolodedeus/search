<h1>Pope Innocent XIII</h1>  

<p>(Michelangelo Dei Conti)

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 13 May, 1655; died at the same place, 7 March, 1724. He was the son of Carlo II, Duke of Poli. After studying at the Roman College he was introduced into the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> by <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Alexander VIII</a>, who in 1690 commissioned him to bear the blessed hat (<em>berettone</em>) and sword (<em>stocco</em>) to Doge Morosini of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. In 1695 he was made Titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a> and <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/09406b.htm">Lucerne</a>, and in 1697, <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>. <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of Santi Quirico e Giulitta on 17 May, 1706, conferred on him the <a href="../cathen/11338a.htm">Diocese of Osimo</a> in 1709, and that of <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> in 1712. Sickness compelled him to resign his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in 1719. After the death of <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> he was elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in a stormy <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> on 8 May, 1721. In memory of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, to whose lineage he belonged, he chose the name of Innocent XIII. Soon after his succession he invested Emperor Charles VI with the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Kingdom of Sicily</a> and received his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance in 1722. When, a year later, the emperor invested the Spanish prince Don Carlos, with <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> and <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> protested on the ground that these two duchies were under <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> suzerainty. His protests, however, remained unheeded. Like his predecessor, be gave an annual pension to the English Pretender, James III, the son of the dethroned <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> King, James II, and even promised to aid him with 100,000 ducats, in case an opportunity should offer itself to regain the English Crown by force of arms. He also assisted the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> and especially the Island of Malta in their struggle against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. In the dispute of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and others, concerning the retention of various Chinese Rites among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> converts of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, Innocent XIII sided with the opponents of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. When in 1721 seven <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> sent a document to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> containing a petition to suppress the Constitution <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a> in which <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> had condemned the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>, Innocent XIII not only condemned the writing of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but also demanded unconditional submission to the Constitution. He was, however, weak enough to yield to French pressure and raise the unworthy Prime Minister Dubois to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>. He, indeed, exhorted the minister to change his wicked life, but his exhortations remained useless. (For a milder view of Dubois see Bliard, "Dubois, cardinal et premier ministre", Paris, 1901.) In a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of March, 1723, he regulated numerous abuses in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and was assisted in the execution of this <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> by King Philip V of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The fears which were raised in the beginning of his pontificate that he would yield to nepotism were entirely groundless. He elevated his brother to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>, but did not allow his revenues to exceed 12,000 <em>scudi</em> as had been stipulated by <a href="../cathen/08022a.htm">Pope Innocent XII</a>.
