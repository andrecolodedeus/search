<h1>Pope John II</h1>  

<p>(533-535).

<p>The date of the birth of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is not known. He was a Roman and the son of Projectus; if not born in the second region (<em>Coelimontium</em>) he had at least been a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of St. Clement's Basilica on the slope of Mons Coelius. He seems to have been the first who changed his name on being raised to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> (2 Jan., 533). The basilica of St. Clement still retains several memorials of "Johannes surnamed Mercurius". <em>Presbyter Mercurius</em> is found on a fragment of an ancient <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a>, and several of the marble slabs which enclose the <em>schola cantorum</em> bear upon them, in the style of the sixth century, the monogram of <em>Johannes</em>. At this period <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> in the election of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was rife among <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. After the death of the predecessor of John II there was a vacancy of over two months, and during that period shameless trafficking in sacred things was indulged in. Even <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> were exposed for sale. The matter was brought before the Senate, and before the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogothic</a> Court at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. As a result the last <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> (<em>Senatus Consultum</em>) which the Senate of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is known to have issued, and which, passed under <a href="../cathen/02660a.htm">Boniface II</a>, was directed against <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> in papal elections, was confirmed by the Gothic King Athalaric. He ordered it to be engraved on marble, and to be placed in the atrium of St. Peter's (533). By one of Athalaric's own additions to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, it was decided, that if a disputed election was carried before the Gothic officials of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> by the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people, three thousand solidi would have to be paid into court. This sum was to be given to the poor. John himself, however, always remained on good terms with Athalaric, who referred to his tribunal all actions brought against the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Justinian also showed his good will to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">See of Rome</a> in John's <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. He sent him his profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and many valuable presents. Some time before John became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the East was agitated by the formula, "One of the Trinity has been crucified", which had been put forward as a means of reconciling various <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. Condemned by Pope Hormisdas, the formula fell out of use. Afterwards revived, it was in a modified form defended by <a href="../cathen/08578b.htm">Justinian</a>, and opposed by the Acoemet&aelig;, or sleepless <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. But they were condemned by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> who informed the emperor of his action (24 March, 534). The crimes of Contumeliosus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Riez, in Provence, caused John to order the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gaul to confine him in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Till a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should be appointed he bade the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Riez obey the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles. Two hundred and seventeen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled in council at Carthage (535) submitted to John II the question as to whether <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had lapsed into <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> should, on repentance keep their rank or be admitted to lay communion. The answer to their question was given by Agapetus, as John II died 8 May, 535. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>.
