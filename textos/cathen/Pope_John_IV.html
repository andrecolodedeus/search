<h1>Pope John IV</h1>  

<p>(640-642).

<p>A native of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a>, and the son of the <em>scholasticus</em> (advocate) Venantius. The date of his birth is uncertain; d. 12 October, 642. At the time of his election he was <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. As John's <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> followed very soon after his election, it is supposed that the papal elections were now confirmed by the exarchs resident at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. Troubles in his native land, caused by invasions of <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, directed John's attention there. To alleviate the distress of the inhabitants, John sent the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> Martin into <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> and Istria with large sums of money for the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of captives. As the ruined churches could not be rebuilt, the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of some of the more important Dalmatian <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were brought to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. John erected an oratory in their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which still stands. It was adorned by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> depicting John himself holding in his hands a model of his oratory. John apparently did not content himself with palliating the evils wrought by the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>. He endeavoured to convert these barbarians. <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> Porphyrogenitus says that Porga, a prince of the Croats who had been invited into <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> by Heraclius I, sent to an Emperor Heraclius for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teachers. It is supposed that the emperor to whom this message was sent was Heraclius I himself, and that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to whom he sent was John IV.

<p>While still only <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>-elect, John, with the other rulers of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, wrote to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the North of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> to tell them of the mistakes they were making with regard to the <a href="../cathen/05228a.htm">time of keeping Easter</a>, and exhorting them to be on their guard against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. About the same time he condemned <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelism</a>. Emperor Heraclius immediately disowned the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite</a> document known as the "Ecthesis". To his son, Constantine III, John addressed his apology for Pope Honorius, in which he deprecated the attempt to connect the name of Honorius with <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelism</a>. Honorius, he declared, in speaking of one will in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, only meant to assert that there were not two contrary wills in Him. John was buried in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>.
