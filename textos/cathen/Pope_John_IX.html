<h1>Pope John IX</h1>  

<p>(898-900).

<p>Not only is the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of John's birth unknown, but the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his election as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and that of his death are alike uncertain. He became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the early part of 898, and died in the beginning of the year 900. He was a native of <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>, and the son of Rampoald. Becoming a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Pope Formosus. At this period factions filled the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and one of them tried to force their candidate, Sergius, afterwards <a href="../cathen/13729a.htm">Sergius III</a>, on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne in opposition to John. Perhaps because he was favoured by the ducal House of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, John was able to maintain his position, and <a href="../cathen/13729a.htm">Sergius</a> was driven from the city and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. With a view to diminish the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of faction in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, John, who is acknowledged to have been both intelligent and moderate, held several <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and elsewhere (898). In them the ghastly synod of <a href="../cathen/14289d.htm">Stephen (VI) VII</a> was condemned, and its Acts were burnt. Re-ordinations were forbidden, and those of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who had been degraded by <a href="../cathen/14289d.htm">Stephen</a> were restored to the ranks from which he had deposed them. The barbarous custom of plundering the palaces of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> on their death was ordered to be put down both by the spiritual and temporal authorities. The Synod of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> also declared itself for Emperor Lambert and against his rival B&eacute;renger, and at the same time decided that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>-elect was not to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> except in the presence of the imperial envoys. This canon was decreed in the hope that it might lessen the evils caused by the Roman factions. A synod which John held at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> decreed that steps should be taken to put an end to the deeds of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> which were being perpetrated everywhere. To keep their independence, which was threatened by the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> of Moravia appealed to John to let them have a <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of their own. Not heeding the hectoring letters with which some of the German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> endeavoured to dissuade him from hearkening to the Moravians, John sanctioned the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Moravians. On John's <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> the name of the emperor (Lambert) figures along with his own. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> just outside St. Peter's.
