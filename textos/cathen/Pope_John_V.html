<h1>Pope John V</h1>  

<p>(685-686).

<p>A Syrian whose father was one Cyriacus; when he was born is not known; d. 2 August, 686. As a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> he was one of those who represented the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> at the Sixth Oecumenical Council. He returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in July, 682, with the official documents of the synod. He obtained such favour in the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> Pogonatus that the latter lessened the taxes which had been imposed on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> patrimonies in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and Calabria, and generally reduced the fiscal burdens from which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> suffered. John's energy, learning, and moderation are highly praised by his biographer. It was no doubt the possession of these virtues which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the basilica of St. John Lateran. The necessity of waiting for the imperial confirmation of papal elections having been abolished by Constantine Pognatus, John was straightway conducted to the Lateran palace as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> about 23 July, 685, and reigned for a little more than a year. From the days of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03139c.htm">Cagliari</a> in <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> enjoyed certain <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> powers. Although the right of consecrating the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the island was not one of his privileges, Citonatus of <a href="../cathen/03139c.htm">Cagliari</a> proceeded to lay hands on the bishop-elect of Turris Libisonis. John, however, definitively declared the See of Turris directly subject to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. John's generosity showed itself in his liberal donations. In his short pontificate he distributed 1900 <em>solidi</em> to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and to the deaconries for the poor. After a long illness, he died on 2 August, 686, and was buried in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>.
