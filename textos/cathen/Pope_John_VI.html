<h1>Pope John VI</h1>  

<p>(701-705).

<p>A Greek, the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of whose birth is unknown; d. 11 January, 705. He ascended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne 30 October, 701. Some time during his reign there came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> from <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> Theophylactus, "chamberlain, <em>patricius</em>, and <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>". After the treatment which some of his predecessors in the exarchate had meted out to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, the Italian people suspected that his visit boded no good to John VI. Accordingly, from all parts the local militias hurriedly marched to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and, encamping without the walls, made manifest their dislike of the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a>. To avoid bloodshed, John sent a number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to them, and succeeded in pacifying them; as far at least as the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> himself was concerned. Before the militias would disband, however, they insisted that certain informers, whose denunciations had put the wealth of some of the citizens into the hands of the grasping officials, should be handed over to them for punishment. Taking advantage of this want of harmony between the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> and the native <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> attached to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the Lombards renewed their attacks on such parts of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> as had hitherto resisted them. Several towns belonging to the Duchy of Rome were seized, Gisulf advanced as far as "Horrea" Puteoli &mdash; or perhaps the <em>"fundus Horrea"</em> at the fifth milestone on the Via Latina. As "there was no one who had power to resist him by force of arms", the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, distressed at the sufferings of the people, sent a number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> furnished with money into the camp of the Lombard duke. Not only did they ransom all the captives whom Gisulf had taken, but they persuaded him to retire to his own territories. John VI was one of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> before whom <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a> of York carried his appeals. Pointing out that the action of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> was wont to be consistent, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> adjured him to confirm in his behalf the decisions of his predecessors (704). This John did, and sent him back to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> with letters for King Ethelred and others. It was not, however, till the following year that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> mandates were obeyed. John sent the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> to Brithwald, whom "he confirmed as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>". He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>.
