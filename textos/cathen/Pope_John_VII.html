<h1>Pope John VII</h1>  

<p>(705-707).

<p>The year of his birth is unknown; d. 18 October, 707. Few particulars of his life remain. Like many other <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> during the period of Byzantine influence in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, John was a Greek. Sprung from a distinguished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, he was the son of Blatta and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. The latter carried out various restorations in the imperial palace on the Palatine hill in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and, for the sake, perhaps, of living where once his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> had lived, John after he had become <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (March 1, 705) constructed a palace (<em>episcopium</em>) near the church of Sancta Maria Antiqua. Before his elevation, John was the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> patrimony on the Appian way. It was in that capacity that he erected a memorial "with a broken heart to a most loving and incomparable mother, and to the kindest of fathers" (687). One of the churches which John beautified or restored during his pontificate was the afore-mentioned church of Sancta Maria Antiqua. "He adorned with frescoes the basilica of the Holy Mother of God which is known as <em>the Old</em>", and gave it a new <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambo</a>. When the remains of this church were brought to light in 1900, among the many figures found upon its walls, one with a square nimbus is supposed to represent John himself. There was also then discovered the base of his <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambo</a>. It bore upon it inscriptions which proclaimed him to be "the servant of Mary". John also erected a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> to <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. When this oratory was destroyed, some of his <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> were preserved, and may be seen in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> of Sancta Maria in Cosmedin and in other places. Though John was a man of learning and eloquence, and though he was remarkable for his filial affection and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, he was of a timorous disposition. Hence, when the fierce Emperor Justinian II sent him the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Quinisext Council</a>, "in which were many articles against the See of Rome", with a request that he would set forth what he approved in them, John simply returned them, as though there were nothing to condemn in them. He received back from the Lombard King Aripert II the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> patrimonies in the Cottian Alps, which the Lombards had confiscated. John is credited with having prevailed upon the Anglo-Saxon <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> resident in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to renounce their secular style of dress, and with having written to those in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> bidding them follow this example. John died in the palace he had built near the Palatine, and was buried in the oratory he had erected in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>.
