<h1>Pope John X</h1>  

<p>Born at Tossignano, Romagna; <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a>, 914; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 928. First a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, he became <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> about 905, as successor of Kailo. In a document <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 5 February, 914, he still appears as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Shortly afterwards, owing to the influence of the nobles dominant in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he was made <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in succession to <a href="../cathen/08784a.htm">Lando</a>. The real head of this aristocratical faction was the elder Theodora, wife of the Senator Theophylactus. <a href="../cathen/09313a.htm">Liutprand of Cremona</a> ("Antapodosis," II, ed. in "Mon. Germ. Hist.: Script., " II, 297) affirms that Theodora supported John's election in order to cover more easily her illicit relations with him. This statement is, however, generally and rightly rejected as a <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>. <a href="../cathen/09313a.htm">Liutprand</a> wrote his history some fifty years later, and constantly <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a> the Romans, whom he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>. At the time of John's election Theodora was advanced in years, and is lauded by other writers (e.g. Vulgarius). John was a relative of Theodora's <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and this explains sufficiently why she secured his election. The new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was an active and energetic ruler, and exerted himself especially to put an end to the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> invasions. He brought about an alliance between Prince Landulph of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Beneventum</a>, <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> of Friuli, King of the Lombards, and other Italian rulers, and, when <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 915, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> him emperor. John himself led against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> a large army gathered by the allied Italian princes. The <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> had built fortresses on the river Garigliano, but in August, 916, John completely routed them near the mouth of that river.

<p>Concerning the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> we possess many particulars. He sent to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> his trusted friend Petrus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Orte, who held in 916 a synod at Hohenaltheim (near Noerdlingen), and entered into friendly relations with King Conrad. John also concerned himself with affairs in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where Count Heribert of Aquitaine held King Charles a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, and demanded the election of his five-year-old son, Hugh of Vermandois, as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>. John unhappily confirmed this choice after Heribert had promised the king's release. He further sought to bring the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a> of <a href="../cathen/04606b.htm">Dalmatia</a> into closer relations with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and strove to induce the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14207a.htm">Spalato</a> to adopt Latin as the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> language. His efforts to promote a more intimate union between the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were frustrated by the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. Another opportunity offered, when later the Byzantine patriarch, Nicolaus Mysticus, sought the aid of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The patriarch had been deposed by a synod, because he would not recognize the fourth marriage of Emperor Leo VI. Before his death, however, Leo restored Nicolaus to his office, and the new emperor (Alexander) was also on his side. But many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were yet opposed to the patriarch on account of his deposition by the earlier synod. Under these circumstances Nicolaus wished to have the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of deposition declared invalid by another council, and towards this end desired the assistance of John. But John remained true to the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>, which permitted as valid even a fourth marriage. Meanwhile, he was active in the political life of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. After the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of King <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> in 924 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> supported Hugh of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a>, and, when the latter landed in <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, John sent his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to meet him and form an alliance. The dominant Roman faction disliked these measures. Foremost among them was the elder Marozia, daughter of Theophylactus and Theodora. After the death of her first husband Alberic, Marozia had married (926) Guido, the powerful Margrave of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>. The alliance of John and Hugh of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> seemed to endanger her power in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and so with her husband's aid she decided to remove John. Petrus, Prefect of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and brother of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> in June, 928. The pontiff himself was seized and cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, where he died shortly after. According to a rumour recorded by <a href="../cathen/09313a.htm">Liutprand</a>, and thus little to be relied on, he was smothered in his bed. <a href="../cathen/06105a.htm">Flodoard of Reims</a> asserts that he died of anxiety. He was probably buried in the Lateran, for the restoration of which he had been particularly <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a>.
