<h1>Pope John XII</h1>  

<p>Date of birth unknown; reigned 955-64.

<p>The younger Alberic, after the downfall of his mother, Marozia (932), was absolute ruler at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Before his death he administered an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> (954) to the Roman nobles in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>, that on the next vacancy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chair his only son, Octavius, should be elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. After the death of the reigning pontiff, <a href="../cathen/01203a.htm">Agapetus II</a>, Octavius, then eighteen years of age, was actually chosen his successor on 16 December, 955, and took the name of John. The temporal and spiritual authority in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were thus again united in one <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> &#151; a coarse, immoral man, whose life was such that the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran</a> was spoken of as a brothel, and the moral corruption in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> became the subject of general odium. War and the chase were more congenial to this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> than church government. He was defeated in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Duke Pandulf of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, and at the same time the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Ecclesiastical States</a> were occupied by <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a>, King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and his son Adalbert. In this dilemma the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had recourse to the German king, <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a>, who then appeared in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> at the head of a powerful army. <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a>, however, did not risk an encounter, but retired to the fortified castles. On 31 January, 962, Otto reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He took an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to recognize John as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and ruler of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; to issue no decrees without the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> consent; and, in case of his delivering the command in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to any one else, to exact from such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to defend to the utmost of his ability the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">patrimony of St. Peter</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on his part <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to keep <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with Otto and to conclude no alliance with <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> and Adalbert. On 2 February, 962, Otto was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. On the twelfth a Roman synod took place, at which John, at Otto's desire, founded the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> and the Bishopric of Morseburg, bestowed the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> on the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> and <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and confirmed the appointment of Rother as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>. The next day, the emperor issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, the famous <em>Diploma Ottonianum</em>, in which he confirmed the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> in its possessions, particularly those granted by Pepin and <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, and provided at the same time that in future the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> should be elected in canonical form, though their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> was to take place only after the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> pledges had been given to the emperor or his ambassadors. The authenticity of the contents of this much-discussed document is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, even should the extant document be only a duplicate of the original (Sickel, "Das Privilegium Ottos I, f&uuml;r die r&ouml;mische Kirche", Innsbruck, 1883). On 14 February the emperor marched out of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with his army to resume the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> and Adalbert. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> now quickly changed his mind, while Otto on his part urged the imperial authority to excessive limits. John began secret negotiations with Adalbert, son of <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a>, and sent envoys with letters to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and to Constantinople for the purpose of inciting a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Otto. They were, however, seized by the imperial soldiers, and the emperor thus learned of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> treachery. John now sent an embassy to Otto to propitiate the latter, and at the same time to explain the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> grievance, which was that the emperor had received for himself the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance from those cities of the Ecclesiastical States, which he had reconquered from <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a>. Otto sent an embassy to refute this accusation. At the same time Adalbert came in person to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was ceremoniously received by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The faction of the Roman nobles which sympathized with the emperor now broke into revolt against John. Otto appeared for the second time in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (2 November, 963), while John and Adalbert fled to <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a>. In the emperor's entourage was <a href="../cathen/09313a.htm">Liutprand</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, who thus describes the occurrences as an eyewitness. Otto now probably renewed and extended the settlement formerly effected, by obtaining from the nobles a promise on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> not to elect or <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> without the consent of the emperor.

<p>On 6 November a synod composed of fifty Italian and German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was convened in St. Peter's; John was accused of sacrilege, <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a>, <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and incest, and was summoned in writing to defend himself. Refusing to recognize the synod, John pronounced sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> (<em>ferend&aelig; sententia</em>) against all participators in the assembly, should they elect in his stead another <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The emperor now came forward to accuse John of having broken the agreement ratified by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, betrayed him, and called in Adalbert. With the imperial consent the synod deposed John on 4 December, and elected to replace him the <em>protoscriniarius</em> Leo, yet a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. The latter received all the orders uncanonically without the proper intervals (<em>interstitia</em>), and was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as <a href="../cathen/09160b.htm">Leo VIII</a>. This proceeding was aginst the canons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroning</a> of Leo was almost universally regarded as invalid. Most of the imperial troops now departing from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, John's adherents rose against the emperor, but were suppressed on 3 January, 964, with bloodshed. Nevertheless, at Leo's request, Otto released the hundred hostages whom he had called for, and marched from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to meet Adalbert in the field. A new insurrection broke out in the city against the imperial party; <a href="../cathen/09160b.htm">Leo VIII</a> fled, while John XII re-entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and took bloody vengeance on the leaders of the opposite party. Cardinal-Deacon John had his right hand struck off, Bishop Otgar of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a> was scourged, a high palatine official lost nose and ears. On 26 February, 964, John held a synod in St. Peter's in which the decrees of the synod of 6 November were repealed; <a href="../cathen/09160b.htm">Leo VIII</a> and all who had elected him were <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>; his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> was pronounced invalid; and Bishop Sico of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, who had <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him, was deprived forever of his dignities. The emperor, left free to act after his defeat of <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a>, was preparing to re-enter <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> death changed the situation. John died on 14 May, 964, eight days after he had been, according to rumour, stricken by paralysis in the act of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Luitprand relates that on that occasion the devil dealt him a blow on the temple in consequence of which he died.
