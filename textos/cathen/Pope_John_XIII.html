<h1>Pope John XIII</h1>  

<p>Date of birth unknown; <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> on 1 Oct., 965; d. 6 Sept., 972. After the death of <a href="../cathen/08426b.htm">John XII</a> in 964 Benedictus Grammaticus was elected his successor as <a href="../cathen/02428b.htm">Benedict V</a>. But <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a> brought back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/09160b.htm">Leo VIII</a>, whom he had set up in 963, and banished Benedict to Hamburg. <a href="../cathen/09160b.htm">Leo VIII</a> died in March, 965, whereupon the Romans requested the emperor to send Benedict back to them as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. But Otto refused, and Benedict died shortly after in July, 965. In presence of the imperial envoys, <a href="../cathen/09313a.htm">Liutprand</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04483a.htm">Cremona</a>, and Otgar, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, the emperor's candidate, John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10704a.htm">Narni</a>, was elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> on 1 October, 965, as John XIII. He belonged to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the elder Theodora, who by her marriage with the senator Theophylactus had, besides Marozia, another daughter, the younger Theodora, who married the consul John. This John later entered the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a> and became a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. From his union with Theodora sprang two daughters and three sons, among the latter one called John, who, while still in his youth, entered the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and later became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10704a.htm">Narni</a>. It was on this scion of the Roman nobility that the choice of the electors fell. Some of the nobles were hostile to the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, because he was the imperial candidate, and, when he endeavoured to repress their encroachments, they plotted against him, and in December, 965, succeeded in getting possession of his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. They shut him up in the Castle of Sant' Angelo, and subsequently removed him to a fortified place in Campagna. John succeeded, however, in escaping from his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and found welcome and protection with Prince Pandulf of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a reaction set in towards the exiled <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and, when in 966 Emperor Otto undertook another expedition to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the Romans were terrified and permitted John to return to the city on 14 November. In December the emperor arrived and dispensed stern <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to the conspirators, some of whom were hanged and others banished.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> now allied himself closely with the emperor. On 11 January, 967, a synod was held in St. Peter's, concerning the results of which nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. John travelled with Otto to <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, where in April, 967, he held another synod in which the elevation of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> to <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> dignity was confirmed, disputes were decided, privileges conferred upon churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> with its territory restored to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as part of the Ecclesiastical States. Relations between John and the emperor continued cordial. On <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, 967, the latter's thirteen-year-old son, <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>, came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> joint emperor with his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. Shortly after, at one of the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> held in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which the emperor had founded at <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a> in Saxony was made a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. John also favoured the negotiations held with the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> for a matrimonial alliance between <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> and the Princess Theophano. The marriage took place at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was blessed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself on 14 April, 972. After the death of Archbishop William of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and Bishop Bernard of Halberstadt in 968, the new <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> at <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> in <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavic</a> territory, for which the emperor had worked <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> and which had been confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, was finally realized. On <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, 968, Abbot Adalbert was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> first <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, and in turn <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the first Bishops of Merseburg, <a href="../cathen/10148b.htm">Meissen</a>, and Zeitz. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was also active in extending the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in other countries. Early in his pontificate he had raised <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a> to <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank in gratitude for the shelter which Prince Pandulf had afforded him. At a Roman synod in 969 <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> received the same dignity. He confirmed the decrees of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> held in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Privileges were granted to churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, especially to Cluny, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> decided numerous questions of ecclesiastical law, referred to him from various countries. The plan of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> Duke Boleslaus II for the foundation of a see at <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, though approved by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, had to be deferred to a later date. John XIII was succeeded by <a href="../cathen/02428c.htm">Benedict VI</a>.
