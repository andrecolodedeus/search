<h1>Pope John XIX (XX)</h1>  

<p>Enthroned in 1024; d. 1032. After the death of the last <em>patricius</em> of the House of Crescentius, the counts of Tusculum seized the authority in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, a scion of this <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was raised to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne as <a href="../cathen/02428e.htm">Benedict VIII</a>, while his brother, Romanus, exercised the temporal power in the city as consul and senator. After Benedict's death Romanus, though a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, was elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> between 12 April and 10 May, 1024, immediately after which he received all the orders in succession, took the name of John, and sought by lavish expenditure to win the Romans to his cause. Soon after his elevation the Byzantine Emperor, Basil II, sent ambassadors to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to request in his name that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> would recognize the title of oecumenical patriarch, which the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of Byzantium had assumed, thus sanctioning the latter's headship of all the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a>. Rich presents brought by the envoys were intended to win over the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and indeed he seemed not disinclined to accede to the Byzantine wishes. Though the negotiations were kept secret the affair became public, and roused to action the religiously minded circles, especially the promoters of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reform in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Public opinion compelled the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to refuse the Byzantine requests and gifts, whereupon Patriarch Eustachius of Constantinople caused the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> name to be erased from the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> of his churches. John invited the celebrated musician, <a href="../cathen/07065a.htm">Guido of Arezzo</a>, to visit <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and explain the musical notation invented by him. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, after the death of Henry II (1 July, 1024), Conrad the Salian was elected king, and was invited by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and also by Archbishop Heribert of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, to come to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In 1026 he crossed the Alps, received the iron crown of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, and proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where on 26 March, 1027, he was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor. Two kings, Rudolph of <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundy</a> and Canute of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, took part in this journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>On 6 April a great synod was held in the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran basilica</a>, where the dispute between the Patriarchs of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> and Grado was decided, through the emperor's influence, in favour of the former. Poppo of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> was to be sole patriarch, with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Grado under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> was to take precedence over all the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Two years later (1029) John XIX revoked this decision, and at a new synod restored to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Grado all his former privileges. King Canute of <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> obtained from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a promise that his English and <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Danish</a> subjects should not be annoyed by customs <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> on their way to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of his kingdom should not be so heavily taxed for the bestowal of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>. John granted the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Silva Candida, near <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, a special privilege to say <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in St. Peter's on certain days. A dispute regarding precedence between the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> was settled by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in favour of the former. He took the Abbey of Cluny under his protection, and renewed its privileges in spite of the protests of Goslin, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a>; at the same time he rebuked Abbot Odilo of Cluny for not accepting the See of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. The feast of <a href="../cathen/09721c.htm">St. Martial</a>, reputed disciple of the Apostles and founder of the church of <a href="../cathen/09263a.htm">Limoges</a>, was raised by John to the rank of the feast of an Apostle. In the case of certain <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> maintained the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. He seems to have been the first <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to grant an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> in return for <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> bestowed. He died towards the end of 1032, probably on 6 November.
