<h1>Pope John XV (XVI)</h1>  

<p>Enthroned 985; d. April, 996. After <a href="../cathen/08427b.htm">John XIV</a> had been removed by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">force</a>, the usurper, <a href="../cathen/02661c.htm">Boniface VII</a>, reigned eleven months, dying in July, 985. A Roman named John, the son of a Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Leo, was then elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> between 6 August and 5 September, 985. A few later chroniclers (<a href="../cathen/09662b.htm">Marianus Scotus</a>, <a href="../cathen/06626b.htm">Godfrey of Viterbo</a>) and some <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> catalogues give as the immediate successor of <a href="../cathen/02661c.htm">Boniface</a> another John, son of Robert, who is supposed to have reigned four months, and is placed by a few historians in the list of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> as John XV. Although this alleged Pope John never existed, still the fact that he has been catalogued by these historians has thrown into disorder the numeration of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> named John, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> John XV being often called John XVI. At this time the patrician <a href="../cathen/04484c.htm">John Crescentius</a>, son of Duke Crescentius, with the help of his adherents, had obtained entire control of the temporal power in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. According to some chroniclers the ascendancy of Crescentius became so irksome to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, to whom he even forbade access except in return for bribes, that John fled to <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> and sought aid from the Empress Theophano, but allowed himself to be induced by the promises of Crescentius to return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. As a matter of fact, John remained throughout his pontificate under the influence of the powerful <em>patricius,</em> though he maintained friendly relations with the German court and with both empresses&mdash;Adelaide, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Otto I</a>, and Theophano, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> mediation was sought by <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in the quarrel between King &#198;thelred and Richard of Normandy. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, Leo of Trevi, brought about between the parties the Peace of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> (1 March, 991), which was ratified by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a>.

<p>A serious dispute occurred during this pontificate over the archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> interference leading at first to no definite result. <a href="../cathen/07515c.htm">Hugh Capet</a>, who had been raised to the throne of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, made Arnulf, a nephew of Duke Charles of Lorraine, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a> in 998. Charles was an adversary of <a href="../cathen/07515c.htm">Hugh Capet</a>, and succeeded in taking <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> and making the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. Hugh, however, considered Arnulf a traitor, and demanded his deposition by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Before the latter's answer was received, <a href="../cathen/07515c.htm">Hugh Capet</a> captured both Duke Charles and Archbishop Arnulf, and called a synod at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> in June, 991, which deposed Arnulf and chose as his successor Abbot Gerbert (afterwards Pope Sylvester II). These proceedings were repudiated by <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, although a synod at Chela had sanctioned the decrees of that of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> summoned the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to hold an independent synod at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> to reconsider the case. When they refused, he called them to a synod at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but they urged the unsettled conditions in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> as a reason for not obeying this summons. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> then sent Abbot Leo of St. Boniface to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, with instructions to call a council of French and German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at Mousson. At this council only the German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> appeared, the French being stopped on the way by Kings Hugh and Robert. Gerbert tried to exculpate himself at the synod convened on 2 June, 995, but was condemned and suspended until 1 July, when a new synod was held at <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. Through the exertions of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, the deposition of Arnulf was pronounced illegal. After <a href="../cathen/07515c.htm">Hugh Capet's</a> death (23 October, 996), Arnulf was released from his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, and in 997 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> secured his restoration to all his dignities. Gerbert set out for the imperial court at <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, and became the preceptor of <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a>. At a Roman <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in the Lateran on 31 January, 993, Bishop Ulrich of <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>, an event which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> announced to the French and German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 3 February. This was the first time that a solemn <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> had been made by a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. John conferred many privileges on churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, and was a patron and protector of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Cluny. In 996 Emperor Otto undertook a journey to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to obtain imperial <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but John died early in April, while Otto lingered until 12 April in <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, where he celebrated <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>.
