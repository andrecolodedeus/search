<h1>Pope John XXII</h1>  

<p>(JACQUES D'EUSE)

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/03141a.htm">Cahors</a> in 1249; <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a>, 5 September, 1316; died at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, 4 December, 1334. He received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> from the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> in his native town, and later studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and law at <a href="../cathen/10545a.htm">Montpellier</a> and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He then taught both canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> at <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and Cahors, came into close relations with Charles II of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and on his recommendation was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06269a.htm">Fr&eacute;jus</a> in 1300. In 1309 he was appointed chancellor of Charles II, and in 1310 was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">See of Avignon</a>. He delivered legal opinions favourable to the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a>, but he also defended <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15126a.htm">"Unam Sanctam"</a>. On 23 December, 1312, <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> made him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of Porto. After the death of <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> (20 April, 1314) the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was vacant for two years and three and a half months. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> assembled in Carpentras for the election of a pope were divided into two violent factions, and could come to no agreement. The electoral college was composed of eight <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, ten from Gascony, three from Provence, and three from other parts of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. After many weeks of unprofitable discussion as to where the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> should be held, the electoral assembly was entirely dissolved. Ineffectual were the efforts of several princes to induce the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to undertake an election: neither party would yield. After his <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> Philip V of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was finally able to assemble a <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of twenty-three <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> on 26 June, 1316, and on 7 August, Jacques, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of Porto, was chosen <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. After his <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> on 5 September as John XXII, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> set out for <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, where he fixed his residence.

<p>His vast correspondence shows that John XXII followed closely the political and religious movements in all countries, and sought on every possible occasion the advancement of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> interests. Nor was he less insistent than his predecessors on the supreme influence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> in political matters. For this reason he found himself involved in grievous disputes which lasted throughout the greater portion of his pontificate. Great difficulties were also raised for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by the controversies among the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, which <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> had tried in vain to settle. A number of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, the so-called "Spirituals," or "Fraticelli," adherents of the most rigorous views, refused to submit to that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> decision, and after the deaths of <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> and Gonzalvez, General of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a>, they rebelled, especially in the South of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, declaring that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had no power to dispense them from their rule, since this was nothing other than the Gospel. They then proceeded to drive the <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a> from their houses, and take possession of the same, thereby causing <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> and much disorder. The new general, <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a>, appealed to John, who in 1317 ordered the refractory <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> to submit to their superiors, and caused the doctrines and opinions of the Spirituals to be investigated. On 23 January, 1318, many of their doctrines were declared <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>. Those who refused to yield were treated as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>: many were burned at the stake, and some escaped to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>.

<p>These troubles among the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> were increased by the quarrel about evangelical poverty which broke out among the <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a> themselves. The general chapter of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, through their general, <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a>, and other learned men of the order (including William Occam), defended the opinion of B&eacute;renger Talon, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> had no possessions either individually or in common. In 1322 Pope John declared this statement null and void, and in 1323 denounced as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> the assertion that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the Apostles had no possessions either individually or in common, and could not even legitimately dispose of what they had for personal use. Not only the Spirituals, but also the adherents of <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a> and William Occam, protested against this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, whereupon in 1324 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> issued a new <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, confirming his former decision, setting aside all objections to it, and declaring those who opposed this decision <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Summoned to appear at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a> obeyed the summons, but refused to yield and, when threatened with <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, sought safety in flight. Leaving <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> on 25 May, 1328, and accompanied by William Occam and Bonagratia di Bergamo, he betook himself to Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> for protection.

<p>Political conditions in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> moved the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to assert over the latter far-reaching political claims, and similarly with regard to the German Crown, because of the latter's union with the imperial office. On this score a violent quarrel broke out between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and King Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. During the vacancy that followed the death of <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, there had arisen a disputed election for the throne of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> having been <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, and Frederick of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> at <a href="../cathen/02673b.htm">Bonn</a> (25 Nov., 1314). The electors of both candidates wrote to the future <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to obtain recognition of their choice, and also to seek for him imperial <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>. On the day of his <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> (5 Sept., 1315) John wrote to both Louis and Frederick and also to the other German princes, admonishing them to settle their disputes amicably. As there was no universally acknowledged German king, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had not given preference to either candidate, neither could hope to exercise imperial authority. Nevertheless, in 1315 Louis appointed Jean de Belmont imperial vicar for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and at the same time supported Galeazzo Visconti of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, then in open opposition to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The latter maintained (13 March, 1317) that, by reason of the vacancy of the Roman Empire, all imperial <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> resided with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and, following the example of his predecessor <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a>, he appointed King Robert of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> imperial vicar for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (July, 1317). On 28 September, 1322, Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> informed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> that he had overcome his opponent, Frederick of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, upon which John wrote him a friendly letter.



<p>Louis, however, took no further steps to effect a reconciliation with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. On the contrary, he supported in their opposition to the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Visconti of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibellines</a>, acted as legitimate emperor, and proclaimed, on 2 March, 1323, Berthold von Neiffen imperial vicar for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Thereupon John, following the precedent of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> and <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, warned Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> that the examination and approval of the chosen German king with a view to the consequent bestowal of the imperial dignity belonged to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; that he must refrain from exercising royal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> until the legitimacy of his election had been settled; that he must recall all commands already issued, give no further aid to the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> &mdash; especially the Visconti of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, condemned as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> &mdash; and within three months present himself before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Should Louis not submit to this admonition, he was threatened with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. The subsequent behaviour of Louis was very equivocal. He sent an embassy to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, asking for and obtaining a delay of two months before appearing in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> presence. At the same time he declared at <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> on 16 November, 1323, that he did not recognize the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> action or his claim to examine into the election of a German king; he also accused John of countenancing <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and proposed the calling of a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> to sit in judgment on him. During this respite, lengthened at his own request, Louis took no steps towards a reconciliation, and on 23 March, 1324, John pronounced on the king the sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. On the other hand the latter published at Sachsenhausen on 22 May, 1324, an appeal in which he accused the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of enmity to the empire, of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and protection of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and appealed from John's decision to a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. An open breach henceforth existed, followed by disastrous results. Louis <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the few German <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, who recognized the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a>, whereupon John on 11 July, 1324, declared all his <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to imperial recognition forfeited. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> further ratified the treaty between Duke Leopold of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> and Charles I of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in which the former promised to help the latter to the title of German King, and then of Roman Emperor. However, as Leopold died on 28 Feb., 1326, and Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and Frederick of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> became reconciled, the king's power in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> became firmly established.

<p>The quarrel between John XXII and Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> stirred up a vigorous literary feud concerning the relations of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. Louis was supported by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Spirituals, e.g. Ubertino da Casale, <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a>, William Occam, Bonagratia di Bergamo, and many others whose extreme <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> on the question of religious poverty had been condemned by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; also by two <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, Marsilius of Papua and John of Gentian (de Gentian), joint authors of the famous "Defensor Paces," which was intended to prove that the only way to maintain peace is by the complete subordination of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> power to that of the State. Denying the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the authors asserted that the emperor alone could authorize <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> to exercise criminal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, that all temporal goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> belonged to the emperor, etc. Other <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> &mdash; e.g. Henry von Kelheim, <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a>, Ulrich Hanganoer, the king's private secretary, Abbot Engelbert of Admont, Lupold of Bebenburg, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02242c.htm">Bamberg</a>, and William Occam, though not so extreme in their views as the authors of the "Defensor Paces," willingly exalted the imperial above the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power. It was unfortunate for the fickle and, in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> matters, inexperienced king that he fell into the hands of such advisers. The "Defensor Paces" was <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a> of 23 October, 1327, and some of its theses were condemned as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> in their writings defended the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a> and the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, among them the Augustinian Alexander a Sancto Elpidio, later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorite</a>, Alvarius Pelagius, the Augustinian Augustinus Triumphus of <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, and Conrad of Megenberg. On their side, however, the defence was carried too far, some of them even extolling the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as absolute ruler of the world.

<p>When Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> saw his power firmly established in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, he set out early in 1327 for <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where in February, with the chiefs of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibellines</a>, he held a congress at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>. In March he passed through Bergamo on his way to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. On 3 April John XXII declared forfeited all <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of Louis to the German Crown, also to all fiefs held from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and from former sovereigns, and finally to the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. Moreover, he summoned Louis to appear before the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> within six months, and accused him of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> for defending a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had repudiated, and for taking under his protection the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, Marsilius and John of Gentian. Louis paid no attention to this notice, which indeed only aggravated his opposition to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> he received (30 May) the crown of <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> from the hands of two deposed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and arbitrarily appointed several new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on his side appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to sees falling vacant within the empire, and continued to fill the various reserved prelacies, so that an open <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> henceforth existed. In 1328 Louis set out for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a> had been overthrown with their senator, King Robert of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. On 17 January, 1328, the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> German king received in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the imperial crown from Sciarra Colonna, who on 18 April, after a farcical proceeding, and in the name of Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, proclaimed John XXII a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, usurper, and oppressor of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and deprived him of all his <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> dignities. A straw image of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was publicly burned in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and on 12 May the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Spiritual, Pietro Rainalducci of Corbario, was proclaimed <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> by Louis, taking at his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> (22 May) the name of <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>.

<p>But Louis had made himself so universally obnoxious in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, on account of his tax levies, that the position of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> was untenable. Many <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> cities and rulers became reconciled with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and finally Pietro of Corbario himself wrote to John, asking for pardon and <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>. At <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> on 25 August, 1330, he publicly acknowledged his guilt in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, whereupon the former gave him <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11595a.htm">kiss of peace</a>. Nevertheless, Pietro was not allowed to leave the city, where he spent the three remaining years of his life in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> penance and study. By degrees the whole of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> returned to the obedience of the legitimate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The latter meanwhile had renewed his sentence against Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and proclaimed in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against him (1328). At the same time he summoned the German princes to hold another election, and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/10274b.htm">Michael of Cesena</a>, William Occam, and Bonagratia. The adherents of Louis in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> soon dwindled away, and he returned to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in the beginning of 1330. Here too, the people were weary of the long conflict, and wished for peace, so that Louis was compelled to take steps towards a reconciliation with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In May, 1330, he entered into negotiations with <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> through the mediation of Archbishop Baldwin of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, King John of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, and Duke Otto of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> demanded from Louis renunciation of all claims on the imperial title. Louis on that occasion refused to entertain the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>, but was later (1333) willing to discuss the project of his abdication. The matter, however, was then postponed. Whether John XXII arbitrarily severed <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> from the empire has never been definitely settled, for the authenticity of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Ne praetereat" is not certain.

<p>In the last years of John's pontificate there arose a dogmatic conflict about the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">Beatific Vision</a>, which was brought on by himself, and which his enemies made use of to discredit him. Before his elevation to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, he had written a work on this question, in which he stated that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the blessed departed do not see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> until after the Last Judgment. After becoming <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he advanced the same teaching in his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>. In this he met with strong opposition, many <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, who adhered to the usual opinion that the blessed departed did see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> before the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">Resurrection of the Body</a> and the Last Judgment, even calling his view <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. A great commotion was aroused in the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> when the General of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a> and a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> tried to disseminate there the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> view. Pope John wrote to <a href="../cathen/12004a.htm">King Philip IV</a> on the matter (November, 1333), and emphasized the fact that, as long as the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> had not given a decision, the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> enjoyed perfect freedom in this matter. In December, 1333, the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, after a consultation on the question, decided in favour of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the blessed departed saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> immediately after death or after their complete purification; at the same time they pointed out that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had given no decision on this question but only advanced his personal opinion, and now petitioned the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to confirm their decision. John appointed a commission at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> to study the writings of the Fathers, and to discuss further the disputed question. In a consistory held on 3 January, 1334, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> explicitly declared that he had never meant to teach aught contrary to <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> or the <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a> and in fact had not intended to give any decision whatever. Before his death he withdrew his former opinion, and declared his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> separated from their bodies enjoyed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">Beatific Vision</a>.

<p>The Spirituals, always in close alliance with Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, profited by these events to accuse the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, being supported by Cardinal Napoleon Orsini. In union with the latter, King Louis wrote to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, urging them to call a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> and condemn the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The incident, however, had no further consequences. With untiring energy, and in countless documents, John followed up all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or politico-ecclesiastical questions of his day, though no particular grandeur is remarkable in his dealings. He gave salutary advice to ruling sovereigns, especially to the Kings of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, settled the disputes of rulers, and tried to restore peace in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. He increased the number of sees in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, was generous to many scholars and colleges, founded a law <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> at <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, furthered the <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a>, and dispatched and generously maintained missionaries in the Far East. He caused the works of Petrus Olivi and <a href="../cathen/05274a.htm">Meister Eckhardt</a> to be examined, and condemned the former, while he censured many passages in the latter's works. He published the "Clementines" as the official collection of the "Corpus Juris Canonici," and was the author of numerous <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a> ("Extravagantes Johannis XXII" in "Corp. Jur. Can."). He enlarged and partly reorganized the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>, and was particularly active in the administration of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> finances.

<p>The usual revenues of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> grew very meagre, owing to the disturbed condition of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, especially of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, consequent on the removal of the Papacy from its historic seat at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Moreover, since the end of the thirteenth century the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a> had enjoyed one half of the large income from tributary kingdoms, the <em>servitia communia</em> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and some less important sources. Pope John, on the other hand, had need of large revenues, not only for the maintenance of his Court, but particularly for the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Since the thirteenth century the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> treasury had exacted from the minor <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, when conferred directly by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, a small tax (annata. &mdash; See <a href="../cathen/01537b.htm">ANNATES</a>; <a href="../cathen/01633b.htm">APOSTOLIC CAMERA</a>). In 1319 John XXII reserved to himself all minor <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> falling vacant in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> during the succeeding three years, and in this way collected from each of them the aforesaid annates, as often as they were conferred by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Moreover, many foreign <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> were already canonically in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> gift, and the annates from them were paid regularly into the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> treasury. John also made frequent use of the right known as <em>jus spolii</em>, or right of spoils, which permitted him under certain circumstances to divert the estate of a deceased <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> into the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> treasury. He procured further relief by demanding special subsidies from various <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and their suffragans. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in particular, furnished him the most financial aid. The extensive reservation of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a> was destined to exercise a prejudicial influence on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life. The centralized administration took on a highly bureaucratic character, and the purely legal standpoint was too constantly in evidence. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> financial measures, however, were highly successful at the time, though in the end they evoked no little resistance and dissatisfaction. In spite of the large expenditures of his pontificate, John left an estate of 800,000 gold florins &mdash; not five millions as stated by some chroniclers.

<p>John XXII died on 4 December, 1334, in the eighty-fifth year of his age. He was a man of serious character, of austere and simple habits, broadly cultivated, very energetic and tenacious. But he held too persistently to canonico-legal traditions, and centralized overmuch the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration. His financial measures, more rigorously applied by his successors, made the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> generally detested. The transfer of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> was esteemed to have taken place in the interests of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, which impression was strengthened by the preponderance of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and by the long-continued conflict with King Louis of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. In this way was aroused a widespread distrust of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, which could not fail to result in consequences detrimental to the interior life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
