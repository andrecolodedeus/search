<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope John XXI (XX)</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> between 1210 and 1220; <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a>, 1276; died at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, 20 May, 1277. The son of one Julianus, he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> Peter, and was known as Petrus Juliani or Petrus Hispanus. After his earlier studies in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, he entered the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a> and attended lectures on dialectics, <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, and, more particularly, those on <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotelean</a> physics and <a href="../cathen/10226a.htm">metaphysics</a> then being given by <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a>. The natural philosophy of <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle</a> had a special attraction for Peter. He <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> pursued the study of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a>, and also that of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, attaching himself especially to the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorite</a> <em>magister</em>, <a href="../cathen/08475c.htm">John of Parma</a>. On completing his studies, he was called in 1247 as professor of <a href="../cathen/10122a.htm">medicine</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13781a.htm">University of Siena</a>, which was at that time being greatly enlarged. Here he wrote his "Summul&aelig; logicales", for almost three hundred years the favourite textbook on <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>. Stapper's investigations (see below) have now established beyond question the authorship of this work. In the fifteenth century the "Summul&aelig;" was translated into Greek by George Scholarius, and was also translated into other languages. In content and form the book is based on the method current at the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, and on the compendium of William Shyreswood, Peter's professor there. While teaching at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, he also made a collection of medical prescriptions.

<p>About 1261 Peter appears in the retinue of Cardinal Ottoboni Fieschi; towards this time also he was made <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Church of Lisbon</a>, an office which he later exchanged for the archidiaconate of Vermuy in the <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Diocese of Braga</a>. From this period probably dates his acquaintance with Teobaldo Visconti. When, in 1272, Teobaldo came to <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> after his election to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> as <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a>, he appointed Petrus Hispanus his physician in ordinary. While occupying this position, the latter wrote his "Thesaurus pauperum", in which he gives a remedy for the diseases of every part of the body. This book was widely used, but was in time variously interpolated. Peter's wide reputation for learning led to his selection as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter in spring, 1273. Shortly afterwards <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of Tusculum, and as such he is referred to on 5 June, 1273. But he continued to govern temporarily the See of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> until 23 May, 1275, when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appointed another <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. In June, 1273, Peter accompanied <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> to the General Council of Lyons, where he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X's</a> two successors in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, <a href="../cathen/08018a.htm">Innocent V</a> and <a href="../cathen/01159a.htm">Adrian V</a>, ruled only a very short time. The latter died at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> on 18 August, 1276, having been elected on the preceding 11 July. In a consistory of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, he had spoken of an alteration in the decrees of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">papal conclave</a>, and had suspended them temporarily. After the death of <a href="../cathen/01159a.htm">Adrian V</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> in <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> was protracted, in consequence of which disturbances broke out in the town, thus hastening the election, so that in the week following 13 September Petrus Juliani, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of Tusculum, was chosen <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> as John XXI (really XX) the following Sunday (20 September). The new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> wished forthwith to arrange the rules for the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Licet felicis recordationis", ratifying his predecessor's decision, he also suspended with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> the decrees issued at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, and declared his intention of issuing in the near future the new regulations. On the same day (20 September, 1276) he issued another <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, directed against those who had taken part in the disturbances during the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">last council</a> (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">CONCLAVE</a>).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was now in a position to turn his attention to the political situation. Since 1263, when <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> had bestowed the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Kingdom of Sicily</a> upon Charles of Anjou, the latter had tried little by little to strengthen his political power in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>. Charles himself went to <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> to win over the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but the latter did not assent to his plans. On 7 October, the king took the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of fealty for <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, in which it was provided that <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> should never be united with <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> or <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, nor yet with the Roman Empire. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, however, did not reappoint him Roman senator, neither did he make him Vicar of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> or <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, honours which <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> had bestowed upon him. In November, John sent an ambassador with letters to Rudolf of Hapsburg, inviting him to send a plenipotentiary to the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> to negotiate with the plenipotentiary sent by Charles of Anjou concerning the conclusion of peace. As soon as this should be accomplished, Rudolf was to set out for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to receive the imperial crown. Soon after, John began negotiations with Rudolf relative to Romagna, the ancient Exarchate of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, which he wished definitely restored to the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08018a.htm">Innocent V</a> had already claimed. Concerning the collection and employment of the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> levied on all <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>, which the Council of Lyons had ordered in preparation for a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> issued various instructions for the different countries. The cross had been taken by Philip III of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and Alfonso of Castile and Leon, and in February, 1276, Philip solemnly declared that he would lead the army in person against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>. But the two kings found themselves involved in a quarrel over the Kingdom of Navarre. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> laboured to avert the outbreak of hostilities by sending, in November, 1276, <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to both kings, and by remonstrating with the parties in earnest and urgent letters. Soon after this Philip had to disband the large army he had assembled, and a treaty was arranged between the rulers. But in the spring of 1277 the two kings began again to make preparations for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and again the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to send his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to mediate, wherein they were again successful.

<p>John also endeavoured to secure from the King of <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> an amelioration of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> conditions in that country, but his pontificate was too short to witness the realization of his purpose. He demanded from Edward I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the arrears of tribute which that country had owed the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> since the reign of King John (1215). He also sought the release of Eleanor, Countess of Montfort, and her brother Amaury, whom King Edward held <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>. Many letters were sent by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to the king and the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> relative to this matter. The envoys sent out by the Byzantine emperor, Michael Pal&aelig;ologus, to the Council of Lyons <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> that the emperor had renounced the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and wished to return to the obedience of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In this way the emperor sought to obtain the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> protection against the Western princes, who threatened his domination. An embassy from Constantinople had already been sent to the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> in <a href="../cathen/08018a.htm">Innocent V's</a> reign, and that pontiff had appointed an envoy to the Byzantine Court, but died before the latter left <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Pope John appointed other envoys, two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and two <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, and furnished them with minute instructions, as well as with letters for the Emperor Michael, his son Andronicus, and the Greek <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In April, 1277, a synod was held at Constantinople under the presidency of the new patriarch, <a href="../cathen/02380b.htm">John Beccus</a>, who was an earnest supporter of the union of the Churches. At this synod the emperor and his son embraced the <a href="../cathen/13121a.htm">Roman Catholic Faith</a>, and ratified all the promises previously made in their name at the Council of Lyons. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> assembled at the synod acknowledged the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> primacy and the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, and the patriarch addressed a letter to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in which all minor discrepancy in teaching was satisfactorily explained. The messenger, who had charge of this epistle as well as of the documents drawn up by the emperor, did not arrive until after John's death. From the Far East, ambassadors came to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> from Abaga, Khan of Tatary, who had also sent an embassy to the Council of Lyons. The khan wished to enter into an alliance with the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusaders</a> and to give them his support; he also asked to have missionaries sent to him. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sent the ambassadors to Charles of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, Peter of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, Philip of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and Edward of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but none of these sovereigns had any serious intention of undertaking a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>. John himself appointed missionaries to go to Tatar, but died before they set out on their journey.

<p>Although John showed especial favour towards the <a href="../cathen/11495a.htm">University of Paris</a>, he took care to exclude all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> teaching from this famous seat of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> learning. Some chroniclers maintain that this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was an enemy of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>. However, among the documents sent from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancellery under John XXI, there are numerous letters in which he grants privileges and ratifies donations to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. On many occasions, also, he gave evidence of his great respect for the monastic orders. On what particular act of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> this adverse criticism is based, is unknown; however, in the most trustworthy accounts of his life, no foundation is found for this reproach. During this pontificate Cardinal Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, who later ascended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne as <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a>, exercised a great influence on the government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Amid the cares of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> John found time for his <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">scientific</a> studies, which were more congenial to him than the business of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>. To secure the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> quiet for these studies, he had an apartment added to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> palace at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, to which he could retire when he wished to work undisturbed. On 14 May, 1277, while the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was alone in this apartment, it collapsed; John was buried under the ruins, and died on 20 May in consequence of the serious injuries he had received. Soon after the death of this scholarly <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, various rumours were circulated, based upon his great medical learning; he was even accused of dealing in the magic arts. A few monastic chroniclers, seeing in him an enemy, contributed to these baseless tales, and thus an undeserved stigma was cast upon the memory of John XXI.
