<h1>Pope Julius II</h1>  

<p>(GIULIANO DELLA ROVERE).

<p>Born on 5 December, 1443, at Albissola near Savona; <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> on 28 November, 1503; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in the night of 20-21 February, 1513. He was born of a probably noble but impoverished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> being Raffaelo della Rovere and his mother Theodora Manerola, a lady of Greek extraction. He followed his uncle Francesco della Rovere into the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> under his tutelage at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>. With the elevation of his uncle to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> as <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> on 9 August, 1471, begins the public career of Giuliano. On 15 December, 1471, he was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal Priest</a> of San Pietro in Vincoli, and thereafter literally overwhelmed with <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, although during the lifetime of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> he never took a prominent part in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> diplomacy. He held the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> of Carpentras (1471-2), Lausanne (1472-6), <a href="../cathen/03429a.htm">Catania</a> (1473-4), Coutances (1476-7), Mende (1478-83), Viviers (1477-9), Sabina (1479-83), Bologna (1483-1502), <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> (1483-1503), Lod&egrave;ve (1488-9), Savona (1499-1502), <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> (1502-3), and the <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Archiepiscopal See of Avignon</a> (1474-1503). In addition he was commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Nonantola, Grottaferrata, and Gorze, and drew the revenues of various other <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>. These large incomes, however, he did not spend in vain pomp and dissipation, as was the custom of many <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> of those times. Giuliano was a patron of the <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a>, and spent most of his superfluous money in the erection of magnificent palaces and fortresses. Still his early private life was far from stainless, as is sufficiently testified by the fact that before he became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> he was the father of three daughters, the best known of whom, Felice, he gave in marriage to <a href="../cathen/11325b.htm">Giovanni Giordano Orsini</a> in 1506.

<p>In June, 1474, Giuliano was sent at the head of an army to restore the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority in Umbria. He succeeded in reducing Todi and <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, but for the subjugation of <a href="../cathen/03793c.htm">Citt&agrave; di Castello</a> he needed the assistance of Duke Federigo of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>. In February, 1476, he was sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to regulate the affairs of his <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Archdiocese of Avignon</a>, and probably to oppose the council which Louis XI intended to convene at <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>. In 1480 he was sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to accomplish three things, viz. to settle the quarrel concerning the <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> inheritance between Louis XI and Maximilian of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, to obtain the help of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and to effect the liberation of <a href="../cathen/02241b.htm">Cardinal Balue</a> whom Louis XI had held in strict custody since 1469 on account of treasonable acts. After successfully completing his mission he returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the beginning of 1482, accompanied by the liberated <a href="../cathen/02241b.htm">Cardinal Balue</a>. At that time a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was just breaking out between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> on one side and <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> on the other. Giuliano made various attempts to restore peace, and was probably instrumental in the dissolution of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Veneto</a>-<a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal</a> alliance on 12 December, 1482. He also protected the Colonna <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> against the cruel persecutions of Cardinal Girolamo Riario in 1484. After the death of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> on 12 August, 1484, Giuliano played a disreputable role in the election of <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>. Seeing that his own chances for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> were extremely meagre, he turned all his efforts to securing the election of a pope who was likely to be a puppet in his hands. Such a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> he saw in the weak and irresolute Cardinal Cibo, who owed his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> to Giuliano. To effect the election of his candidate he did not scruple to resort to bribery. Cibo ascended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne as <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> on 29 August, 1484, and was greatly influenced during the eight years of his pontificate by the strong and energetic Giuliano. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> that broke out between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and King Ferrante of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> must be attributed chiefly to Giuliano, and it was also due to him that it did not come to an earlier conclusion.

<p>After the death of <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> on 25 July, 1492, Giuliano again aspired to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, but his great influence during <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent's</a> pontificate and his pronounced sympathy for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had made him <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hateful</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. He was shrewd enough to understand the situation. He was, however, loath to see the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a> go to Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, not because the latter was an unworthy candidate, but on account of his personal aversion towards the Borgia. Despite Giuliano's efforts to the contrary, Rodrigo Borgia was the successful candidate, and ascended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne as <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> on 11 August, 1492. Fearing for his safety in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Giuliano withdrew to his strongly fortified castle at <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> towards the end of 1492. An apparent reconciliation between <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> and Giuliano was effected in July, 1493, but Giuliano did not trust in the sincerity of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and fled by way of <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> to the court of Charles VIII of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, whom he induced to make an expedition into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> with the purpose of dethroning <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>. Giuliano accompanied the king on his expedition, but by liberal concessions Alexander gained Charles to his side. In the treaty effected between them, it was stipulated that Giuliano should remain in possession of all his dignities and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, and should be guaranteed secure and undisturbed residence in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Giuliano, however, still feared the secret machinations of Alexander and returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Another apparent reconciliation took place in June, 1497, when Giuliano assisted the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the matrimonial affairs of Cesare Borgia. But Giuliano's distrust of Alexander remained. He evaded <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, spending most of his time in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.



<p>After the death of Alexander on 18 August, 1503, he returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 3 September to take part in the election of the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He was again a strong candidate for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, but his great <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> was not yet to be realized. The sick and aged Francesco Piccolomini ascended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne as <a href="../cathen/12128a.htm">Pius III</a>, but died on 18 October, 1503, after a reign of only twenty-six days. Giuliano's chance of being elected was now better than at any previous election. To ensure his success he made great promises to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and did not hesitate to employ bribery. The <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> began on 31 October, and after a few hours the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> united their votes on Giuliano, who as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> took the name of Julius II. It was the shortest <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> in the history of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. In the capitulation preceding the election, the following terms were secured by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>: (1) the continuation of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>; (2) the restoration of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> and the convocation of a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> for that purpose within two years; (3) that no <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was to be undertaken with another nation without the consent of two-thirds of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, who were to be consulted on all important matters, especially concerning the creation of new members for the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>; (4) that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with two-thirds of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> were to determine upon the place of the next general council. Such an unlawful restriction of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> no <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> could tolerate, much less the impatient, irascible, ambitious, and warlike Julius II, whose fearless and awe-inspiring presence gained for him the epithet of <em>pontefice terribile</em>. The chief task of his pontificate he saw in the firm establishment and the extension of the temporal power. For the accomplishment of this task no <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was ever better suited than Julius, whom nature and circumstances had hewn out for a soldier.

<p>Venice was the first to feel the strong hand of Julius II. Under pretence of humiliating Cesare Borgia, whom <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> had made Duke of the Romagna, the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> had reduced various places in the Romagna under their own authority. The Romagna was <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> territory, and every one of its cities added to the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> republic was lost to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. Julius, therefore, ordered Cesare Borgia to surrender the fortified places of the Romagna into his own hands. Cesare Borgia refused and was arrested by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> order. <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, however, stubbornly refused to give back the cities which it had previously taken. A temporary settlement was reached in March, 1505, when <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> restored most of its conquests in the Romagna. Meanwhile trouble was brewing at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> and Bologna, two cities that belonged to the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>. At <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> the Baglioni and at Bologna the <a href="../cathen/02483a.htm">Bentivogli</a> were acting as independent despots. The warlike Julius II personally directed the campaign against both, setting out at the head of his army on 26 August, 1506. <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> surrendered without any bloodshed on 13 September, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> proceeded towards Bologna. On 7 October he issued a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> deposing and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> Giovanni Bentivoglio and placing the city under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>. Bentivoglio fled, and Julius II entered Bologna triumphantly on 10 November. He did not leave the city until 22 February, 1507, arriving again at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 27 March.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> meanwhile continued to hold <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a> and <a href="../cathen/05751b.htm">Faenza</a>, two important places in the Romagna: they moreover encroached upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> by filling the vacant <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> in their territory independently of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and they subjected the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to the secular tribunal and in many other ways disrespected the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> of Julius II. Unable to cope alone with the powerful <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Republic of Venice</a>, he reluctantly joined the League of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> on 23 March, 1509. This League had been formed by Emperor Maximilian I and Louis XII of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> chiefly with the purpose of forcing <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to restore its recent continental conquests to their original owners. On 27 April, 1509, Julius II placed <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> and dispatched his troops into the Romagna. <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> was too weak to contend against the combined forces of the League, and suffered a complete defeat at the battle of Agnadello on 14 May, 1509. The <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> were now ready to enter negotiations with Julius II, who withdrew from the League and freed the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> from the ban on 24 February, 1510, after they agreed upon the following terms. (1) to restore the disputed towns in the Romagna; (2) to renounce their claims to fill vacant <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>; (3) to acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunal for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and exempt them from taxes; (4) to revoke all treaties made with <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> cities; (5) to permit <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> subjects free navigation on the Adriatic.

<p>Julius II was now again supreme temporal master over the entire <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>, but his national <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> extended beyond the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Patrimony of St. Peter</a>. His <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> was to free the whole of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> from its subjection to foreign powers, and especially to deliver it from the galling yoke of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. His efforts to gain the assistance of Emperor Maximilian, <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII of England</a>, and Ferdinand of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> futile for the moment, but the <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> were ready to take the field against the French. Julius II inaugurated the hostilities by deposing and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> his vassal, Duke Alfonso of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, who supported <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Louis XII retaliated by convoking a synod of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> in September, 1510, where it was decreed that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon a foreign prince, and, in case he should undertake such a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, the foreign prince had the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to invade the Ecclesiastical States and to withdraw his subjects from their obedience to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The synod also threatened the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>. Taking no notice of this synod, Julius again assumed personal command of his army and set out for Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. At Bologna he fell severely sick, and would probably have been captured by the French had it not been for the timely appearance of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>. He had scarcely recovered, when, braving the inclemency of the weather, he marched against Mirandola which he took on 20 January, 1511. On 23 May, 1511, the French made a descent upon Bologna which Julius II had left nine days previously, drove out the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> troops and reinstated the <a href="../cathen/02483a.htm">Bentivogli</a>.

<p>Some of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> were displeased with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> anti-French policy, and five of them went so far as to convoke a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> council at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> on 1 September. They were supported in their <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> by the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and for some time also by Emperor Maximilian. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> now looked for aid to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but before completing negotiations with these powers he fell dangerously sick. From 25 to 27 August, 1511, his life was despaired of. It was during this sickness of Julius II that Emperor Maximilian conceived the fantastic plan of uniting the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a> with the imperial crown on his own head (see Schulte, "Kaiser Maximilian als Kandidat f&uuml;r den papstlichen Stuhl", Leipzig, 1906; and Naegle, "Hat Kaiser Maximilian I in Jahre 1507 Papst werden wollen" in "Historisches Jahrbuch", XXVIII, <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>, 1907, pp. 44-60, 278-305). But Julius II recovered on 28 August, and on 4 October the so-called Holy League was formed for the purpose of delivering <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> from French rule. In the beginning the League included only the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, but <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> joined it on 17 November, and was soon followed by the emperor and by <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>. Under the leadership of the brilliant Gaston de Foix the French were at first successful, but after his death they had to yield to the superior forces of the League, and, being defeated in the bloody battle of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> on 11 April, 1512, they were driven beyond the Alps. Bologna again submitted to Julius II and the cities of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, <a href="../cathen/12717a.htm">Reggio</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> were added to the Ecclesiastical States.

<p>Julius II was chiefly a soldier, and the fame attached to his name is greatly due to his re-establishment of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a> and the deliverance of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> from its subjection to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Still he did not forget his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as the spiritual head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He was free from nepotism; heard Mass almost daily and often celebrated it himself; issued a strict <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> against <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> at papal elections and another against <a href="../cathen/05184b.htm">duels</a>; erected <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the recently discovered American colonies of <a href="../cathen/07114a.htm">Haiti</a> (Espanola), <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">San Domingo</a>, and Porto Rico; condemned the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Piero de Lucca concerning the Incarnation on 7 September, 1511; made various ordinances for monastic reforms; instituted the still existing Capella Julia, a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> chant which was to serve as a feeder for the Capella Palatina; and finally convoked the <a href="../cathen/09018b.htm">Fifth Lateran Council</a> to eradicate abuses from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and especially from the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, and to frustrate the designs of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who had convened their unsuccessful council first at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, then at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> (see <a href="../cathen/09016a.htm">LATERAN COUNCILS</a>). Julius II has also gained an enviable reputation as a patron of arts. <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a>, <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a> gave to the world some of their greatest masterpieces while in his service. He laid the cornerstone of the gigantic <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Basilica of St. Peter</a> on 18 April, 1506, and conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of uniting the Vatican with the Belvedere, engaging <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a> to accomplish the project. The famous frescoes of <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a> in the Sistine Chapel and of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> in the Stanze, the Court of St. Damasus with its loggias, the Via Giulia and Via della Lungara, the colossal <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Moses which <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> the mausoleum of Julius II in the church of San Pietro in Vincoli, and many other magnificent works in and out of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> are lasting witnesses of his great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of art.
