<h1>Pope Julius III</h1>  

<p>(GIAMMARIA CIOCCHI DEL MONTE).

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 10 September, 1487; died there, 23 March, 1555. He was the son of a famous Roman jurist, studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> and <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> under the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Ambrosius Catharinus. In 1512 he succeeded his uncle Antonio del Monte as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Siponto (Manfredonia), and in 1520 as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, retaining, however, the administration of Siponto. Later he became vice-legate of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, and under <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> was twice appointed prefect of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. After the Sack of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1527) he was one of the hostages given by <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> to the Imperialists, and would have been killed by the imperial Landsknechte in the Campo di Fiori, had he not been secretly liberated by Cardinal Pompio Colonna. In 1534 he became <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of Bologna, the Romagna, <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>. <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a> created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of SS. Vitalis, Gervasius, and Protasius on 22 December, 1536, and raised him to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishop</a> with the <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Diocese of Palestrina</a> on 5 October, 1543. As early as 1542 he had been entrusted with work preparatory to the convocation of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and in a consistory held on 6 February, 1545, he was appointed first president of the council. In this capacity he opened the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">council at Trent</a> on 13 December with a short oration (cf. Ehses, "Concilium Tridentinum", IV, Freiburg im Br., 1904, p. 516). At the council he represented the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> interests against <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>, with whom he came in conflict on various occasions, especially when on 26 March, 1547, he transferred the Council to Bologna.

<p>After the death of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> on 10 November, 1549, the forty-eight <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> present in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> entered the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> on 29 November. They were divided into three factions: the Imperials, the French, and the adherents of Farnese. The friends of Farnese united with the Imperial party and proposed <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Reginald Pole</a> and Juan de Toledo as their candidates. The French party rejected both and, though in the minority, they were strong enough to prevent the election of either candidate. The adherents of Farnese and the French party finally reached a compromise and agreed upon Cardinal del Monte, who was duly elected on 7 February, 1550, after a <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of ten weeks, although the emperor had expressly excluded him from the list of candidates. The new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> took the name of Julius III. In fulfilment of promises made in the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, Julius restored <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> to Ottavio Farnese a few days after his accession. But, when Farnese applied to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> for aid against the emperor, Julius allied himself with the emperor, declared Farnese deprived of his fief, and sent troops under the command of his nephew Giambattista del Monte to co-operate with Duke Gonzaga of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> in the capture of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>. In a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 13 November, 1550, Julius transferred the council from Bologna back to <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, and ordered that its sessions be resumed on 1 May, 1551, but he was compelled to suspend it again on 15 April, 1552, because the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> would take no part in it, and, to escape his enemies, the emperor had to flee from Innsbruck. The success of the French arms in Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> also compelled Julius on 29 April, 1552, to make a truce with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in which it was stipulated that Farnese was to remain in the peaceful possession of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> for two years.

<p>Discouraged at his failure as an ally of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> henceforth abstained from interfering in the political affairs of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He withdrew to his luxurious palace, the Villa Giulia, which he had erected at the Porta del Popolo. Here he spent most of his time in ease and comfort, occasionally making a weak effort at reform in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by instituting a few committees of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> for reformatory purposes. He was a liberal supporter of the rising <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Order</a>, and at the instance of St. Ignatius issued the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of foundation for the <em>Collegium Germanicum</em> on 31 August, 1552, and granted it an annual subsidy. During his pontificate the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion was temporarily restored in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> by <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Queen Mary</a>, who succeeded Edward VI on the English throne in 1553. Julius sent <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Reginald Pole</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> with extensive faculties to be used at his discretion in the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> restoration. In February, 1555, an embassy was sent by the English Parliament to Julius III to inform him of its unreserved submission to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy, but the embassy was still on its journey when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> died. Shortly before his death Julius III sent <a href="../cathen/10575a.htm">Cardinal Morone</a> to represent the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interest at the Religious Peace of Augsburg. At the beginning of his pontificate Julius III had the earnest desire to bring about a reform in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and with this intent he reopened the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. That the council was again suspended was due to the force of circumstances. His inactivity during the last three years of his pontificate may have been caused by the frequent and severe attacks of the gout to which he was subject. The great blemish in his pontificate was nepotism. Shortly after his accession he bestowed the purple on his unworthy favourite Innocenzo del Monte, a youth of seventeen whom he had picked up on the streets of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> some years previously, and who had been adopted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> brother, Balduino. This act gave rise to some very disagreeable rumours concerning the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> relation to Innocenzo. Julius was also extremely lavish in bestowing <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a> and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> upon his relatives.
