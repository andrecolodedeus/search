<h1>Pope Leo V</h1>  

<p>Very little is known of him. We have no <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> either as to when he was elected or as to exactly how long he reigned. It is highly probable that he was <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> during August, 903. He was a native of Priapi, a small place in the district of Ardea. When chosen he was not one of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but was attached to some church outside the City. Hence, in contemporary catalogues of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> he is called a <em>presbiter forensis</em>. Auxilius, a writer of the time, says that he held "the rudder of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy Roman Church</a>" for thirty days, and that "he was a man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of praiseworthy life and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>." Except that he issued a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> exempting the canons of Bologna from the payment of taxes, we know of nothing that he did as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The circumstances of his death are as obscure as those of his life. After a pontificate of somewhat over a month he was seized by Christopher, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of St. Damasus, and cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. The intruder promptly seated himself in the chair of Peter, but was soon after displaced by <a href="../cathen/13729a.htm">Sergius III</a>. According to one authority, <a href="../cathen/13729a.htm">Sergius</a> took "pity" on the two <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> pontiffs, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> them both to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. However, it seems more likely that Leo died a natural death in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> or in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>.
