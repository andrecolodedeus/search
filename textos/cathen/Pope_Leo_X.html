<h1>Pope Leo X</h1>  

<p>(G<font size=-2>IOVANNI DE</font> M<font size=-2>EDICI</font>).

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 11 December, 1475; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 1 December, 1521, was the second son of Lorenzo the Magnificent (1449-1492) and Clarice Orsini, and from his earliest youth was destined for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He received <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a> in 1482 and in 1483 was made <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Font Douce in the French Diocese of Saintes and appointed <a href="../cathen/12503a.htm">Apostolic prothonotary</a> by <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>. All the <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> which the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a> could obtain were at his disposal; he consequently became possessed of the rich Abbey of Passignano in 1484 and in 1486 of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>. Owing to the constant pressure brought to bear by Lorenzo and his envoys, <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> in 1489, created the thirteen year-old child a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, on condition that he should dispense with the insignia and the privilege of his office for three years. Meanwhile his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was completed by the most distinguished <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanists</a> and scholars, Angelo Poliziano, <a href="../cathen/06067b.htm">Marsilio Ficino</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02542a.htm">Bernardo Dovizi</a> (later Cardinal Bibbiena). From 1489 to 1491 Giovanni de' Medici studied <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and canon law, at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, under Filippo Decio and Bartolomeo Sozzini. On 9 March, 1492, at <a href="../cathen/06070a.htm">Fiesole</a>, he was invested with the insignia of a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and on 22 March entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The next day the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> received him in consistory with the customary ceremonies. The Romans found the youthful <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> more mature than his age might warrant them to expect. His father sent him an impressive letter of advice marked by good sense and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, besides bearing witness to the high and virtuous sentiments to which the elder Lorenzo returned towards the end of his life. In this letter he enjoins upon his son certain rules of conduct, and admonishes him to be honourable, virtuous, and exemplary, the more so as the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">College of Cardinals</a> at that time was deficient in these good qualities.

<p>In the very next month Lorenzo's death recalled the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> to <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>. He returned once more to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the <a href="../cathen/11456a.htm">papal election</a>, which resulted, very much against his approval, in the elevation of the unworthy <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>, after which Giovanni remained in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a> from August, 1492, until the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a> in 1494, when he fled from his native city in the habit of a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. After several fruitless attempts to restore the supremacy of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, he led the life of a literary and artistic amateur. Patronage, liberality, and poor financial administration frequently reduced him even then to distressing straits; indeed, he remained a bad manager to the last. But though his manner of life was quite worldly he excelled in dignity, propriety, and irreproachable conduct most of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. Towards the end of the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> (1503-1513), fortune once more smiled on Giovanni de' Medici. In August, 1511, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was dangerously ill and the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> already aspired to the succession. In October, 1511, he became <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in Bologna and Romagna, and cherished the hope that his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> would again rule in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florentines</a> had taken the part of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisans</a> (see <strong>J<font size=-2>ULIUS</font> II</strong>) for which reason the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> supported the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a>. Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> suffered another reverse. The army, Spanish and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a>, with which he was sojourning, was defeated in 1512 at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> by the French and he was taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>. But it was a Pyrrhic victory, for the French soon lost all their possessions in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, who was to have been taken to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, succeeded in making his escape. The supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a> in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a> was re-established in September, 1512, and this unexpected change in the fortunes of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was only the prelude to higher honours.

<p><a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> died on 21 February, 1513, and on 11 March Giovanni de' Medici, then but thirty-eight years old, was elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In the first <a href="../cathen/13641a.htm">scrutiny</a> he received only one vote. His adherents, the younger <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, held back his candidacy until the proper moment. The <a href="../cathen/11456a.htm">election</a> met with approval even in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, although here and there a natural misgiving was felt as to whether the youthful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> would prove equal to his burden. In many quarters high hopes were placed in him by politicians who relied on his pliancy, by scholars and artists of whom he was already a patron, and by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> who looked for energetic church reforms under a pacific ruler. Unfortunately he realized the hopes only of the artists, literati, and worldlings who looked upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court as a centre of amusement.

<p>Leo's personal appearance has been perpetuated for us in <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> celebrated picture at the Pitti Gallery in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, which represents him with Cardinals Medici and Rossi. He was not a handsome man. His fat, shiny, effeminate countenance with weak eyes protrudes in the picture from under a close-fitting cap. The unwieldy body is supported by thin legs. His movements were sluggish and during <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions his corpulence made him constantly wipe the perspiration from his face and hands, to the distress of the bystanders. But when he laughed or spoke the unpleasant impression vanished. He had an agreeable voice, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to express himself with elegance and vivacity, and his manner was easy and gracious. "Let us enjoy the papacy since God has given it to us", he is said to have remarked after his <a href="../cathen/11456a.htm">election</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> ambassador who related this of him was not unbiased, nor was he in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the time, nevertheless the phrase illustrates fairly the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> pleasure-loving nature and the lack of seriousness that characterized him. He paid no attention to the dangers threatening the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, and gave himself up unrestrainedly to amusements, that were provided in lavish abundance. He was possessed by an insatiable love of pleasure, that distinctive trait of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Music, the theatre, art, and poetry appealed to him as to any pampered worldling. Though temperate himself, he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> to give banquets and expensive entertainments, accompanied by revelry and carousing; and notwithstanding his indolence he had a strong passion for the chase, which he conducted every year on the largest scale. From his youth he was an enthusiastic lover of music and attracted to his court the most distinguished musicians. At table he enjoyed hearing improvisations and though it is hard to believe, in view of his dignity and his artistic tastes, the fact remains that he enjoyed also the flat and absurd jokes of buffoons. Their loose speech and incredible <a href="../cathen/01656a.htm">appetites</a> delighted him. In ridicule and caricature he was himself a master. Pageantry, dear to the pleasure-seeking Romans, bull-fights, and the like, were not neglected. Every year he amused himself during the carnival with masques, music, theatrical performances, dances, and races. Even during the troubled years of 1520 he took part in unusually brilliant festivities. Theatrical representations, with agreeable music and graceful dancing, were his favourite diversions. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> palace became a theatre and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did not hesitate to attend such improper plays as the immoral "Calendra" by Bibbiena and <a href="../cathen/01712b.htm">Ariosto's</a> indecent "Suppositi". His contemporaries all praised and admired Leo's unfailing good temper, which he never entirely lost even in adversity and trouble. Himself cheerful, he wished to see others cheerful. He was good-natured and liberal and never refused a favour either to his relatives and fellow <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florentines</a>, who flooded <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and seized upon all official positions, or to the numerous other petitioners, artists and poets. His generosity was boundless, nor was his pleasure in giving a pose or desire for vainglory; it came from the heart. He never was ostentatious and attached no importance to ceremonial. He was lavish in <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>; <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, discharged soldiers, poor students, <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, exiles, cripples, the blind, the sick, the unfortunate of every description were generously remembered, and more than 6000 ducats were annually distributed in <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>.



<p>Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that the large treasure left by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> was entirely dissipated in two years. In the spring of 1515 the exchequer was empty and Leo never after recovered from his financial embarrassment. Various <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> and reprehensible methods were resorted to for raising money. He created new offices and dignities, and the most exalted places were put up for sale. Jubilees and <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> were degraded almost entirely into financial transactions, yet without avail, as the treasury was ruined. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> income amounted to between 500,000 and 600,000 ducats. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> household alone, which <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> had maintained on 48,000 ducats, now cost double that sum. In all, Leo spent about four and a half million ducats during his pontificate and left a <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> amounting to 400,000 ducats. On his unexpected death his creditors faced financial ruin. A lampoon proclaimed that "Leo X had consumed three pontificates; the treasure of <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, the revenues of his own reign, and those of his successor." It is proper, however, to pay full credit to the good qualities of Leo. He was highly cultivated, susceptible to all that was beautiful, a polished orator and a clever writer, possessed of good memory and judgment, in manner dignified and majestic. It was generally acknowledged, even by those who were unfriendly towards him, that he was unfeignedly religious and strictly fulfilled his spiritual <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. He heard Mass and read his <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> daily and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasted</a> three times a week. His <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> cannot truly be described as deep or spiritual, but that does not justify the continued repetition of his alleged remark: "How much we and our <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> have profited by the legend of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, is sufficiently evident to all ages." John Bale, the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> English <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, the first to give currency to these words in the time of Queen Elizabeth, was not even a contemporary of Leo. Among the many sayings of Leo X that have come down to us, there is not one of a sceptical nature. In his private life he preserved as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the irreproachable reputation that he had borne when a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. His character shows a remarkable mingling of good and bad traits.

<p>The fame of Leo X is due to his promotion of literature, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, and art. Under him <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> became more than ever the centre of the literary world. "From all parts", wrote Cardinal Riario in 1515 to <a href="../cathen/05510b.htm">Erasmus</a> at Rotterdam, "men of letters are hurrying to the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>, their common country, their support, and their patroness." Poets were especially numerous in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and few princes have been so lauded in verse as Leo X. He lavished gifts, favours, positions, titles, not only on real poets and scholars, but often on poetasters and commonplace jesters. He esteemed particularly the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> secretaries <a href="../cathen/02425e.htm">Bembo</a> and <a href="../cathen/13324a.htm">Sadoleto</a>, both celebrated poets and prose writers. <a href="../cathen/02425e.htm">Bembo</a> charmed everyone by his polish and wit. His classic Ciceronian letters exhibit a remarkably varied intercourse with almost all the celebrities of his day. Among other things, he prepared a critical edition of <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante's</a> works and was a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> collector of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, books, and works of art. His conduct was not in accord with his position as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> notary, count palatine, and incumbent of numerous <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, for he was worldly and self-indulgent. <a href="../cathen/13324a.htm">Sadoleto</a> was quite another man. He led a pure and spotless life, was a model <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, united in himself the different phases of ancient and modern culture and was an ardent enthusiast for antiquity. In elegance and polish he was in no way inferior to <a href="../cathen/02425e.htm">Bembo</a>. Among the Latin poets of Medicean <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> we may briefly mention Vida, who composed a poem of great merit, the "Christiade" and was extolled by his contemporaries as the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Virgil; Sannazaro, author of an epic poem on the birth of Christ which is a model of style; the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> Spagnolo Mantovano with his "Calendar of Feasts"; Ferreri, who in the most na&#239;ve way recast the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> with <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> terms, images, and allusions. The total number of these poets exceeds one hundred; and a lampoon of 1521 says they were more numerous than the stars in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Most of them have fallen into well-deserved oblivion.

<p>This is equally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the contemporary Italian poetry&mdash;more prolific than notable. Among the Italian poets <a href="../cathen/15061a.htm">Trissino</a> wrote a tragedy, "Sophonisba", and an epic "L'Italia liberata dai Gothi", but had no real success with either in spite of earnest purpose and beauty of language. Rucellai, a relative of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, whose clever and sympathetic didactic poem on bees met with great approval from his contemporaries, owed his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> chiefly to an inferior work, the tragedy of "Rosmonda". The celebrated <em>improvisatore</em>, <a href="../cathen/14468b.htm">Tebaldeo</a> wrote in both Latin and Italian. Towards <a href="../cathen/01712b.htm">Ariosto</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was remarkably harsh. Arch&aelig;ology received great encouragement. One of its most distinguished representatives was Manetti. In 1521 the first collection of Roman topographical inscriptions appeared and introduced a new era. Important progress was due to the works of the learned antiquary, Fulvio. Fulvio, Calvo, <a href="../cathen/03409c.htm">Castiglione</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> had planned an arch&aelig;ological survey of ancient <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with accompanying text. <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> early death abruptly interrupted the work which was carried on by Fulvio and Calvo. The Greek language also found favour and encouragement; Aldus Manutius, the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> publisher, whose excellent and correct editions of Greek classics became so popular, was one of Leo's prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. <a href="../cathen/09010c.htm">Andreas Johannes Lascaris</a> and Musurus were summoned from <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and founded a Greek college, the "Medicean Academy". Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> encouraged the collection of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and books. He recovered his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> which had been sold by the <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florentines</a> in 1494 to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of San Marco, had it brought to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and enforced the regulations of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> for the Vatican Library. The most distinguished of his librarians was Inghirami, less indeed through any learned works than for his gift of eloquence. He was called the Cicero of his age and played an important r&ocirc;le at court. In 1516 he was succeeded by the Bolognese <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanist</a> Beroaldo. Leo tried, as <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a> had formerly done, to increase the treasures of the Vatican Library, and with this object sent emissaries in all directions, even to Scandinavia and the Orient, to discover literary treasures and either obtain them, or borrow them for the purpose of making copies. The results, however, were unimportant. The Roman <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, which had entered on decay, was reformed, but did not long flourish. On the whole, Leo, as a literary M&aelig;cenas, has been overrated by his biographer Giovio and later panegyrists. Relatively little was accomplished, partly on account of the constant lack of money and partly because of the thoughtlessness and haste which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> often showed in distributing his favours. He was in reality only a dilettante. Yet he gave an important stimulus to scientific and literary life, and was a potent factor in the cultural development of the West.

<p>More important results ensued from his promotion of art, though he was unquestionably inferior in taste and judgment to his predecessor <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>. Leo encouraged <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> beyond all other branches of art; pre-eminent in this class stand the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> productions of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>. In 1508 he had come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, summoned by <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, and remained there until his death in 1520. The protection extended to this master genius is Leo's most enduring claim on posterity. <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> achievements, already numerous and important, took on more dignity and grandeur under Leo. He <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a>, sketched, and engraved from antique works of art, modeled in clay, made designs for palaces, directed the work of others by order of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, gave advice and assistance alike to supervisors and workmen. "Everything pertaining to art the pope turns over to Raphael", wrote an ambassador in 1518. This is not, of course, the place to treat <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> prodigious activity. We limit ourselves to brief mention of a few of his works. He finished the decoration of the Vatican halls or "Stanze" begun under <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>, and in the third hall cleverly referred to Leo X by introducing scenes from the pontificates of <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a> and <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a>. A more important commission was given him to <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paint</a> the cartoons for the tapestries of the Sistine Chapel, the highest of <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> achievements, the most magnificent of them being "St. Peter's miraculous draught of fishes" and "St. Paul preaching in Athens". A third famous enterprise was the decoration of the Vatican Loggia done by <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael's</a> pupils under his direction, and mostly from his designs. The most exquisite of his <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> are the wonderful Sistine Madonna and the "Transfiguration". Sculpture showed a marked decline under Leo X. <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michaelangelo</a> offered his services and worked from 1516 to 1520 on a marble fa&#231;ade for the church of San Lorenzo in <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, but did not finish it. On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> gave especial attention and encouragement to the minor arts, e.g. decorative carving, and furthered the industrial arts. The greatest and most difficult task of Leo was in the field of architecture and was inherited from his predecessor, viz., the continuation of the new St. Peter's. <a href="../cathen/02736a.htm">Bramante</a> remained its chief architect until his death in 1514. <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> succeeded him, but in his six years of office little was done, much to his regret, through lack of means.

<p>We may now turn to the political and religious events of Leo's pontificate. Here the bright splendour that diffuses itself over his literary and artistic patronage, is soon changed to deepest gloom. His well-known peaceable inclinations made the political situation a disagreeable heritage, and he tried to maintain tranquillity by exhortations, to which, however, no one listened. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> desired to wreak vengeance for the defeat of 1512 and to reconquer <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> entered into an alliance with her, whereupon Emperor Maximilian, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in 1513 concluded a Holy League against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> wished at first to remain neutral but such a course would have isolated him, so he decided to be faithful to the policy of his predecessors and sought accordingly to oppose the designs of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but in doing so, to avoid severity. In 1513 the French were decisively routed at <a href="../cathen/11134b.htm">Novara</a> and were forced to effect a reconciliation with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> (see <strong>J<font size=-2>ULIUS</font> II</strong>) submitted and were pardoned, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> then took part in the Lateran Council which Leo had continued.

<p>But success was soon clouded by uncertainty. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> endeavoured to form an alliance with <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and to obtain <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a> by a matrimonial alliance. Leo feared for the independence of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a> and for the so-called freedom of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He negotiated on all sides without committing himself, and in 1514 succeeded in bringing about an Anglo-French alliance. The fear of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> now gave way to the bugbear of French supremacy and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> began negotiating in a deceitful and disloyal manner with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and her enemies simultaneously. Before he had decided to bind himself in one way or the other, Louis XII died and the young and ardent <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> succeeded him. Once more Leo sought delay. He supported the League against <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, but until the last moment hoped for an arrangement with <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis</a>. But the latter shortly after his descent upon <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, won the great victory of Marignano, 13-14 September, 1515, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> now made up his mind to throw himself into the arms of the Most Christian King and beg for mercy. He was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to alter his policy completely and to abandon to the French king <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> and <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, which had been reunited with <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. An interview with <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">King Francis</a> at Bologna resulted in the French Concordat (1516), that brought with it such important consequences for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a> of <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> (1438), deeply inimical to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, was revoked, but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> paid a high price for this concession, when he granted to the king the right of <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> to all the sees, <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Through this and other concessions, e.g. that pertaining to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a>, the royal influence over the French Church was assured. Great discontent resulted in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and in the parliaments. The abolition of the <a href="../cathen/12333a.htm">Pragmatic Sanction</a>, drawn up in compliance with the decrees of the Council of Basle, affected the adherents of the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">conciliar</a> system of church government. The abolition of free <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> elections affected grievously the interests of many and opposition to the Concordat was maintained for centuries. The advantage to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of such a great sacrifice was that <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, hitherto <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> in attitude, now stood firmly bound to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, which thus turned aside the danger of complete estrangement. However, the way in which the French crown abused its control over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> led at a later period to great evils.

<p>Meanwhile the Lateran Council, continued by Leo after his elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, was nearing its close, having issued numerous and very timely decrees, e.g. against the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> teachings of the Paduan professor, Pietro Pompanazzi, who denied the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The encroachments of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanism</a> on the spiritual life were met by the simultaneous rise of a new order of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies. In the ninth session was <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> that treated exhaustively of reforms in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Abbeys and <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> were henceforth to be bestowed only on <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of merit and according to canon law. Provisions of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> and consistorial proceedings were regulated; <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> depositions and transfers made more difficult; commendatory <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> were forbidden; and unions and reservations of <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, also <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> for obtaining them, were restricted. Measures were also taken for reforming the curial administration and the lives of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. The religious instruction of children was declared a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. Blasphemers and incontinent, negligent, or <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniac</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> were to be severely punished. Church revenues were no longer to be turned to secular uses. The <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> must be respected, and all kinds of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> abolished. The eleventh session dealt with the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>, particularly with preaching. These measures, unhappily, were not thoroughly enforced, and therefore the much-needed genuine reform was not realized. Towards the close of the council (1517) the noble and highly cultured <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola, delivered a remarkable speech on the necessity of a reform of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>; his account of the moral condition of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> is saddening, and reveals the many and great difficulties that stood in the way of a genuine reform. He concluded with the warning that if Leo X left such offences longer unpunished and refused to apply healing remedies to these wounds of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it was to be feared that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself would cut off the rotten limbs and destroy them with fire and sword. That very year this prophetic warning was verified. The salutary reforms of the Lateran Council found no practical acceptance. Pluralism, commendatory <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>, and the granting of <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a> to children remained customary. Leo himself did not scruple to set aside repeatedly the decrees of the council. The <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, then much despised and against which so many inveighed with <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, remained as worldly as ever. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was either unwilling or not in a position to regulate the unworthy and immoral conduct of many of the Roman courtiers. The political situation absorbed his attention and was largely responsible for the premature close of the council.

<p>In March, 1516, Emperor Maximilian crossed the Alps to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on the French and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> followed his usual course of shifting and dissimulation. At first, when events seemed favourable for the French, he supported <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis</a>. But his former double-dealing had left <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis</a> in such ill-humour that he now adhered to an antipapal policy, whereupon Leo adopted an unfriendly attitude towards the king. Their relations were further strained apropos of the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>. During the French invasion the Duke of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a> had withheld the assistance which he was in <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> bound to render the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who now exiled him and gave the title to his nephew, Lorenzo de' Medici. The French king was highly displeased with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> policy, and when <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> and Maximilian formed the alliance of <a href="../cathen/03209c.htm">Cambrai</a> in 1517 and agreed on a partition of Upper and Central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Pope Leo found himself in a disagreeable position. In part by reason of his constant vacillation he had drifted into a dangerous isolation, added to which the Duke of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a> reconquered his duchy; to crown all other calamities came a conspiracy of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> life. The ringleader, Cardinal Petrucci, was a young worldly ecclesiastic who thought only of money and pleasure. He and the other <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who had brought about Leo's selection, made afterwards such numerous and insistent demands that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> could not yield to them. Other causes for discontent were found in the unfortunate <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a> and in the abolition of the election capitulations and the excessive privileges of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. Petrucci bore personal ill-will towards the "ungrateful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>", who had removed his brother from the government of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>. He tried to have the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> poisoned by a physician, but suspicion was aroused and the plot was betrayed through a letter. The investigation implicated Cardinals Sauli, Riario, Soderini, and Castellesi; they had been guilty at least of listening to Petrucci, and perhaps had desired his success, though their full complicity was not actually <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. Petrucci was executed and the others punished by fines; Riario paid the enormous sum of 150,000 ducats.

<p>The affair throws a lurid light on the degree of corruption in the highest <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> circles. Unconcerned by the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> he was giving, Leo took advantage of the proceeding to create thirty-one new <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, thereby obtaining an entirely submissive college and also money to carry on the unlucky <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>. Not a few of these <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> were chosen on account of the large sums they advanced. But this wholesale appointment also brought several virtuous and distinguished men into the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, and it was further important because it definitively established the superiority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> over the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a>, encouraged by <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> and Maximilian for the purpose of increasing Leo's difficulties, was finally brought to a close, after having cost enormous sums and emptied the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> treasury. Lorenzo de' Medici remained in possession of the duchy (1517). Faithful to the ancient tradition of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, from the very beginning of his reign, Leo <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> advocated a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, and at the close of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a> took up the cause with renewed determination. In November, 1517, he submitted an exhaustive memorial to all the princes of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and endeavored to unite them in a common effort, but in vain. The replies of the powers <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> widely dissimilar. They were suspicious of one another and each sought naturally to realize various secondary purposes of its own. Leo answered a threatening letter from the sultan by active exertions. Religious processions were held, a truce of five years was proclaimed throughout <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> was preached (1518). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> showed real earnestness, but his great plan miscarried through lack of cooperation on the part of the powers. Moreover, <a href="../cathen/15685a.htm">Cardinal Wolsey</a>, Lord Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, thwarted the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> peaceful efforts and thus dealt a grievous blow to the international prestige of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> was preached in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, it found a large section of the people strongly predisposed against the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>, and furnished them with an occasion to express their views in plain terms. It was believed that the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> merely sought to obtain more money. One of the numerous spiteful pamphlets issued declared that the real <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> were in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and that these demons could only be pacified by streams of gold. The good cause was gradually merged with an important political question, the succession to the imperial throne. Maximilian sought the election for his grandson, <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles of Spain</a>. A rival appeared in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a>, and both he and <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles</a> vied with each other in seeking to win the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> favour by repeated assurances of their willingness to move against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. The event of the election relegated the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> to the background. In 1519 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> realized that there was no longer any prospect of carrying out his design.

<p>Leo's attitude towards the imperial succession was influenced primarily by his anxiety concerning the power and independence of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the so-called freedom of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Neither candidate was acceptable to him, <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles</a>, if possible, less than <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis</a>, owing to the preponderance of power that must result from his accession. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> would have preferred a German electoral prince, that of <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a> or later, the Elector of Brandenburg. He "sailed", as usual, "with two compasses", held both rivals at bay by a double game played with matchless skill, and even succeeded in concluding simultaneously an alliance with both. The deceitfulness and insincerity of his political dealings cannot be entirely excused, either by the difficult position in which he was placed or by the example of his secular contemporaries. Maximilian's death (January, 1519) ended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> irresolution. First he tried to defeat both candidates by raising up a German elector. Then he worked <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> for <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> in the endeavour to secure his firm friendship in case <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles</a> became emperor, an event which grew daily more likely. Only at the last moment when the election of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles</a> was certain and unavoidable did Leo come over to his side; after the election he watched in great anxiety the attitude the new emperor might assume.

<p>The most important occurrence of Leo's pontificate and that of gravest consequence to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, which began in 1517. We cannot enter into a minute account of this movement, the remote cause of which lay in the religious, political, and social conditions of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, however, that the seeds of discontent amid which <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> threw his firebrand had been germinating for centuries. The immediate cause was bound up with the odious <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">greed</a> for money displayed by the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, and shows how far short all efforts at reform had hitherto fallen. <a href="../cathen/01262a.htm">Albert of Brandenburg</a>, already <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>, received in addition the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and the Bishopric of Hallerstadt, but in return was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to collect 10,000 ducats, which he was taxed over and above the usual confirmation fees. To indemnify hiim, and to make it possible to discharge these <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> permitted him to have preached in his territory the plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> promised all those who contributed to the new St. Peter's; he was allowed to keep one half the returns, a transaction which brought dishonour on all concerned in it. Added to this, abuses occurred during the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a>. The money contributions, a mere accessory, were frequently the chief object, and the "Indulgences for the Dead" became a vehicle of inadmissible teachings. That Leo X, in the most serious of all the crises which threatened the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, should fail to prove the proper guide for her, is clear enough from what has been related above. He recognized neither the gravity of the situation nor the underlying causes of the revolt. Vigorous measures of reform might have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> an efficacious antidote, but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was deeply entangled in political affairs and allowed the imperial election to overshadow the revolt of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>; moreover, he gave himself up unrestrainedly to his pleasures and failed to grasp fully the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his high office.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> last political efforts were directed to expanding the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>, establishing a dominating power in central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> by means of the acquisition of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. In 1519 he concluded a treaty with <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> against <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Emperor Charles V</a>. But the selfishness and encroachments of the French and the struggle against the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran movement</a>, induced him soon to unite with <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles</a>, after he had again resorted to his double-faced method of treating with both rivals. In 1521 <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">emperor</a> signed a defensive alliance for the purpose of driving the French out of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. After some difficulty, the allies occupied <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>. Amid the rejoicings over these successes, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> died suddenly of a malignant malaria. His enemies are wrongly accused of having poisoned him. The magnificent <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was given a simple funeral and not until the reign of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> was a monument erected to his memory in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Santa Maria sopra Minerva. It is cold, prosaic, and quite unworthy of such a connoisseur as Leo.

<p>The only possible verdict on the pontificate of Leo X is that it was unfortunate for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Sigismondo Tizio, whose devotion to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> is undoubted, writes truthfully: "In the general opinion it was injurious to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that her Head should delight in plays, music, the chase and nonsense, instead of paying serious attention to the needs of his flock and mourning over their misfortunes". <a href="../cathen/12798b.htm">Von Reumont</a> says pertinently&mdash;"Leo X is in great measure to blame for the fact that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the integrity and merit of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, in its moral and regenerating powers, and even in its good intentions, should have sunk so low that men could declare extinct the old <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> spirit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>."
