<h1>Pope Leo XIII</h1>  

<p>Born 2 March, 1810, at Carpineto; elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> 20 February, 1878; died 20 July, 1903, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Gioacchino Vincenzo Raffaele Luigi was the sixth of the seven sons of Count Lodovico Pecci and his wife Anna Prosperi-Buzi. There was some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the nobility of the Pecci <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and when the young Gioacchino sought admission to the Accademia dei Nobili in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he met with a certain opposition, whereupon he wrote the history of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, showing that the Pecci of Carpineto were a branch of the Pecci of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to <a href="../cathen/10291a.htm">emigrate</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a> in the first half of the sixteenth century, under <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>, because they had sided with the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a>.

<p>At the age of eight, together with his brother Giuseppe, aged ten, he was sent to study at the new <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, the present <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>. He remained there six years (1818-24), and gained that classical facility in the use of Latin and Italian afterwards justly admired in his official writings and his poems. Much credit for this is due to his teacher, Padre Leonardo Garibaldi. When, in 1824, the Collegio Romano was given back to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Gioacchino and his brother Giuseppe entered as students of humanities and rhetoric. At the end of his rhetoric course Gioacchino was chosen to deliver the address in Latin, and selected as his subject, "The Contrast between Pagan and Christian <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>". Not less successful was his three years' course of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>.

<p>He remained yet uncertain as to his calling, though it had been the wish of his mother that he should embrace the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>. Like many other young Romans of the period who aimed at a public career, he took up meanwhile the study of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> as well as canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. Among his professors were the famous <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> <a href="../cathen/11702b.htm">Perrone</a> and the scripturist <a href="../cathen/11559a.htm">Patrizi</a>. In 1832 he obtained the doctorate of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, whereupon, after the difficulties referred to above, he asked and obtained admission to the Academy of Noble Ecclesiastics, and entered upon the study of canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> at the Sapienza University. Thanks to his talents, and to the protection of Cardinals Sala and <a href="../cathen/11380b.htm">Pacca</a>, he was appointed domestic <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> by <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> in January, 1837, while still in <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>, and in March of that year was made "referendario della Segnatura", which office he soon exchanged for one in the Congregazione del Buon Governo, or Ministry of the Interior for the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>, of which his protector Cardinal Sala was at that time prefect. During the cholera epidemic in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he ably assisted Cardinal Sala in his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as overseer of all the city <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. His <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and ability convinced Cardinal Sala that Pecci was fitted for larger responsibilities, and he again urged him to enter the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, hinting in addition that before long he might be promoted to a post where the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> would be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Yielding to these solicitations, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 31 Dec., 1837, by <a href="../cathen/11206b.htm">Cardinal Odeschalchi</a>, Vicar of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Stanislaus on the Quirinal. The post hinted at by Cardinal Sala was that of Delegate or civil Governor of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, a city subject to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> but situated in the heart of the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>. Its condition was very unsatisfactory; the brigands of the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> territory infested the country in great numbers, survivals of the Napoleonic Wars and the guerrilla of the Sanfedisti. <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> thought a young and energetic delegate <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. <a href="../cathen/08760b.htm">Cardinal Lambruschini</a>, secretary of state, and Cardinal Sala suggested the name of Mgr. Pecci, who set out for <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> 2 February, 1838. On his recovery from an attack of typhoid fever, he set to work to stamp out brigandage, and soon his vigilance, indomitable purpose, and fearless treatment of the nobles who protected the brigands and smugglers, pacified the whole province. Aided by the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, Mgr. di Pietro, the youthful delegate drew up an agreement with the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> police for united action against brigands. He also turned his attention to the roads and highways, and arranged for a more just distribution of taxes and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, until then the same as those imposed by the invading French, and, though exorbitant, exacted with the greatest rigour. Meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> were discussing the exchange of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> for a stretch of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> territory bordering on the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>. When Mgr. Pecci heard of this he memorialized the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> so strongly against it that the negotiations were broken off.

<p>The results obtained in three years by the delegate at <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> led <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> to entrust another delegation to him where a strong <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> was required, though for very different reasons. He was first destined for <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, but on 17 July, 1841, he was sent to <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, a hotbed of the anti-papal revolutionary party. For three years he improved the material conditions of his territory and introduced a more expeditious and economical administration of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. He also began a savings bank to assist small tradesmen and farmers with loans at a low rate of interest, reformed <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> methods, and was otherwise active for the common welfare.

<p>In January, 1843, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, as successor of Mgr. Fornari, appointed <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. On 19 Feb., he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> titular <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Damiata by <a href="../cathen/08760b.htm">Cardinal Lambruschini</a>, and set out for his post. On his arrival he found rather critical conditions. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> question was warmly debated between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> majority and the Liberal minority. He encouraged the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> in their struggle for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, yet he was able to win the good will of the Court, not only of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Queen Louise, but also of King Leopold I, strongly Liberal in his views. The new <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> succeeded in uniting the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and to him is owing the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> college in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1844). He made a journey (1845) through <a href="../cathen/11415b.htm">Rhenish Prussia</a> (Cologne, <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>), and owing to his vigilance the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> agitation of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Ronge, on the occasion of the exposition of the Holy Coat of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> in 1844, did not affect <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>. Meanwhile the See of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> became <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, moved by the wishes of the <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugians</a> and the needs of that city and district, appointed Mgr. Pecci <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, retaining however the title of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>.



<p>With a very flattering autograph letter from King Leopold, Mgr. Pecci left <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> to spend a month in <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a> and another in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. This brought him in touch with both courts, and afforded him opportunities for meeting many eminent men, among others <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Wiseman</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. Rich in experience and in new <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and with greatly broadened views, he returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 26 May, 1846, where he found the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on his deathbed, so that he was unable to report to him. He made his solemn entry into <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> 27 July, 1846, where he remained for thirty-two years. <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> had intended to make him a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, but his death and the events that troubled the opening years of the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> postponed this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> until 19 December, 1853. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> desired to have him near his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, and repeatedly offered him a <a href="../cathen/14324a.htm">suburbicarian</a> see, but Mgr. Pecci preferred <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, and perhaps was not in accord with <a href="../cathen/01583d.htm">Cardinal Antonelli</a>. It is certainly <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a> that <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> designedly left him in <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, much more <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a> that he did so because Pecci's views were liberalistic and conciliatory. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> he sought chiefly to inculcate <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of Faith. He insisted that his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should preach, and should <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechise</a> not only the young but the grown up; and for this purpose he wished one hour in the afternoon set apart on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and feast days, thus forestalling one of the regulations laid down by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> in 1905 for the whole Church. He brought out a new edition of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> (1856), and for his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> he wrote a practical guide for the exercise of the ministry (1857). He provided frequently for retreats and missions. After the <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmontese</a> occupation and the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders the number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> was greatly diminished; to remedy this lack of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, he established an association of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> missionaries ready to go wherever sent (1875). He sought to create a learned and virtuous <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and for this purpose spent much care on the material, moral, and scientific equipment of his <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>, which he called the apple of his eye. Between 1846 and 1850 he enlarged its buildings at considerable personal sacrifice, secured excellent professors, presided at examinations, and himself gave occasional instruction. He introduced the study of the philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, and in 1872 established an "Accademia di S. Tommaso", which he had planned as far back as 1858.

<p>In 1872 also he introduced the government standards for studies of the secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> and colleges. When the funds of the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> were converted into state bonds, its revenues were seriously affected, and this entailed new <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. With the exception of a few troublesome <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who relied on the protection of the new government, the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was excellent. For the assistance of many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> impoverished by the confiscation of church funds, he instituted in 1873 the Society of S. Gioacchino, and for charitable works generally, conferences of <a href="../cathen/15434c.htm">St. Vincent de Paul</a>. He remodelled many <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> for the young and began others, for the care of which he invited from <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of the Sacred Heart and Brothers of Mercy. During his episcopate thirty-six new churches were built in the diocese. His charity and foresight worked marvels during the famine of 1854, consequent on the earthquake which had laid waste a large part of Umbria. Throughout the political troubles of the period, he was a strong supporter of the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, but he was careful to avoid anything that might give the new government pretext for further annoyances.

<p>Shortly after his arrival in <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> there occurred a popular commotion which his personal intervention succeeded in appeasing. In 1849, when bands of Garibaldians expelled from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were infesting the Umbrian hills, the Austrians under Prince Liechtenstein hastened to occupy <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, but Mgr. Pecci, realizing that this foreign occupation would only increase the irritation of the inhabitants, set out for the Austrian camp and succeeded in saving the town from occupation. In 1859 a few outlaws set up in <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> a provisional government; when the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> heard that, few as they were, they were preparing to resist the pontifical troops advancing under Colonel Schmidt he wrote a generous letter to try and dissuade them from their mad purpose and to avoid a useless shedding of blood. Unfortunately they spurned his advice, and the result was the so-called "Massacre of Perugia" (20 June). In February, 1860, he wrote a pastoral letter on the necessity of the temporal power of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; but on 14 September of that year <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> and Umbria were annexed to <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>. In vain he besought General Fanti not to bombard the town; and during the first years that followed the annexation he wrote, either in his own name or in the name of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Umbria, eighteen protests against the various <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and regulations of the new Government on <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters: against <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">civil marriage</a>, the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and the inhuman cruelty of their oppressors, the "Placet" and <a href="../cathen/05707a.htm">"Exequatur"</a> in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> nominations, military service for <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, and the confiscation of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>. But withal he was so cautious and prudent, in spite of his outspokenness, that he was never in serious difficulties with the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>. Only once was he brought before the courts, and then he was acquitted.

<p>In August, 1877, on the death of Cardinal de Angelis, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> appointed him camerlengo, so that he was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to reside in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pope Pius</a> died 7 February, 1878, and during his closing years the Liberal press had often insinuated that the Italian Government should take a hand in the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> and occupy the Vatican. However the Russo-Turkish War and the sudden death of Victor Emmanuel II (9 January, 1878) distracted the attention of the Government, the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> proceeded as usual, and after the three scrutinies Cardinal Pecci was elected by forty-four votes out of sixty-one

<p>Shortly before this he had written an inspiring pastoral to his flock on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and civilization. Ecclesiastical affairs were in a difficult and tangled state. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, had won for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and veneration of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, and even the admiration of its adversaries. But, though inwardly strengthened, its relations with the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil powers</a> had either ceased or were far from cordial. But the fine diplomatic tact of Leo succeeded in staving off ruptures, in smoothing over difficulties, and in establishing good relations with almost all the powers.

<p>Throughout his entire pontificate he was able to keep on good terms with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and he pledged himself to its Government that he would call on all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to accept the Republic. But in spite of his efforts very few monarchists listened to him, and towards the end of his life he beheld the coming failure of his French policy, though he was spared the pain of witnessing the final catastrophe which not even he could have averted. It was to Leo that <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> owed her alliance with <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>; in this way he offset the Triple Alliance, hoped to ward off impending conflicts, and expected friendly assistance for the solution of the Roman question. With <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> he was more fortunate. On the very day of his election, when notifying the emperor of the event, he expressed the hope of seeing relations with the German Government re-established, and, though the emperor's reply was coldly civil, the ice was broken. Soon Bismarck, unable to govern with the <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a>, to win whose favour he had started the <a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a>, found he needed the <a href="../cathen/16020b.htm">Centre Party</a>, or <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and was willing to come to terms. As early as 1878 negotiations began at Kissingen between Bismarck and Aloisi-Masella, the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a>; they were carried a step farther at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> between the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> Jacobini and Prince von Reuss; soon after this some of the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were relaxed. From about 1883 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> began to be appointed to various sees, and some of the exiled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were allowed to return. By 1884 diplomatic relations were renewed, and in 1887 a <em>modus vivendi</em> between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> was brought about. Bismarck proposed that Pope Leo should arbitrate between <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The good feeling with <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> found expression in the three visits paid Leo by William II (1888, 1893, and 1903), whose father also, when crown prince (1883) had visited the Vatican. As a sort of <em>quid pro quo</em> Bismarck thought the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ought to use his authority to prevent the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from opposing some of his political schemes. Only once did Leo interfere in a parliamentary question, and then his advice was followed. In 1880 relations with the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Government were again broken off &#224; propos of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> question, on the pretext that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was lending himself to duplicity, encouraging the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to resist, and pretending to the Government that he was urging moderation. As a matter of fact, the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> embassy to the Vatican had been settled on before the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> question arose. In 1883 the new <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Government restored it. During Pope Leo's pontificate the condition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> improved somewhat, especially in the Ficino, in Aargau, and in Basle. In <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> Soloviev's attempt on Alexander II (14 April, 1879) and the silver jubilee of that czar's reign (1888) gave the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> an opportunity to attempt a <em>rapprochement</em>. But it was not until after <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> came to the throne (1883) that an agreement was reached, by which a few <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a> were tolerated and some of the more stringent <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> slightly relaxed. But when in 1884, Leo consented to present to the czar a petition from the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> against the oppression they had to suffer, the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> only increased in bitterness. In the last year of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> (May, 1894) diplomatic relations were re-established. On the day of his election, Leo had expressed to this emperor the wish to see diplomatic relations restored; Alexander, like William, though more warmly, answered in a non-committal manner. In the meantime Leo was careful to exhort the Poles under Russian domination to be loyal subjects.

<p>Among the acts of Leo XIII that affected in a particular way the English-speaking world may be mentioned: for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the elevation of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">John Henry Newman</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> (1879), the "Romanos Pontifices" of 1881 concerning the relations of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> (1886) of fifty <a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyrs</a>, the celebration of the thirteenth centenary of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, Apostle of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (1891), the Encyclicals "Ad Anglos" of 1895, on the return to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity, and the "Apostolic&aelig; Cur&aelig;" of 1896, on the non-validity of the <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">Anglican orders</a>. He restored the Scotch <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in 1878, and in 1898 addressed to the Scotch a very touching letter. In English <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> Pope Leo established the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in 1886, and regulated there long-standing conflicts with the Portugese authorities. In 1903 King Edward VII paid him a visit at the Vatican. The <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church experienced his pastoral solicitude on many occasions. His letter to Archbishop McCabe of <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a> (1881), the elevation of the same <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> in 1882, the calling of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1885, the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the Holy Office (13 April, 1888) on the plan of campaign and <a href="../cathen/16012a.htm">boycotting</a>, and the subsequent <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> of 24 June, 1888, to the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> represent in part his fatherly concern for the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> people, however diverse the feelings they aroused at the height of the land agitation.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> at all times attracted the attention and admiration of Pope Leo. He confimed the decrees of the Third <a href="../cathen/02235a.htm">Plenary Council of Baltimore</a> (1884), and raised to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> Archbishop Gibbons of that city (1886). His favourable action (1888), at the instance of Cardinal Gibbons, towards the Knights of Labour won him general approval. In 1889 he sent a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> delegate, <a href="../cathen/13486a.htm">Monsignor Satolli</a>, to represent him at Washington on the occasion of the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/03455a.htm">Catholic University of America</a>. The Apostolic Delegation at Washington was founded in 1892; in the same year appeared his <a href="../library/docs_le13qs.htm">Encyclical on Christopher Columbus</a>. In 1893 he participated in the <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a> Exposition held to commemorate the fourth centenary of the discovery of America; this he did by the loan of valuable <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, and by sending <a href="../cathen/13486a.htm">Monsignor Satolli</a> to represent him. In 1895 he addressed to the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> his memorable <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Longinqua Oceani Spatia"; in 1898 appeared his letter "Testem Benevolenti&aelig;" to Cardinal Gibbons on "Americanism"; and in 1902 his admirable letter to the American <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in response to their congratulations on his pontifical jubilee. In <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> he confirmed the agreement made with the <a href="../cathen/12598a.htm">Province of Quebec</a> (1889) for the settlement of the Jesuit Estates question, and in 1897 sent Monsignor Merry del Val to treat in his name with the Government concerning the obnoxious Manitoba School Law. His name will also long be held in benediction in South America for the First Plenary Council of Latin America held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (1899), and for his noble <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> on the abolition of slavery (1888).

<p>In <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> the Government ceased to support the Goan <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and in 1886 a concordat was drawn up. Concordats with Montenegro (1886) and Colombia (1887) followed. The Sultan of Turkey, the Shah of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, the Emperors of <a href="../cathen/08297a.htm">Japan</a> and of <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> (1885), and the Negus of <a href="../cathen/02032c.htm">Abyssinia</a>, Menelik, sent him royal gifts and received gifts from him in return. His charitable intervention with the negus in favour of the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> at the unlucky battle of Adna (1898) failed owing to the attitude taken by those who ought to have been most grateful. He was not successful in establishing direct diplomatic relations with the Sublime Porte and with <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, owing to the jealousy of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and her fear of losing the protectorate over <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. During the negotiations concerning <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippines</a>, Mr. Taft, later President of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, had an opportunity of admiring the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> great qualities, as he himself declared on a memorable occasion.

<p>With regard to the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>, Leo XIII maintained <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX's</a> attitude of protest, thus confirming the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> he had expressed in his pastoral of 1860. He desired complete independence for the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and consequently its restoration as a real sovereignty. Repeatedly, when distressing incidents took place in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he sent notes to the various governments pointing out the intolerable position in which the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was placed through its subjection to a hostile power. For the same reason he upheld the "Non expedit", or prohibition against <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> taking part in political elections. His <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was that once the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> abstained from voting, the subversive elements in the country would get the upper hand and the Italian Government be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to come to terms with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Events <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> he was mistaken, and the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was abandoned by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>. At one time, however, "officious" negotiations were kept up between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the Italian Government through the agency of Monsignor Carini, Prefect of the Vatican Library and a great friend of Crispi. But it is not known on what lines they were conducted. On Crispi's part there could have been no question of ceding any territory to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, moreover, then irritated against <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> because of the Triple Alliance, and fearing that any <em>rapprochement</em> between the Vatican and the Quirinal would serve to increase her rival's prestige, interfered and forced Leo to break off the aforesaid negotiations by threatening to renew hostilities against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The death of Monsignor Carini shortly after this (25 June, 1895) gave rise to the senseless rumour that he had been poisoned. Pope Leo was no less active concerning the interior life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. To increase the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, he recommended in 1882 the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis, whose rules in 1883 he wisely modified; he instituted the feast of the Holy Family, and desired <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> in its <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to be founded everywhere (1892); many of his encyclicals preach the benefits of the <a href="../cathen/13184b.htm">Rosary</a>; and he favoured greatly devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.

<p>Under Leo the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> made great progress; during his pontificate two hundred and forty-eight episcopal or <a href="../cathen/01694b.htm">archiepiscopal</a> sees were created, and forty-eight vicariates or prefectures Apostolic. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Oriental rites were objects of special attention; he had the good fortune to see the end of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> which arose in 1870 between the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm#catholic">Uniat</a> <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenians</a> and ended in 1879 by the conversion of Mgr. Kupelian and other <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. He founded a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> students (1884), and by dividing the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of S. Atanasio he was able to give the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenians</a> a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of their own; already in 1882 he had reformed the <a href="../cathen/13278a.htm">Ruthenian</a> <a href="../cathen/02324a.htm">Order of St. Basil</a>; for the Chaldeans he founded at <a href="../cathen/10598b.htm">Mossul</a> a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of which the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> have charge. In a memorable encyclical of 1897 he appealed to all the schismatics of the East, inviting them to return to the Universal Church, and laying down rules for governing the relations between the various rites in countries of mixed rites. Even among the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Copts</a> his efforts at reunion made headway.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> found a generous patron in Pope Leo. His <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> <a href="../cathen/01177a.htm">"&#198;terni Patris"</a> (1880) recommended the study of <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic philosophy</a>, especially that of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>, but he did not advise a servile study. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he established the Apollinare College, a higher institute for the Latin, Greek, and Italian classics. At his suggestion a <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> college was founded at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At <a href="../cathen/01448a.htm">Anagni</a> he founded and entrusted to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> for all the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the Roman Campagna, on which are modelled the provincial or "regional" <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> desired by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>. Historical scholars are indebted to him for the opening of the Vatican Archives (1883), on which occasion he published a splendid encyclical on the importance of historical studies, in which he declares that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has nothing to fear from historical <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For the administration of the Vatican Archives and Library he called on eminent scholars (Hergenr&ouml;ther, <a href="../cathen/04719a.htm">Denifle</a>, Ehrle; repeatedly he tried to obtain <a href="../cathen/08284c.htm">Janssen</a>, but the latter declined, as he was eager to finish his "History of the German People"). For the convenience of students of the archives and the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> he established a consulting <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15309a.htm">Vatican Observatory</a> is also one of the glories of Pope Leo XIII. To excite <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> students to rival non-Catholics in the study of the Scriptures, and at the same time to guide their studies, he published the "Providentissimus Deus" (1893), which won the admiration even of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, and in 1902 he appointed a <a href="../cathen/02557a.htm">Biblical Commission</a>. Also, to guard against the dangers of the new style of <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologetics</a> founded on <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kantism</a> and now known as <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernism</a>, he warned in 1899 the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (Encycl. "Au Milieu"), and before that, in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> addressed to Cardinal Gibbons, he pointed out the dangers of certain doctrines to which had been given the name of "Americanism" (22 Jan., 1899). In the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> <a href="../cathen/01644a.htm">"Apostolic&aelig; Cur&aelig;"</a> (1896) he definitively decided against the validity of <a href="../cathen/01491a.htm">Anglican Orders</a>. In several other memorable encyclicals he treated of the most serious questions affecting modern <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. They are models of classical style, clearness of statement, and convincing <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>. The most important are: "Arcanum divin&aelig; sapienti&aelig;" (1880) on <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">Christian marriage</a>; "Diuturnum illud" (1881), and "Immortale Dei" (1885) on <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> as the foundation of political life; "Sapienti&aelig; christian&aelig;" (1890) on the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> citizen; "Libertas" (1888) on the real meaning of liberty; "Humanum genus" (1884) against <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasonry</a> (he also issued other documents bearing on this subject).

<p>Civilization owes much to Leo for his stand on the social question. As early as 1878, in his encyclical on the equality of all men, he attacked the fundamental <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Socialism. The <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Rerum novarum" (18 May, 1891) set forth with profound erudition the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> principles bearing on the relations between capital and labour, and it gave a vigorous impulse to the social movement along <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> lines. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, especially, an intense, well-organized movement began; but gradually dissensions broke out, some leaning too much towards Socialism and giving to the words <a href="../cathen/04708a.htm">"Christian Democracy"</a> a political meaning, while others <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erred</a> by going to the opposite extreme. In 1901 appeared the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Graves de Communi", destined to settle the controverted points. The "Catholic Action" movement in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was recognized, and to the "Opera dei Congressi" was added a second group that took for its watchword economic-social action. Unfortunately this latter did not last long, and <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> had to create a new party which has not yet overcome its internal difficulties.

<p>Under Leo the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders developed wonderfully; new orders were founded, older ones increased, and in a short time made up for the losses occasioned by the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> spoliation they had been subjected to. Along every line of religious and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> activity they have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> no small factor in the awakening and strengthening of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life of the whole country. For their better guidance wise constitutions were issued; reforms were made; orders such as the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> and <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, which in times past had divided off into sections, were once more united; and the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> were given an abbot-primate, who resides at St. Anselm's College, founded in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under the auspices of Pope Leo (1883). Rules were laid down concerning members of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders who became secularized.

<p>In canon law Pope Leo made no radical change, yet no part of it escaped his vigilance, and opportune modifications were made as the needs of the times required. On the whole his pontificate of twenty-five years was certainly, in external success, one of the most brilliant. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> the general peace between nations favoured it. The people were tired of that anticlericalism which had led governments to forget their real purpose, i.e. the well-being of the governed; and, on the other hand, prudent statesmen feared excessive catering to the elements subversive of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Leo himself used every endeavour to avoid friction. His three jubilees (the golden jubilees of his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and of his episcopate, and the silver jubilee of his pontificate) showed how wide was the popular sympathy for him. Moreover, his appearance either at Vatican receptions or in St. Peter's was always a signal for outbursts of enthusiasm. Leo was far from robust in health, but the methodical regularity of his life stood him in good stead. He was a tireless worker, and always exacted more than ordinary effort from those who worked with him. The conditions of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> did not permit him to do much for art, but he renewed the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a>, rebuilt its presbytery, and in the Vatican caused a few halls to be <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a>.
