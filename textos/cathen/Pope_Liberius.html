<h1>Pope Liberius</h1>  

<p>(Reigned 352-66)

<p>Pope Julius died on 12 April, according to the "Liberian Catalogue", and Liberius was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 22 May. As this was not a Sunday, 17 May was probably the day. Of his previous life nothing is known save that he was a Roman <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. An epitaph preserved in a copy by a seventh-century pilgrim is attributed to Liberius by <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, followed by many critics, including Duchesne. The principal points in it are that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> confirmed the Nicene Faith in a council, and died in exile for the Faith, unless we render "a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> by exile". The epitaph is attributed by Funk to <a href="../cathen/09723c.htm">St. Martin I</a>. <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, however, declared that no epigraphist could <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the verses are of the fourth and not the seventh century; still it is not easy to fit the lines to Liberius. The text is in <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Inscr. Christ. Urbis Rom&aelig;", etc., II, 83, 85, and Duchesne, "Lib. Pont.", I, 209. See <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> in "Bull. Archeol. Crist." (1883), 5-62; and Von Funk in "Kirchengesch. Abhandl.", I (Paderborn, 1897), 391; Grisar in "Kirchenlex.", s.v.; Suvio, "Nuovi Studi", etc.

<h2 id="i">First years of pontificate</h2>

<p>By the death of Constans (Jan., 350), Constantius had become master of the whole empire, and was bent on uniting all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in a modified form of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. Liberius, like his predecessor Julius, upheld the acquittal of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> at <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a>, and made the decisions of Nic&aelig;a the test of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. After the final defeat of the usurper Magnentius and his death in 353, Liberius, in accordance with the wishes of a large number of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, sent <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to the emperor in Gaul begging him to hold a council. Constantius was pressuring the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gaul to condemn <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, and assembled a number of them at Arles where he had wintered. The court <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who constantly accompanied the emperor, were the rulers of the council. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> (of whom one was Vincent of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>, who had been one of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a>) were so weak as to consent to renounce the cause of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, on condition that all would condemn <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. The court party accepted the compact, but did not carry out their part; and the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> were forced by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to condemn <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, without gaining any concession for themselves. Liberius, on receiving the news, wrote to <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius of Cordova</a> of his deep grief at the fall of Vincent; he himself desired to die, lest he should incur the imputation of having agreed to <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heterodoxy</a>. Another letter in the same strain was addressed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">St. Eusebius, Bishop of Vercelli</a>, who had formerly been one of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>.

<p>Earlier than this, a letter against <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> signed by many Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had arrived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The emperor sent a special envoy named Montanus to <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, where he arrived 22 May, 353, to inform the patriarch that the emperor was willing to grant him a personal interview; but <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> had never asked for this; he recognized that a trap had been set for him, and did not move. He quitted Alexandria only in the following February, when George, an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, was set up as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in his place, amid disgraceful scenes of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. But <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> had already held a council in his own defence, and a letter in his favour, signed by seventy-five (or eighty) <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, had arrived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at the end of May, 353. Constantius publicly accused the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of preventing peace and of suppressing the letter of the Easterns against <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>. Liberius replied with a dignified and touching letter (Obsecro, tranqullissime imperator), in which he declares that he read the letter of the Easterns to a council at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (probably an anniversary council, 17 May, 353), but, as the letter which arrived from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> was signed by a greater number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, it was impossible to condemn <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>; he himself had never wished to be <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but he had followed his predecessors in all things; he could not make peace with the Easterns, for some of them refused to condemn Arius, and they were in communion with George of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, who accepted the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> whom Alexander had long ago <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. He complains of the <a href="../cathen/01727b.htm">Council of Arles</a>, and begs for the assembling of another council, by means of which the exposition of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to which all had agreed at Nic&aelig;a may be enforced for the future. The letter was carried by <a href="../cathen/09410b.htm">Lucifer, Bishop of Calaris</a> (Cagliari), the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Pancratius, and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Hilary, to the emperor at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> asked <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">St. Eusebius</a> to assist the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> with his influence, and wrote again to thank him for having done so. A council was in fact convened at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and met there about the spring of 355. <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">St. Eusebius</a> was persuaded to be present, and he insisted that all should begin by signing the Nicene <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. The court <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> declined. The military were called in. Constantius ordered the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to take his word for the guilt of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, and condemn him. <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">Eusebius</a> was banished, together with <a href="../cathen/09410b.htm">Lucifer</a> and Dionysius of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. Liberius sent another letter to the emperor; and his envoys, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Eutropius and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Hilary, were also exiled, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> being besides cruelly beaten. The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> Auxentius was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> wrote a letter, generally known as "Quamuis sub imagine", to the exiled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, addressing them as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and expressing his regret that he had not been the first to suffer so as to set an example to others; he asks for their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that he may yet be worthy to share their exile.



<p>That these were not mere words was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, not only by Liberius's noble attitude of protest during the preceding years, but by his subsequent conduct. Constantius was not satisfied by the renewed condemnation of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had lapsed at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> under pressure. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was the only <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superior of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, and he "strove with burning desire", says the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Ammianus, "that the sentence should be confirmed by the higher authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of the eternal city</a>". St. Athanasius assures us that from the beginning the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> did not spare Liberius, for they calculated that, if they could but persuade him, they would soon get hold of all the rest. Constantius sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> his prefect of the bed-chamber, the eunuch Eusebius, a very powerful personage, with a letter and gifts. "Obey the emperor and take this" was in fact his message, says St. Athanasius, who proceeds to give the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> reply at length: He could not decide against <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, who had been acquitted by two general <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, and had been dismissed in peace by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, nor could he condemn the absent; such was not the tradition he had received from his predecessors and from St. Peter; if the emperor desired peace, he must annul what he had decreed against <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> and have a council celebrated without emperor or counts or judges present, so that the Nicene Faith might be preserved; the followers of Arius must be cast out and their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>; the unorthodox must not sit in a synod; the Faith must first be settled, and then only could other matters be treated; let Ursacius and <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a>, the court <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from Pannonia, be disregarded, for they had already once disowned their bad actions, and were no longer worthy of credit.

<p>The eunuch was enraged, and went off with his bribes, which he laid before the confession of St. Peter. Liberius severely rebuked the guardians of the holy place for not having prevented this unheard-of sacrilege. He cast the gifts away, which angered the eunuch yet more, so that he wrote to the emperor that it was no longer a question of simply getting Liberius to condemn <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, for he went so far as formally to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. Constantius was persuaded by his eunuchs to send Palatine officers, notaries, and counts, with letters to the Prefect of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Leontius, ordering that Liberius should be seized either secretly or by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and despatched to the court.

<p>There followed a kind of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Bishops, says St. Athanasius, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> ladies were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to hide, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were not safe, foreigners were expelled, the gates and the port were watched. "The Ethiopian eunuch", continues the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, "when he understood not what he read, believed St. Philip; whereas the eunuchs of Constantius do not believe Peter when he confesses Christ, nor the Father indeed, when He reveals His Son"--an allusion to the declarations of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> that in condemning <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> they spoke with the voice of Peter and repeated his confession, "Thou art [the] Christ, the Son of the living God", which the Father Himself had revealed to the Apostle. Liberius was dragged before the emperor at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. He spoke boldly, bidding Constantius cease fighting against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and declaring his readiness to go at once into exile before his enemies had time to trump up charges against him. Theodoret has preserved the minutes of an interview between "the glorious Liberius" and Contstantius, which were taken down by good people, he says, at the time. Liberius refuses to acknowledge the decision of the Council of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and to renounce <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>; the Mareotic acts against him were <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">false witness</a>, and Ursacius and <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> had confessed as much, and had asked pardon from the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Synod of Sardica</a>. Epictetus, the young intruded <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Centumcell&aelig;, interposes, saying that Liberius only wanted to be able to boast to the Roman senators that he had beaten the emperor in argument. "Who are you", adds Constantius, "to stand up for <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> against the world?" Liberius replies: "Of old there were found but three to resist the mandate of the king." The eunuch Eusebius cried: "You compare the emperor to <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nabuchodonosor</a>." Liberius: "No, but you condemn the innocent." He demands that all shall subscribe the Nicene formula, then the exiles must be restored, and all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> must assemble at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> to give <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> a fair trial on the spot.<blockquote><p><em>Epictus:</em> "But the public conveyances will not be enough to carry so many." <br><em>Liberius:</em> "They will not be needed; the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> are rich enough to send their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as far as the sea." <br><em>Constantius:</em> "General <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> must not be too numerous; you alone hold out against the judgment of the whole world. He has injured all, and me above all; not content with the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of my eldest brother, he set Constans also against me. I should prize a victory over him more than one over Silvanus or Magnentius." <br><em>Liberius:</em> "Do not employ <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, whose hands are meant to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a>, to revenge your own enmity. Have the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> restored and, if they agree with the Nicene Faith, let them consult as to the peace of the world, that an innocent man be not condemned." <br><em>Constantius:</em> "I am willing to send you back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, if you will join the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Make peace, and sign the condemnation." <br><em>Liberius:</em> "I have already bidden farewell at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to the brethren. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are more important than residence in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>."</p></blockquote>

<p>The emperor gave the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> three days for consideration, and then banished him to Beroea in Thrace, sending him five hundred gold pieces for his expenses; but he refused them, saying Constantius needed them to pay his soldiers. The empress sent him the same amount, but he sent it to the emperor, saying: "If he does not need it, let him give it to Auxentius or Epictetus, who want such things." Eusebius the eunuch brought him yet more money: "You have laid waste the Churches of the world", the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> broke out, "and do you bring me <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> as to a condemned man? Go and first become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>."

<h2 id="ii">Exile</h2>

<p>On the departure of Liberius from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> had sworn that they would receive no other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. But soon many of them accepted as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the <a href="../cathen/06030a.htm">Archdeacon Felix</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> Bishop Acacius of C&aelig;sarea had been arranged by Epictetus at the emperor's order. The people of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> ignored the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>. Constantius paid his first visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 1 April, 357, and was able to see for himself the failure of his nominee. He was aware that there was no canonical justification for the exile of Liberius and the intrusion of <a href="../cathen/06030a.htm">Felix</a>; in other cases he had always acted in accordance with the decision of a council. He was also greatly moved by the grandeur of the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>--so Ammianus assures us. He was impressed by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the return of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> boldly addressed to him by the noblest of the Roman ladies, whose husbands had insufficient <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> for the venture. There is no reason to suppose that <a href="../cathen/06030a.htm">Felix</a> was recognized by any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> outside <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, unless by the court party and a few extreme <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, and the uncompromising attitude of Liberius through at least the greater part of his banishment must have done more harm to the cause the emperor had at heart than his constancy had done when left at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in peace. It is not surprising to find that Liberius returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> before the end of 357, and that it was noised abroad that he must have signed the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> and perhaps some <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> Creed. His restoration is placed by some critics in 358, but this is impossible, for St. Athanasius tells us that he endured the rigours of exile for two years, and the "Gesta inter Liberium et Felicem episcopos", which forms the preface to the "Liber Precum" of Faustinus and Marcellinus, tells us that he returned "in the third year". The cause of his return is variously related. Theodoret says that Constantius was moved by the Roman matrons to restore him, but when his letter to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, saying that Liberius and <a href="../cathen/06030a.htm">Felix</a> were to be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> side by side, was read in the circus, the Romans jeered at it, and filled the air with cries of "One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one Christ, one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>". The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> historian Philostorgius also speaks of the Romans having eagerly demanded the return of their <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and so does Rufinus. St. Sulpicius Severus, on the other hand, gives the cause as seditions at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> agrees. <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> is more precise, and declares that the Romans rose against <a href="../cathen/06030a.htm">Felix</a> and drove him out, and that the emperor was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to acquiesce. The reading in <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> "Chronicle" is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. He says that a year after the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> had <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjured</a> themselves they were driven out together with <a href="../cathen/06030a.htm">Felix</a>, until (or because) Liberius had re-entered the city in triumph. If we read "until", we shall understand that after Liberius's return the forsworn <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> returned to their allegiance. If we read "because", with the oldest <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>, it will seem rather that the expulsion of <a href="../cathen/06030a.htm">Felix</a> was subsequent to and consequent on the return of Liberius. St. Prosper seems to have understood Jerome in the latter sense. The preface to the "Liber Precum" mentions two expulsions of <a href="../cathen/06030a.htm">Felix</a>, but does not say that either of them was previous to the return of Liberius.

<p>On the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> Philostorgius related that Liberius was restored only when he had consented to sign the second formula of <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a>, which was drawn up after the summer of 357 by the court <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Germinius, Ursacius, <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a>; it rejected the terms <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousios</a></em> and <em>homoiousios</em>; and was sometimes called the "formula of Hosius", who was forced to accept it in this same year, though St. Hilary is surely wrong in calling him its author. The same story of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> fall is supported by three letters attributed to him in the so-called "Historical Fragments" ("Fragmenta ex Opere Historico" in P.L., X, 678 sqq.) of St. Hilary, but <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> tells us it was a lie, propagated by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> Eudoxius, who had just invaded the See of Antioch. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> seems to have believed it, as in his "Chronicle" he says that Liberius "conquered by the tedium of exile and subscribing to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> wickedness entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in triumph". The preface to the "Liber Precum" also speaks of his yielding to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. St. Athanasius, writing apparently at the end of 357, says: "Liberius, having been exiled, gave in after two years, and, in fear of the death with which he was threatened, signed", i.e. the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> himself (Hist. Ar., xli); and again: "If he did not endure the tribulation to the end yet he remained in his exile for two years knowing the conspiracy against me." St. Hilary, writing at Constantinople in 360, addresses Constantius thus: "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether it was with greater impiety that you exiled him than that you restored him" (Contra Const., II).

<p><a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> tells a story which finds no echo in any other writer. He makes Constantius, after his return from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, summon Liberius to <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> (357), and there the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is forced by the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a> leaders, Basil of <a href="../cathen/01464b.htm">Ancyra</a>, Eustathius, and Eleusius, to condemn the "Homoousion"; he is induced to sign a combination of three formul&aelig;: that of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Council of Antioch of 267 against <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a> (in which <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousios</a></em> was said to have been rejected as Sabellian in tendency), that of the <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmian</a> assembly which condemned Photinus in 351, and the Creed of the Dedication Council of Antioch of 341. These formul&aelig; were not precisely <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, and Liberius is said to have exacted from Ursacius and <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> a confession that the Son is "in all things similar to the Father". Hence <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen's</a> story has been very generally accepted as giving a moderate account of Liberius's fall, admitting it to be a fact, yet explaining why so many writers implicitly deny it. But the date soon after Constantius was at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is impossible, as the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a> only united at the beginning of 358, and their short-lived influence over the emperor began in the middle of that year; hence Duchesne and many others hold (in spite of the clear witness of St. Athanasius) that Liberius returned only in 358. Yet <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> mentions the presence of Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and this suits 357; he says that Eudoxius spread the rumour that Liberius had signed the second <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmian</a> formula, and this suits 357 and not the time of <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a> ascendancy. Further, the formula "in all things like" was not the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a> badge in 358, but was forced upon them in 359, after which they adopted it, declaring that it included their special formula "like in substance". Now <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> is certainly following here the lost compilation of the Macedonian (i.e. <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a>) Sabinus, whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to have been untrustworthy wherever his <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> was concerned. Sabinus seems simply to have had the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> story before him, but regarded it, probably rightly, as an invention of the party of Eudoxius; he thinks the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must have been that, if Liberius signed a <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmian</a> formula, it was the harmless one of 351; if he condemned the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">"Homoousion"</a>, it was only in the sense in which it had been condemned at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; he makes him accept the Dedication Creed (which was that of the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a> and all the moderates of the East), and force upon the court <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arian</a> formula of 359 and after. He adds that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmium</a> wrote to <a href="../cathen/06030a.htm">Felix</a> and to the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, asking that Liberius and <a href="../cathen/06030a.htm">Felix</a> should both be accepted as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. It is quite incredible that men like Basil and his party should have done this.

<h2 id="iii">Later years of Liberius</h2>

<p>At the time of his return, the Romans cannot have known that Liberius had fallen, for <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (who is so fond of telling us of the simplicity of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the delicacy of their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> ears) says he entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as a conquerer. It was clearly not supposed that he had been conquered by Constantius. There is no sign of his ever having admitted that he had fallen. In 359 were held the simultaneous Councils of <a href="../cathen/13689b.htm">Seleucia</a> and <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>. At the latter, where most of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, the pressure and delay, and the underhand machinations of the court party entrapped the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was not there, nor did he send <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>. After the council his disapproval was soon known, and after the death of Constantius at the end of 361 he was able publicly to annul it, and to decide, much as a council under <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> decided, that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had fallen could be restored on condition of their proving the sincerity of their repentance by their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. About 366 he received a deputation of the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a> led by Eustathius; he treated them first as <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> (which he could not have done had he ever joined them), and insisted on their accepting the Nicene formula before he would receive them to communion; he was unaware that many of them were to turn out later to be unsound on the question of the Divinity of the Holy Ghost. We learn also from St. Siricius that, after annulling the <a href="../cathen/13057b.htm">Council of Rimini</a>, Liberius issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> forbidding the re-baptism of those <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, which was being practiced by the Luciferian schismatics.

<h2 id="iv">Forged letters</h2>

<p>In the fragments of St. Hilary are embedded a number of letters of Liberius. Fragment IV contains a letter, "Studens paci", together with a very corrupt comment upon it by St. Hilary. The letter has usually been considered a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> since <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> (2nd ed.), and Duchesne expressed the common view when he said in his "Histoire ancienne de l'&Eacute;glise" (1907) that St. Hilary meant us to understand that it is spurious. But its authenticity was defended by <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a>, and has been recently upheld by Schiktanz and Duchesne (1908), all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers. Hermant (cited by <a href="../cathen/04454a.htm">Coustant</a>), followed by Savio, believed that the letter was inserted by a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a> in the place of a genuine letter, and he took the first words of St. Hilary's comment to be serious and not ironical: "What in this letter does not proceed from <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and from the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?" In this document Liberius is made to address the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the East, and to declare that on receiving an epistle against St. Athanasius from the Oriental <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, which had been sent to his predecessor Julius, he had hesitated to condemn that saint, since his predecessor had absolved him, but he had sent <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to Alexandria to summon him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> had refused to come, and Liberius on receiving new letters from the East had at once <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him, and was now anxious to communicate with the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> party. Duchesne thinks this letter was written in exile at the beginning of 357, and that Liberius had really sent an embassy (in 352-3), suggesting that <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> should come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; now in his exile he remembers that <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> had excused himself, and alleges this as a pretext for condemning him. It seems inconceivable, however, that after heroically supporting <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> for years, and, having suffered exile for more than a year rather than condemn him, Liberius should motive his present weakness by a disobedience on the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> part at which he had testified no resentment during all this stretch of time. On the contrary, St. Hilary's comment seems plainly to imply that the letter was forged by Fortunatian, <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, one of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who condemned <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> and joined the court party at the Council of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> in 355. Fortunatian must have tried to excuse his own fall, by pretending the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (who was then still in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>) had entrusted this letter to him to give to the emperor, "but Potamius and Epictetus did not believe it to be genuine when they condemned the pope with glee (as the Council of Rimini said of them)", else they would not have condemned him to exile, "and Fortunatian sent it also to many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> without getting any gain by it". And St. Hilary goes on to declare that Fortunatian had further condemned himself by omitting to mention how <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> had been acquitted at <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a> after the letter of the Easterns against him to Pope Julius, and how a letter had come from a council at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and all <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> in his favour to Liberius, as earlier to Julius. Hilary appeals to documents which follow, evidently the letter "Obsecro" to the emperor (already mentioned), in which Liberius attests that he received the defence by the Egyptians at the same time with the accusation by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. The letter "Obsecro" forms fragment V, and it seems to have been immediately followed in the original work by fragment VI, which opens with the letter of Liberius to the confessors, "Quamuis sub imagine" (proving how steadfast he was in his support of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>), followed by quotations from letters to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> and to <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius</a>, in which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> deplores the fall of Vincent at Arles. These letters are incontestably genuine.

<p>There follows in the same fragment a paragraph which declares that Liberius, when in exile, reversed all these promises and actions, writing to the wicked, prevaricating <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> the three letters which complete the fragment. These correspond to the authentic letters which have preceded, each to each: the first, "Pro deifico timore" is a parody of "Obsecro"; the second "Quia scio uos", is a reversal of everything said in "Quamuis"; the third "Non doceo", is a palinode, painful to read, of the letter to <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius</a>. The three are clearly forgeries, composed for their present position. They defend the authenticity of "Studens paci", which they represent as having been sent to the emperor from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the hands of Fortunatian; the genuine letters are not contested, but it is shown that Liberius changed his mind and wrote the "Studens paci"; that in spite of this he was exiled, through the machinations of his enemies, so he wrote "Pro deifico timore" to the Easterns, assuring them not only that he had condemned <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> in "Studens paci", but that Demophilus, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02513b.htm">Beroea</a> (reprobated as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> in "Obsecro"), had explained to him the <a href="../cathen/14027b.htm">Sirmian</a> formula of 357, and he had willingly accepted it. This formula disapproved of the words <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousios</a></em> and <em>homoiousios</em> alike; it had been drawn up by Geminius, Ursacius, and <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a>. "Quia scio nos" is addressed precisely to these three court <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and Liberius begs them to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the emperor for his restoration, just as in "Quamuis" he had begged the three confessors to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that he too might be exiled. "Non doceo" parodies the grief of Liberius at the fall of Vincent; it is addressed to Vincent himself and begs him to get the Campanian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to meet and write to the emperor for the restoration of Liberius. Interspersed in the first and second letters are <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a> "to the prevaricator Liberius", attributed by the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a> to St. Hilary. The <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a> is clearly one of the Luciferians, whose <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> consisted in denying all validity to the acts of those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had fallen at the council of <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a> in 359; whereas Pope Liberius had issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> admitting their restoration on their sincere repentance, and also condemned the Luciferian practice of rebaptizing those whom the fallen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.

<p>The aforesaid "Fragments" of St. Hilary have recently been scrutinized by Wilmart, and it appears that they belonged to two different books, the one written in 356 as an apology when the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was sent into exile by the Synod of B&eacute;ziers, and the other written soon after the council of <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a> for the instruction (says Rufinus) of the fallen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; it was entitled "Liber adversus Valentem et Ursacium". The letters of Liberius belonged to the latter work. Rufinus tells us that it was interpolated--he implies this of the whole edition--and that Hilary was accused at a council on the score of these corruptions; he denied them, but, on the book being fetched from his own lodging, they were found in it, and St. Hilary was expelled <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> from the council. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> denied all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the incident, but Rufinus certainly spoke with good evidence, and his story fits in exactly with St. Hilary's own account of a council of ten <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> which sat at his urgent request at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> about 364 to try Auxentius whom he accused of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>. The latter defended himself by equivocal expressions, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> as well as the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Emperor Valentinian were satisfied; St. Hilary, on the contrary, was accused by Auxentius of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and of joining with <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">St. Eusebius of Vercelli</a> in disturbing the peace, and he was banished from the city. He does not mention of what <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> he was accused, nor on what grounds; but it must have been Luciferianism, and Rufinus has informed us of the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> which were offered. It is interesting that the fragments of the book against <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> and Ursacius should still contain in the forged letters of Liberius (and perhaps, also in one attributed to <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">St. Eusebius</a>) a part of the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> evidence on which a <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a> was turned out of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and apparently <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>.

<p>It would seem that when St. Hilary wrote his book "Adversus Constantium" in 360, just before his return from exile in the East, he believed that Liberius had fallen and had renounced St. Athanasius; but his words are not quite clear. At all events, when he wrote his "Adversus Valentem et Ursacium" after his return, he showed the letter "Studens paci" to be a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>, by appending to it some noble letters of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Now this seems to prove that the Luciferians were making use of "Studens paci" after <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, in order to show that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who was now in their opinion too indulgent to the fallen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, had himself been guilty of an even worse betrayal of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause before his exile. In their view, such a fall would unpope him and invalidate all his subsequent acts. That St. Hilary should have taken some trouble to prove that the "Studens paci" was spurious makes it evident that he did not believe Liberius had fallen subsequently in his exile; else his trouble was useless. Consequently, St. Hilary becomes a strong witness to the innocence of Liberius. If St. Athanasius believed in his fall, this was when he was in hiding, and immediately after the supposed event; he was apparently deceived for the moment by the rumours spread by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. The author of the preface to the "Liber Precum" of Faustinus and Marcellinus is an Ursinian masquerading as a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Luciferian in order to get the advantage of the toleration accorded to the latter <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, and he takes a <!--3ref=u44=xxyyyk.htm">Luciferian view of Liberius; possibly he followed Jerome's "Chronicle", which seems to be following the forged letters; for Jerome <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> St. Hilary's book "Against Valens and Ursacius", and he refused to accept the assertion of Rufinus that it had been interpolated. In his account of Fortunatian (De Viris Illust., xcvii) he says this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> "was <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> for having been the first to break the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of Liberius and induce him to give his signature to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and this on his way into exile". This is incredible, for St. Athanasius twice tells us that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> held out two whole years. Evidently <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> (who was very careless about history) had got hold of the story that Fortunatian had a letter of Liberius in his hands after the Council of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, and he concludes that he must have met Liberius as the latter passed through Aquileia on his way to Thrace; that is to say, Jerome has read the forged letters and has not quite understood them.

<p>Rufinus, who was himself of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, says he could not find out whether Liberius fell or not. This seems to be as much as to say that, knowing necessarily the assertions of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, he was unable to discover on what they were based. He himself was not deceived by the forgeries, and there was indeed no other basis.

<p>Positive evidence in favour of Liberius is not wanting. About 432 St. Prosper re-edited and continued <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> "Chronicle", but he was careful to omit the words <em>t&aelig;dio victus exilii</em> in relating the return of Liberius. St. Sulpicius Severus (403) says Liberius was restored <em>ob seditiones Romanas</em>. A letter of Pope St. Anastasius I (401) mentions him with Dionysius, Hilary, and <a href="../cathen/05614b.htm">Eusebius</a> as one of those who would have died rather than <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> Christ with the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> remembered him as an exceedingly holy man. <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> has placed the exile of Liberius after the Council of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, through too carelessly following the order of Rufinus; unlike Rufinus, however, he is not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> about the fall of Liberius, but gives as sufficient reason for his return the revolt of the Romans against <a href="../cathen/06030a.htm">Felix</a>, and he has expressly omitted the story which <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> took from Sabinus, a writer of whose <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> <a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a> had a low opinion. To Theodoret Liberius is a glorious athlete of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; he tells us more of him than any other writer has done, and he tells it with enthusiasm.

<p>But the strongest arguments for the innocence of Liberius are a priori. Had he really given in to the emperor during his exile, the emperor would have published his victory far and wide; there would have been no possible <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about it; it would have been more <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> than even that gained over <a href="../cathen/07475a.htm">Hosius</a>. But if he was released because the Romans demanded him back, because his deposition had been too uncanonical, because his resistance was too heroic, and because <a href="../cathen/06030a.htm">Felix</a> was not generally recognized as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, then we might be sure he would be suspected of having given some pledge to the emperor; the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and the Felicians alike, and soon the Luciferians, would have no difficulty in spreading a report of his fall and in winning credence for it. It is hard to see how Hilary in banishment and <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> in hiding could disbelieve such a story, when they heard that Liberius had returned, though the other exiled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were still unrelieved.

<p>Further, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> after <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, that the fallen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> could not be restored unless they showed their sincerity by vigour against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, would have been laughable, if he himself had fallen yet earlier, and had not publicly atoned for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Yet, we can be quite certain that he made no public confession of having fallen, no recantation, no atonement.

<p>The forged letters and, still more, the strong words of <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> have perpetuated the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in his guilt. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> makes him return from exile to persecute the followers of <a href="../cathen/06030a.htm">Felix</a>, who becomes a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and a saint. <a href="../cathen/05615a.htm">St. Eusebius, martyr</a>, is represented in his Acts as a Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianizing</a> Liberius. But the curious "Gesta Liberii", apparently of the time of Pope Symmachus, do not make any clear allusion to a fall. The Hieronymian Martyrology gives his deposition both on 23 Sept. and 17 May; on the former date he is commemorated by Wandalbert and by some of the enlarged <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of Usuard. But he is not in the Roman Martyrology.

<h2 id="v">Modern judgments on Pope Liberius</h2>

<p>Historians and critics have been much divided as to the guilt of Liberius. Stilting and Zaccaria are the best known among the earlier defenders; in the nineteenth century, Palma, Reinerding, <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, <a href="../cathen/08566b.htm">Jungmann</a>, Grisar, Feis, and recently Savio. These have been inclined to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the authenticity of the testimonies of St. Athanasius and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> to the fall of Liberius, but their arguments, though serious, hardly amount to a real probability against these texts. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and Gallican writers have been severe on Liberius (e.g. Moeller, Barmby, the Old-Catholic Langen, and <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>), but they have not pretended to decide with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> what <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> formula he signed. With these Renouf may be grouped, and lately Schiktanz. A more moderate view is represented by Hefele, who denied the authenticity of the letters, but admitted the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen's</a> story, looking upon the union of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a> as a deplorable mistake, but not a lapse into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. He is followed by Funk and Duchesne (1907), while the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Kr&uuml;ger is altogether undecided. The newest view, brilliantly exposed by Duchesne in 1908, is that Liberius early in 357 (because the preface to the "Liber Precum" makes Constantius speak at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in April-May as though Liberius had already fallen) wrote the letter "Studens paci", and, finding it did not satisfy the emperor, signed the indefinite and insufficient formula of 351, and wrote the three other contested letters; the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> leaders were still not satisfied, and Liberius was only restored to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> when the <a href="../cathen/13693b.htm">Semi-Arians</a> were able to influence the emperor in 358, after Liberius had agreed with them as <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> relates. The weak points of this theory are as follows: There is no other authority for a fall so early as the beginning of 357 but a casual word in the document referred to above; the "Studens paci" is senseless at so late a date; the letter "Pro deifico timore" plainly means that Liberius had accepted the formula of 357 (not that of 351), and had he done so, he would certainly have been restored at once; the story of <a href="../cathen/14165c.htm">Sozomen</a> is untrustworthy, and Liberius must have returned in 357.

<p>It should be carefully noted that the question of the fall of Liberius is one that has been and can be freely debated among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. No one pretends that, if Liberius signed the most <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> formul&aelig; in exile, he did it freely; so that no question of his <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibility</a> is involved. It is admitted on all sides that his noble attitude of resistance before his exile and during his exile was not belied by any act of his after his return, that he was in no way sullied when so many failed at the <a href="../cathen/13057b.htm">Council of Rimini</a>, and that he acted vigorously for the healing of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> throughout the West from the grievous wound. If he really consorted with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, condemned <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, or even denied the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, it was a momentary human weakness which no more compromises the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> than does that of St. Peter.

<p>The letters of Liberius, together with his sermon on the occasion of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of St. Ambrose's sister to virginity (preserved by that Father, "De Virg.", i, ii, iii), and the dialogue with the emperor (<a href="../cathen/14574b.htm">Theodoret</a>, <a href="../fathers/27022.htm"><em>Church History</em> II.16</a>) are collected in <a href="../cathen/04454a.htm">Coustant</a> "Epistol&aelig; Rom. Pont." (reprint in P.L. VIII). A critical edition from <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> of the three spurious epistles of St. Hilary, 'Frag.' VI, in "Revue B&eacute;n&eacute;d." (Jan., 1910).
