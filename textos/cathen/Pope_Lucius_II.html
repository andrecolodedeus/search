<h1>Pope Lucius II</h1>  

<p>(Gherardo Caccianemici dal Orso)

<p>Born at Bologna, unknown <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>, died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 15 February, 1145. Before entering the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a> he was a canon regular in Bologna. In 1124 Honorius II created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme. From 1125-1126 he was <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> where he took part in the election of King Lothair III in 1125, was instrumental in the appointment of St. Norbert as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> in July, 1126, and helped settle the quarrel concerning the filling of the See of Wurzburg, after Bishop Gebhard had been deposed by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority in 1126. During the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> (1130-43) we find him three times as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, viz., in the years 1130-1, 1133-4, and 1136. In all these legations he loyally supported the interests of <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a>, and it must be ascribed chiefly to his exertions that Lothair III made two expeditions to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> for the purpose of protecting <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="../cathen/01447a.htm">Anacletus II</a>. Towards the end of the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> he was appointed <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancellor and librarian. He was elected and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 12 March, 1144, to succeed <a href="../cathen/03478a.htm">Celestine II</a> who had reigned only five months and twelve days.

<p>The new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> took the name of Lucius II; shortly after his accession he had a conference with King Roger of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> at Ceperano early in June, 1144, for the purpose of reaching an understanding with the king regarding his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as a vassal of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. Roger's demands, however, were so extravagant that Lucius on the advice of his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> rejected them. The king now had recourse to arms and Lucius was forced to conclude a truce on terms that were dictated by Roger. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> affairs were even less promising. Lucius, indeed, had succeeded in dissolving the senate which had been reluctantly established by <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> and which had practically wrested the temporal power from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but encouraged by the success of King Roger of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, the republican faction now elected Pierleoni, a brother of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> Anacletus, as senator and demanded that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should relinquish all temporal matters into his hands. After vainly calling upon Emperor Conrad for protection, Lucius II marched upon the Capitol at the head of a small army but suffered defeat. If we may believe the statement of <a href="../cathen/06626b.htm">Godfrey of Viterbo</a> in his "Pantheon" (Muratori, "Script. rer. Ital.", VII, 461; and P.L., CXCVIII, 988) Lucius II was severely injured by stones that were thrown upon him on this occasion and died a few days later. At a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> during May, 1144, he settled the prolonged dispute between the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dol by making the latter suffragan of the former. He requested Abbot Peter of Cluny to send thirteen of his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and upon their arrival gave them the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Sabas on the Aventine on 19 January, 1145. He founded a few other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and was especially well disposed towards the recently instituted Order of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensians</a>. His epistles and privileges are printed in P.L., CLXXIX, 823-936.
