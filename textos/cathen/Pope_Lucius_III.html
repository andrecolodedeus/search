<h1>Pope Lucius III</h1>  

<p>(Ubaldo Allucingoli)

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a>, unknown <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>; died at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, 25 Notaember, 1185. <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of Santa Prassede on 23 February, 1141, and afterwards sent him as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Under <a href="../cathen/05599a.htm">Eugene III</a> he was sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and on 1 January, 1159, he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia and Velletri</a>. In 1177 he was commissioned by <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> to take part in the famous peace congress of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, where an amicable settlement was reached between <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> and <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Emperor Frederick I</a>. Hereupon he was appointed a member of the court of arbitration which was instituted to investigate the validity of the donation of Countess Matilda, but which arrived at no definite conclusion. On 1 September, 1181, a day after the death of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, he was elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Velletri</a> where he was also <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> on the following Sunday, 6 September. In the beginning of November he came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but there the revolutionary party soon became so incensed against him because he refused to grant them certain privileges which his predecessors had granted, that he was compelled to leave <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the middle of March, 1182. He went to <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Velletri</a> where he received the ambassadors whom King William of <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> had sent to obtain <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> from the ban which he had incurred under <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>. He freed the king from all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> censures and as a sign of good will sent him the <a href="../cathen/06629a.htm">Golden Rose</a> on 17 March, 1183. From <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Velletri</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> proceeded to Segni where on 5 September, 1183, he <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>, who had been <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that place. He again returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> endeavouring to put an end to the continual intestine dissensions of the Romans, but they made life so unbearable to him that he left the city a second time.

<p>After spending a short time in Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> Lucius III went to Bologna where he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> on 8 July, 1184. The remainder of his pontificate he spent at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, where, with the cooperation of <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Emperor Frederick I</a>, he convened a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> from October to November, 1184, at which severe measures were taken against the prevalent <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of those days, especially against the <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Cathari</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldenses</a>, and the Arnoldists. At this synod the emperor promised to make preparations for a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> to the Holy Land. Though the relations between Lucius III and <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Emperor Frederick I</a> were not openly hostile, still they were always strained. When after the death of Bishop Arnold of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> a double election ensued, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> firmly refused to give his <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> to Volkmar, the candidate of the minority, although the emperor had already invested him at <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>. Neither did Lucius III yield to the emperor who demanded that the German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, unlawfully appointed by the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipopes</a> during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, should be reconsecrated and retain their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. He also refused to grant Frederick's request to crown his son Henry IV emperor. On the other hand, Frederick would not acknowledge the validity of the Matildan donations to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and did not assist Lucius against the Roman barons. The letters and decrees of Lucius III are printed in P.L., CCI, 1071-1376.
