<h1>Pope Marcellus II</h1>  

<p>(MARCELLO CERVINI DEGLI SPANNOCHI)

<p>Born 6 May, 1501, at <a href="../cathen/10531a.htm">Montepulciano</a> in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>; died 6 May, 1555, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His father, Ricardo Cervini, was Apostolic treasurer in the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>. After studying some time at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, he came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, shortly after the accession of <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>, in 1523, to continue his studies, and through his purity of life and longing for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> gained the respect and friendship of many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of high influence. <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a>, who had succeeded <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a> in 1534, appointed him prothonotary apostolic and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> secretary. When, in 1538, <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> entrusted his youthful nephew, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, with practically the complete management of the temporal affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the prudent and virtuous Cervini was appointed the adviser and private secretary of the young and inexperienced <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and as such had a great influence in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> curia. He accompanied Farnese on his various legations, and in order that he might take actual part in the consultations and negotiations between Farnese and the monarchs of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> he was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a> of the title of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, 19 December, 1539. He had already been appointed to the See of <a href="../cathen/11047a.htm">Nicastro</a>, in addition to which he became administrator of the Diocese of Reggio the following year and that of <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a> in 1544. In 1539 he accompanied Farnese on an important legation to <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V of Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I of France</a>. The purpose of this legation was to induce the two monarchs to send the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of their countries to the intended General Council of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to gain their assistance against <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII of England</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>.

<p>They had an audience with <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> at <a href="../cathen/01429d.htm">Amiens</a> on 9 February, 1540, and with the emperor at <a href="../cathen/06542c.htm">Ghent</a> on the twenty-fourth of the same month, but their mission <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> useless. They were already returning to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> when Cervini received orders from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to stay as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> at the imperial court and to represent him at the Diet which the emperor wished to convene at <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>. When, however, it became evident that the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> would be predominant at the Diet and had no desire to come to an understanding with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> counteracted his order and sent no representative to the Diet which in the meantime had been transferred to Hagenau. In October, 1540, Cervini returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, not, however, before he had urgently requested the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to send a representative to the intended Diet of Worms. In a consistory held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 6 February, 1545, he was appointed one of the three presidents of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. His two colleagues were Cardinals Giovanni Maria del Monte (afterwards <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a>) and <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Reginald Pole</a>. On 13 March, 1545, he arrived at <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>. During the first period of the Council, i.e. from its opening session on 13 December, 1545, until its prorogation for an indefinite period at Bologna on 14 September, 1547, he fearlessly represented the interests of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against all opposition from the emperor, whose extreme <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> he in consequence incurred. In 1548 he succeeded <a href="../cathen/14292b.htm">Agostino Steuco</a> as librarian of the Vatican with the title of "Bibliothec&aelig; Apostolic&aelig; Vatican&aelig; Protector". Under his protectorate the Vatican <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was soon put in a flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. More than 500 Latin, Greek and Hebrew volumes were added, and new catalogues of the Greek and Latin <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> were prepared. As early as 1539 he had induced the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to have printed at least the most valuable Greek <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. Cervini's public activity was less prominent during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a> (1550-5). He was replaced as president of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> by Marcello Crescenzi in the hope that the emperor would give his support to the presidents of the Council.

<p>After the death of <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a> (23 March, 1555), the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> present in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 3 in number, entered the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> on 4 April, and four days later Cardinal Marcello Cervini was elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, although the emperor had instructed his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to prevent his election. Contrary to custom, Cervini, like <a href="../cathen/01159b.htm">Adrian VI</a>, retained his old name of Marcello and was called Marcellus II. On the following day, 10 April, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, for, though he had administered the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/11047a.htm">Nicastro</a>, <a href="../cathen/12717a.htm">Reggio</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07055a.htm">Gubbio</a>, he had not yet received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on the same day, but without the customary solemnity, on account of the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten season</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had been one of those <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who were desirous of an inner reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. While administrator of <a href="../cathen/12717a.htm">Reggio</a> he undertook a thorough visitation of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in 1543, and abolished abuses wherever they were found. Immediately upon his accession he took the work of reform in hand; he died after a reign of only 22 days, of a sickness resulting from overexertion during the pontifical functions of <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a> and <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. <a href="../cathen/11421b.htm">Palestrina</a> entitled one of his famous polyphonic masses "Missa Pap&aelig; Marcelli" in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. This mass was not, however, as is often asserted, chanted in the presence of Marcellus II; it was not composed until after the death of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.
