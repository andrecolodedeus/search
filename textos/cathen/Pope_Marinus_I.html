<h1>Pope Marinus I</h1>  

<p>(882-884)</p>

<p>There is reason for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that Marinus I was elected on the very day of the death of <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a> (16 Dec., 882), and that he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> without waiting for the consent of the incompetent emperor, Charles the Fat. If the actual date of his election is uncertain, that of his death is still more so; but it was perhaps 15 May 884. In the seventh century there was a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, St. Martinus I, and, owing to the similarity between the names Martinus and Marinus, some chroniclers called Pope Marinus <em>Martinus</em>. Hence, some modern historians have <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> described the two <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> Marinus as Martinus II and Martinus III respectively, and the successor of <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> called himself Martinus IV. Marinus, about whom but little is known, had a distinguished career before he became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He was the son of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Palumbo, was born at Gallese, and was attached to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> at the age of twelve. <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> him sub-deacon, and, after he had been made a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, he was sent on three important embassies to Constantinople. The second time he went there (869) to preside, as one of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> of <a href="../cathen/01156a.htm">Adrian II</a>, over the <a href="../cathen/04310b.htm">Eighth General Council</a>. <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a>, who made him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of C&aelig;re (Cervetri), treasurer (<em>arcarius</em>) of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, despatched him on that mission to Constantinople, which resulted in his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> for his firmness in carrying out his instructions. Although a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he was elected to succeed <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a>, whose policy he partly abandoned and partly followed. In the hope of lessening the factions in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he, most unfortunately as the sequel <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, reversed the action of his predecessor regarding Bishop Formosus of Porte, whom he absolved from all censures, and permitted to return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. But Marinus vigourously upheld the policy of <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">John VIII</a> with regard to Photius, whom he himself condemned. Trusting to get support from Charles the Fat, he met that useless emperor in 833. But, unable to help himself, Charles could do nothing for others. Marinus sent the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> to the distinguished Fulk of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>, and, at the request of <a href="../cathen/01309d.htm">King Alfred of England</a>, freed from all taxes the <em>Schola Anglorum</em>, or headquarters of the English in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Marinus was buried in the portico of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>.
