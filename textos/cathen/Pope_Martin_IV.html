<h1>Pope Martin IV</h1>  

<p>(Simon de Brie).

<p>Born at the castle of Montpensier in the old French province of Touraine at an unknown <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>; d. at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> 28 March, 1285. As <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> he held a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefice</a> at <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> for a short time, whereupon he became canon and treasurer at the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Martin in <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>. <a href="../cathen/09368a.htm">King Louis IX</a> made him Chancellor of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1260 and <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a> with the titular <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Cecilia in December, 1262. Under <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> (1261-4) and his successor, <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a> (1265-8), he was <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> with powers to offer the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Kingdom of Sicily</a> to Charles of Anjou on certain conditions. Under <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> (1271-76) he was sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> a second time, with ample faculties to stem the abuses that had crept into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In this capacity he presided over various reformatory <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, the most important of which was the one held at <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a> in September, 1276 (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Sacr. Conc. nova at ampl. Collectio XXIV, 165-180). Just six months after the death of <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Pope Nicholas III</a>, Simon de Brie was unanimously elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> on 22 February, 1281. His election was due to Charles of Anjou who was present at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> and caused the two most influential <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of the Italian faction to be <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> before the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, on the plea that they were retarding the election. Cardinal Simon de Brie accepted the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a> with reluctance and chose the name of Martin. Though he was only the second <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by the name of Martin he is generally known as Martin IV, because since the beginning of the thirteenth century the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Popes</a> <a href="../cathen/09670b.htm">Marinus I</a> (882-4) and <a href="../cathen/09670c.htm">Marinus II</a> (941-6) were listed among the Martins.

<p>Unable to go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of French nationality was <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, and unwilling to stay at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a> which was under <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> because it had <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> two <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, Martin IV went to <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a> where he was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> on 23 March. Though personally <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and well-meaning, the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was dependent in everything on Charles of Anjou whom he at once appointed to the influential position of Roman Senator. He also assisted him in his endeavours to restore the Latin Empire of the East, and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> the Greek emperor, Michael Palaeologus, of Constantinople, who opposed the plans of Charles of Anjou. By this imprudent act he broke the union which had been effected between the Greek and the Latin Churches at the Council of Lyons in 1274. After <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> forcibly threw off the galling yoke of Charles of Anjou and gave expression to its deep <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the cruel massacre known as the <a href="../cathen/15384a.htm">Sicilian Vespers</a>, Pope Martin IV used his full <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> power to save <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. He <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Peter III of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> whom the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilians</a> had elected as their king, declared his kingdom of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> forfeited and ordered a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> to be preached against him. But all his efforts <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> useless. Among the seven <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> created by Martin IV was Benedetto Gaetano, who afterwards ascended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne as the famous <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>.
