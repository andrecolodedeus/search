<h1>Pope Martin V</h1>  

<p>(Oddone Colonna)

<p>Born at Genazzano in the Campagna di Roma, 1368; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 20 Feb., 1431. He studied at the <a href="../cathen/11737a.htm">University of Perugia</a>, became prothonotary Apostolic under <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> auditor and <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> at various Italian courts under <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a>, and was administrator of the <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Diocese of Palestrina</a> from 15 December 1401, to 1405, and from 18 to 23 September, 1412. On 12 June, 1402 he was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">Cardinal Deacon</a> of San Giorgio in Velabro. He deserted the lawful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/07001a.htm">Gregory XII</a>, was present at the council of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, and took part in the election of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipopes</a> <a href="../cathen/01288a.htm">Alexander V</a> and <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> he was, after a <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of three days, unanimously elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on on 11 November, 1417 by the representatives of the five nations (Germany, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>) and took the name Martin V in honor of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> whose feast fell on the day of his election. Being then only <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> on 12, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> on 13, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on 14 November. On 21 November he was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the great court of the episcopal palace of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>. (Concerning his further activity at the council see <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">COUNCIL OF CONSTANCE</a>.)

<p>The influential <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Colonnas had already given twenty-seven <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to the church, but Martin V was the first to ascend the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne. He was in the full vigor of life being only forty-one years of age. Of simple and unassuming manners and stainless character, he possessed a great <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of canon law, was pledged to no party, and had numerous other good qualities. He seemed the right man to rule the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which had passed through the most critical period in its history &mdash; the so called <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Western Schism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipopes</a>, <a href="../cathen/08434a.htm">John XXIII</a> and <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a> were still recalcitrant. The former, however, submitted to Martin at Florence on 23 June, 1419, and was made Dean of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">Cardinal-Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06243a.htm">Frascati</a>. The latter remained stubborn to the end, but had little following. His successor <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a> submitted to Martin V in 1429, while another successor to <a href="../cathen/09431c.htm">Benedict XIII</a>, who had been elected by only one <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> and styled himself <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by Martin V, and thereafter had only a few supporters (see <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">WESTERN SCHISM</a>). On 22 April, 1418 Martin V dissolved the council but remained in <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>, concluding separate <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordats</a> with <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Sacrorun Conc. Nova et ampl. Coll" XXVII, 1189-93), <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (ibid., 1184-9) <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> (ibid., 1193-5), <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> (Colecci&#243;n completa de concordatos espa&#241;oles", <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, 1862, 9 sq.). A separate concordat was probably made also with <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, though some believe it identical with the concordat with <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. King Sigismund of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> used every effort to induce Martin V to reside in a German city while <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> begged him to come to <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, but, rejecting all offers he set out for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 16 May, 1418.

<p>The sad state of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, however, made it impossible at that time to re-establish the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne there. The city was wellnigh in ruins, famine and sickness had decimated its inhabitants, and the few people that still lived there were on the verge of starvation. Martin V therefore, proceeded slowly on his way thither, stopping for some time at <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>, <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a> and Florence. While sojourning in the two last-named cities, he gained the support of Queen Joanna of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, who was in possession of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, by consenting to recognize her as Queen of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and to permit her <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> by Cardinal Legate Morosini on 28 October, 1419. She ordered her general Sforza Attendolo, to evacuate <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 6 March, 1419 and granted important fiefs in her kingdom to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> two brothers, Giordano and Lorenzo. With the help of the Florentines, Martin also came to an understanding with the famous condottiere Bracco di Montone, who had gained mastery over half of central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> allowed him to retain <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, <a href="../cathen/14754a.htm">Todi</a> and Jesi as vicar of the church, whereupon Bracci restored all his other conquests, and in July 1420, compelled Bologna to submit to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>Martin was now able to continue on his journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he arrived on 28 September, 1420. He at once set to work, establishing order and restoring the dilapidated churches, palaces, bridges, and other public structures. For this reconstruction he engaged some famous masters of the <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, and thus laid the foundation for the Roman <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. When practically a new <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had risen from the ruins of the old, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> turned his attention to the rest of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, which during the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> had become an incoherent mass of independent cities and provinces. After the death of Braccio di Montone in June 1424, <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, <a href="../cathen/14754a.htm">Todi</a> and Jesi freely submitted to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> territory. Bologna again revolted in 1428, but returned to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> allegiance in the following year. In these activities, Martin V was greatly assisted by his kindred, the Colonna <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, whom he overwhelmed with important civil and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> offices. In his case, however, the charge of nepotism loses some of its odiousness, for, when, he came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he was a landless ruler and could look for support to no one except his relatives.

<p>The tendency which some of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> had manifested at the <a href="../cathen/04288a.htm">Council of Constance</a> to substitute constitutional for monarchial government in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to make the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> subject to a General Council, was firmly and successfully opposed by Martin V. The council had decided that a new council should be convened every five years. Accordingly, Martin convened a council, which opened at Pavia in April 1423, but had to be transferred to <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> in June in consequence of the plague. He used the small attendance and the disagreement of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> as a pretext to dissolve it again on 26 February, 1424, but agreed to summon a new council in Basel within seven years. He died, however, before this convened, though he had previously appointed Cardinal Giuliano Cesarini as president of the council with powers to transfer and, if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> suspend it. Though Martin V allowed adjustment of the temporal affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to draw his attention from the more important <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of reforming the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, still the sorry condition of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a> at his accession palliate this neglect. He did not entirely overlook the inner reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; especially during the early part of his pontificate, he made some attempts at reforming the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> at St. Peter's and abolishing the most crying abuses of the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a>. In a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> issued on 16, March 1425, he made some excellent provisions for a thorough reform but the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> apparently remained a dead letter. (This <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> is printed in <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a>, "Beitr&#228;ge sur politischen kirchlichen and Kulturgeschichte der sechs lletxten Jahrhunderte",II, Raisbon,1863, pp335-44.) He also opposed the secular encroachments upon the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by issuing a Constitution (13 April 142), which greatly limited the Gallican liberties in that part of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> which was subject to King Henry VI of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and by entering a new concordat with King Charles VII of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in August, 1426 (see Valois,"Concordats ant&eacute;rieurs a celui de Fran&ccedil;ois I, Pontificat de Martin V" in "Revue des questions historiques", LXXVII, Paris, 1905, pp.376-427). Against the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> in <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> he ordered a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, and negotiated with Constantinople in behalf of a reunion of the Greek with the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a>. His bulls, diplomas, letters, etc. are printed in Mansai, "Sacrorum Conc. Et amp., Coll., " XXVII-XXVIII.
