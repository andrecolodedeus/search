<h1>Pope Nicholas II</h1>  

<p>(GERHARD OF BURGUNDY)

<p>Nicholas was born at Chevron, in what is now <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>; elected at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, December, 1058; died at Florence 19 or 27 July, 1061. Like his predecessor, <a href="../cathen/14290c.htm">Stephen X</a>, he was canon at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>. In 1046 he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, where he restored the canonical life among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of numerous churches. As soon as the news of the death of <a href="../cathen/14290c.htm">Stephen X</a> at Florence reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (4 April, 1058). the Tusculan party appointed a successor in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of John Mincius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Velletri</a>, under the name of <a href="../cathen/02429b.htm">Benedict X</a>. His elevation, due to <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and corruption, was contrary to the specific orders of <a href="../cathen/14290c.htm">Stephen X</a> that, at his death, no choice of a successor was to be made until <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand's</a> return from <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Several <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> protested against the irregular proceedings, but they were compelled to flee from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a> was returning from his mission when the news of these events reached him. He interrupted his journey at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and after agreeing with Duke Godfrey of Lorraine-Tuscany upon Bishop Gerhard for elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, he won over part of the Roman population to the support of his candidate. An embassy dispatched to the imperial court secured the confirmation of the choice by the Empress Agnes. At <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand's</a> invitation, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> met in December, 1058, at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> and elected Gerhard who assumed the name of Nicholas II. On his way to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> held at Sutri a well-attended synod at which, in the presence of Duke Godfrey and the imperial chancellor, Guibert of <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, he pronounced deposition against <a href="../cathen/02429b.htm">Benedict X</a>. The latter was driven from the city in January, 1059, and the solemn <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Nicholas took place on the twenty-fourth of the same month. A cultured and stainless man, the new pontiff had about him capable advisers, but to meet the danger still threatening from <a href="../cathen/02429b.htm">Benedict X</a> and his armed supporters, Nicholas empowered <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a> to enter into negotiations with the Normans of southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal envoy</a> recognized Count Richard of <a href="../cathen/02151a.htm">Aversa</a> as Prince of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a> and received in return Norman troops which enabled the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> to carry on hostilities against Benedict in the Campagna. This campaign did not result in the decisive overthrow of the opposition party, but it enabled Nicholas to undertake in the early part of 1059 a pastoral visitation to <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, <a href="../cathen/05785d.htm">Farfa</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11338a.htm">Osimo</a>. During this journey he raised Abbot Desiderius of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a> and appointed him <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to Campania, <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, Apulia, and Calabria. Early in his pontificate he had sent <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damiani</a> and <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Bishop Anselm of Lucca</a> as his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, where a married and <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> had recently given rise to a reform-party known as the "Pataria". A synod for the restoration of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> was held under the presidency of these envoys who, in spite of a tumultuous uprising which endangered their lives, succeeded in obtaining from Archbishop Guido and the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> a solemn repudiation of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a>.

<p>One of the most pressing needs of the time was the reform of papal elections. It was right that they should be freed from the nefarious influence of the Roman factions and the secular control of the emperor, hitherto less disastrous but always objectionable. To this end Nicholas II held in the Lateran at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 1059 a synod attended by one hundred and thirteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and famous for its law concerning papal elections. Efforts to determine the authentic text of this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> caused considerable controversy in the nineteenth century. That the discussions did not result in a consensus of opinion on the matter need not surprise, if it be remembered that thirty years after the publication of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> complaints were heard regarding the divergency in the text. We possess today a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> and an imperial recension and the sense of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> may be stated substantially as follows: &mdash; <ul><li>(1) At the death of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#b">cardinal-bishops</a> are to confer among themselves concerning a candidate, and, after they have agreed upon a name, they and the other <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> are to proceed to the election. The remainder of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> enjoy the right of acclaiming their choice. <li>(2) A member of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> is to be chosen, except that where a qualified candidate cannot be found in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, an ecclesiastic from another diocese may be elected. <li>(3) The election is to be held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, except that when a free choice is impossible there, it may take place elsewhere. <li>(4) If <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> or other circumstances prevent the solemn <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthronization</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in St. Peter's Chair, he shall nevertheless enjoy the exercise of full Apostolic authority. <li>(5) Due regard is to be had for the right of confirmation or recognition conceded to King Henry, and the same deference is to be shown to his successors, who have been granted personally a like privilege.</ul>

<p>These stipulations constituted indeed a new law, but they were also intended as an implicit <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the procedure followed at the election of Nicholas II. As to the imperial right of confirmation, it became a mere personal privilege granted by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>. The same synod prohibited <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> ordinations, lay investiture, and assistance at the Mass of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> living in <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a>. The rules governing the life of canons and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> which were published at the diet of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aix-la-Chapelle</a> (817) were abolished, because they allowed private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and such abundant food that, as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> indignantly exclaimed, they were adapted to sailors and intemperate matrons rather than to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius of Tours</a>, whose views opposed to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Christ's real presence in the Eucharist</a>, had repeatedly been condemned, also appeared at the Council and was compelled to sign a formula of <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a>.

<p>At the end of June, 1059, Nicholas proceeded to <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> and thence to Melfi, the capital of Norman Apulia, where he held an important synod and concluded the famous alliance with the Normans (July-August, 1059). Duke <a href="../cathen/07072b.htm">Robert Guiscard</a> was invested with the sovereignty of Apulia, Calabria, and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> in case he should reconquer it from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>; he bound himself, in return, to pay an annual tribute, to hold his lands as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> vassal, and to protect the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>, its possessions, and the freedom of papal elections. A similar agreement was concluded with Prince Richard of <a href="../cathen/03319a.htm">Capua</a>. After holding a synod at <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> Nicholas returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with a Norman army which reconquered Pr&aelig;neste, Tusculum, and Numentanum for the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and forced <a href="../cathen/02429b.htm">Benedict X</a> to capitulate at Galeria (autumn of 1059). <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the pontificate, was now created <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>. In order to secure the general acceptance of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> enacted at the synod of 1059, Cardinal Stephen, in the latter part of that year, was sent to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> where he presided over the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of Vienne (31 January, 1060) and Tours (17 February, 1060). The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> which introduced a new method of papal election had caused great dissatisfaction in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, because it reduced the imperial right of confirmation to the precarious condition of a personal privilege granted at will; but, assured of Norman protection, Nicholas could fearlessly renew the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> at the Lateran <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in 1060. After this council Cardinal Stephen, who had accomplished his mission to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, appeared as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. For five days he vainly solicited an audience at court and then returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. His fruitless mission was followed by a German synod which annulled all the ordinances of Nicholas II and pronounced his deposition. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> answer was a repetition of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> concerning elections at the synod of 1061, at which the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a> among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was likewise renewed. He lies buried in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Reparata at Florence of which city he had remained <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> even after his elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne. His pontificate, though of short duration, was marked by events fraught with momentous and far-reaching consequences.
