<h1>Pope Nicholas IV</h1>  

<p>(GIROLAMO MASCI)

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/01774a.htm">Ascoli</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>; died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 4 April, 1292. He was of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> extraction, and at an early age entered the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>. In 1272 he was sent as a delegate to Constantinople to invite the participation of the Greeks in the <a href="../cathen/09476c.htm">Second Council of Lyons</a>. Two years later he succeeded <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> in the generalship of his order. While he was on a mission to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to promote the restoration of peace between that country and Castile, he was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a> with the title of Santa Pudenziana (1278) and in 1281 <a href="../cathen/09724a.htm">Martin IV</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11421a.htm">Palestrina</a>. After the death of <a href="../cathen/07459a.htm">Honorius IV</a> (3 April, 1287), the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was for a time hopelessly divided in its selection of a successor. When fever had carried off six of the electors, the others, with the sole exception of Girolamo, left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It was not until the following year that they reassembled and on 15 February, 1288, unanimously elected him to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. Obedience and a second election however (22 February) were alone capable of overcoming his reluctance to accept the supreme pontificate. He was the first <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and in loving remembrance of <a href="../cathen/11056a.htm">Nicholas III</a> he assumed the name of Nicholas IV.

<p>The reign of the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was not characterized by sufficient independence. The undue influence exercised at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the Colonna is especially noteworthy and was so apparent even during his lifetime that Roman wits represented him encased in a column &mdash; the distinctive mark of the Colonna <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> &mdash; out of which only his tiara-covered head emerged. The efforts of <a href="../cathen/13218b.htm">Rudolf of Habsburg</a> to receive the imperial crown at the hands of the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> were not successful. His failure was partly due to the estrangement consequent upon the attitude assumed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the question of the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> succession. As <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> suzerain of the kingdom, Nicholas annulled the treaty, concluded in 1288 through the mediation of Edward I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, which confirmed James of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> in the possession of the island, He lent his support to the rival claims of the House of Anjou and <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Charles II King of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> at <a href="../cathen/13054a.htm">Rieti</a>, 29 May, 1289, after the latter had expressly acknowledged the suzerainty of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> and promised not to accept any municipal dignity in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>. The action of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did not end the armed struggle for the possession of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> nor did it secure the kingdom permanently to the House of Anjou. <a href="../cathen/13218b.htm">Rudolf of Habsburg</a> also failed to obtain from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the repeal of the authorization, granted the French king, to levy <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in certain German districts for the prosecution of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the House of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>. When he appointed his son Albert to succeed Ladislaus IV of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (31 August, 1290), Nicholas claimed the realm as a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> fief and conferred it upon <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a>, son of Charles II of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>.

<p>In 1291 the fall of Ptolemais put an end to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> dominion in the East. Previous to this tragic event, Nicholas had in vain endeavoured to organize a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>. He now called upon all the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes to take up arms against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mussulman</a> and instigated the holding of councils to devise the means of sending assistance to the Holy Land. These <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were to discuss likewise the advisability of the union of the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Knights Templars</a> and Knights of St. John, as the dissensions among them had partly caused the loss of Ptolemais. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself initiated the preparations for the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> and fitted out twenty ships for the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. His appeals and his example remained unheeded, however, and nothing of permanent value was accomplished.

<p>Nicholas IV sent missionaries, among them the celebrated <a href="../cathen/08474a.htm">John of Montecorvino</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgarians</a>, <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a>, Tatars, and Chinese. By his constitution of 18 July, 1289, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> were granted one half of the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> and a share in the financial administration. In 1290 he renewed the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> known as the Apostolici. Nicholas was <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and learned; he contributed to the artistic beauty of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, building particularly a palace beside Santa Maria Maggiore, the church in which he was buried and where <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> erected an imposing monument to his memory.
