<h1>Pope Paschal I</h1>  

<p>(817-824)

<p>The date of his birth is unknown; he died in April, May, or June, 824. He was the son of a Roman named Bonosus. While still young he joined the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and was taken into the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a> (Lateran Palace) where he was instructed in the Divine Service and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a> having appointed him superior of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Stephen near the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Basilica of St. Peter</a> in the Vatican, he took care of the <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> who came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On the death of <a href="../cathen/14289b.htm">Stephen IV</a> (24 January, 817) Paschal was unanimously chosen as his successor. On the following day he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a>. He entered into relations with Emperor Louis, sending him several ambassadors in rapid succession. In 817 he received from the emperor a document, "Pactum Ludovicianum", confirming the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and possessions of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. This document with later amendments is still extant (cf. especially Sickel, "Das Privileg Ottos I f&uuml;r die r&ouml;mische Kirche", Innsbruck, 1883, 50 sqq., 174 sqq.). Paschal remained on friendly terms with the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> nobility and sent a special legation with rich gifts to the marriage of King Lothair I, son of Emperor Louis. In spring, 823, Lothair went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and on 5 April he was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> emperor by Paschal. Although the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself opposed the sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> emperors over <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Roman territory, high officials in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> palace, especially Primicerius Theodore and his son-in-law Leo Nomenculator, were at the head of the party which supported the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, and advocated the supremacy of the emperor. Shortly after the departure of King Lothair in 823, both these officials were blinded and killed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> servants. Paschal himself was accused of being the originator of this deed, but he cleared himself of suspicion by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. The ambassadors sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Emperor Louis to investigate the affair could not punish the perpetrators, as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> declared the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> officials guilty of treason. Paschal supported new missionary expeditions which went out from the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire. He sent a letter of introduction to Bishop Halitgar of Cambria, and appointed Archbishop Ebo of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Rheims</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> countries in Northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>.

<p>In 814 under Leo the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclastic controversy</a> broke out with renewed <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>. <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">Theodore of Studium</a>, the great champion of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, wrote repeatedly to Pope Paschal, who encouraged him to persevere. At the same time Theodosius of Constantinople, unlawfully made patriarch by Emperor Leo, sent a legation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The latter, however, remained loyal to the cause of <a href="../cathen/14574a.htm">Theodore of Studium</a>, and dispatched <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to Leo to win him from the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasts</a>, but without success. Numerous <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who had been driven out of <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greece</a> by Leo came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> where the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> received them kindly, assigning them places in the newly-erected <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, such as St. Praxedis, St. Cecilia, Sts. Sergius and Bacchus, near the Lateran Palace. Paschal was very active in completing, restoring, and beautifying churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> of St. Praxedis, St. Cecilia, and S. Maria in Dominica were completely rebuilt by him. The <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>, which at that time ornamented the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apses</a> of these three churches as well as the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of St. Zeno in St. Praxedis, demonstrate today the deterioration of this art. In St. Peter's he erected <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and altars, in which the remains of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Roman catacombs</a>, especially those of Sts. Processus and Marinianus, were placed. He also placed the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of many Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Praxedis where their names are still legible. The discovery of the relics of St. Cecilia and companions, and their translation to the new <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Cecilia in Trastevere, are well described in <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (cf. Kirsch, "Die hl. C&auml;cilia in der r&ouml;mischen Kirche des Altertums", Paderborn, 1910). He made great improvements in the choir of the church of S. Maria Maggiore. Paschal was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Praxedis, and is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a saint on 14 May.
