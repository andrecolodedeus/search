<h1>Pope Paschal II</h1>  

<p>(RAINERIUS).

<p>Succeeded <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a>, and reigned from 13 Aug., 1099, till he died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 21 Jan., 1118. Born in central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, he was received at an early age as a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in Cluny. In his twentieth year he was sent on business of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was retained at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, and made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of St. Clement's church. It was in this church that the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> met after the death of <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Pope Urban</a>, and Cardinal Rainerius was the unanimous choice of the sacred college. He protested vigorously against his election, maintaining, with some <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, that his monastic training had not fitted him to deal with the weighty problems which confronted the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> in that troublous age. His protestations were disregarded by his colleagues, and he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the following day in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. Once <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he betrayed no further hesitation and wielded the sceptre with a firm and prudent grasp. The main lines of his policy had been laid by the master minds of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory</a> and <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban</a>, in whose footsteps he faithfully followed, while the unusual length of his pontificate, joined to a great amiability of character, made his reign an important factor in the development of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> dominion. <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban II</a> had lived to witness the complete success of his wonderful movement for the liberation of the Holy Land and the defence of <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. He had died a fortnight after <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> fell into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>. To continue the work inaugurated by <a href="../cathen/15210a.htm">Urban</a> remained the fixed policy of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for many generations. Paschal laboured vigorously by <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> and journeys through <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to keep alive the crusading spirit. Of more vital importance was the Investiture Conflict. It was fortunate that the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert (Clement III)</a>, died a few months after the elevation of Paschal. Three other <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipopes</a>, Theodoric (1100), Aleric (1102), and Maginulf, who took the name of Sylvester IV (1105), were offered by the imperialistic faction; but the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was practically ended. Two of these pretendants were sent by Paschal to do penance in <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>; the third had little or no following. Henry IV, broken by his previous conflicts, had no desire to renew the struggle. He obstinately refused to <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjure</a> his claim to imperial investitures, and, consequently, was again <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, and died at <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, 7 Aug., 1106.

<p>His death and the accession of his son were of dubious advantage to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> cause; for although he had posed as the champion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he soon showed himself as unwilling as his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> had been to relinquish any of the pretensions of the crown. Since the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> continued to denounce and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> lay investitures in the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> over which he presided, the chief of which were at <a href="../cathen/07053b.htm">Guastalla</a> (1106) and Troyes (1107), and since Henry persisted in bestowing <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> at pleasure, the friendly relations between the two powers soon became strained. Paschal decided to change his proposed journey to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and proceeded to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where he was received enthusiastically by King Philip (who did penance for his <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and was reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>) and by the French people. Henry resented the discussion of a German question on foreign soil, though the question of Investitures was one of universal interest; and he threatened to cut the knot with his sword, as soon as circumstances permitted his going to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to receive the imperial crown. In August, 1110, he crossed the Alps with a well-organized army, and, what emphasized the entrance of a new factor in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> politics, accompanied by a band of imperialistic lawyers, one of whom, David, was of Celtic origin. Crushing out opposition on his way through the peninsula, Henry sent an embassy to arrange with the pontiff the preliminaries of his <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>. The outcome was embodied in the Concordat of Sutri. Before receiving the imperial crown, Henry was to <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjure</a> all claims to investitures, whilst the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> undertook to compel the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of the empire to restore all the temporal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges which they held from the crown.

<p>When the compact was made public in St. Peter's on the date assigned for the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>, 12 Feb., 1111, there arose a fierce tumult led by the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> who by one stroke of the pen had been degraded from the estate of princes of the empire to beggary. The indignation was the more intense, because the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> had been secured from a similar confiscation. After fruitless wrangling and three days of rioting, Henry carried the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and his <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> into captivity. Abandoned as he was by everyone, Paschal, after two months of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a>, yielded to the king that right of investiture against which so many heroes had contended. Henry's <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> rebounded upon himself. All <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> united in <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizing</a> him. The voices raised to condemn the faint-heartedness of Paschal were drowned by the universal denunciation of his oppressor. Paschal humbly acknowledged his weakness, but refused to break the promise he had made not to inflict any censure upon Henry for his <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. It was unfortunate for Paschal's memory that he should be so closely associated with the episode of Sutri. As head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he developed a far-reaching activity. He maintained discipline in every corner of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. The greatest champions of religion, men like <a href="../cathen/01546a.htm">St. Anselm of Canterbury</a>, looked up to him with reverence. He gave his approval to the new orders of <a href="../cathen/03792a.htm">C&icirc;teaux</a> and Fontevrauld. On his numerous journeys he brought the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> into direct contact with the people and dedicated a large number of churches. If it was not given to him to solve the problem of Investitures, he cleared the way for his more fortunate successor.
