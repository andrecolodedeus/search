<h1>Pope Paul I</h1>  

<p>(757-67)

<p>Date of birth unknown; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 28 June, 767. He was a brother of <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Stephen II</a>. They had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> at the Lateran palace. Stephen entrusted his brother, who approved of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> course in respect to King Pepin, with many important <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, among others with the restoration to the Roman States of the cities which had been seized by the Lombard Kings <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a> and Desiderius; these cities Desiderius promised to give up. While Paul was with his dying brother at the Lateran, a party of the Romans gathered in the house of Archdeacon Theophylact in order to secure the latter's succession to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">papal see</a>. However, immediately after the burial of Stephen (died 26 April, 757), Paul was elected by a large majority, and received episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> on the twenty-ninth of May. Paul continued his predecessor's policy towards the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king, Pepin, and thereby continued the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy over <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the districts of central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in opposition to the efforts of the Lombards and the Eastern Empire. Pepin sent a letter to the Roman people, exhorting them to remain steadfast to St. Peter. In the reply sent by the senate and the people of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king, the latter was urged to complete the enlargement of the Roman province which he had wrested from the barbarians, and to persevere in the work he had begun. In 758 a daughter was born to Pepin, and the king sent the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the cloth used at the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> as a present, renewing in this way the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sponsorship. Paul returned thanks and informed Pepin of the hostile action of Desiderius, who had failed to deliver the cities of <a href="../cathen/07692a.htm">Imola</a>, <a href="../cathen/11338a.htm">Osimo</a>, <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">Ancona</a>, and Bologna to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and had also devastated the Pentapolis on his expedition against the rebellious Dukes of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> and <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>. The two duchies were conquered and annexed by Desiderius (758). At <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> Desiderius had a conference with the Greek ambassador Georgios, and agreed on a mutual alliance of <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> and Lombards in central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. On his way home Desiderius came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> demanded the return of the aforesaid cities, he refused to comply. He promised to give back Imola, but on condition that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should persuade Pepin to send back the Lombard hostages whom the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king had carried off, some time before, at the time of his second victory over the Lombard <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">King Aistulf</a>. If Paul would not do this, Desiderius threatened to go to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with him. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was in great straits. He found it difficult even to get the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king informed of his position. He gave two letters to Bishop George of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> and the Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Stephen, his ambassadors to Pepin, who made the journey with the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> messenger Ruodpertus. In the one letter that was to secure the envoys a safe passage through Lombard territory, he agreed to the demands of Desiderius and begged Pepin to accede to the wishes of the Lombards by making a treaty of peace and returning the hostages. At the same time the envoys were to give the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king a second secret letter, in which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> communicated to him the latest occurrences, informed him of the agreement of Desiderius with the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> for the conquest of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, and implored Pepin to come to the aid of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, to punish the Lombard king, and to force him to yield the towns retained by him. Towards the close of 759 another envoy was sent to Pepin. Early in 760 two <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> envoys, Bishop Remidius of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, brother to Pepin, and Duke Antschar, came to Desiderius, who promised to return its patrimony to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> in April, and also to yield the towns demanded by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. But he again refused to carry out his promises, dallied, and even forced his way into Roman territory. Once more Paul implored the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king's help. The position of affairs was made even more threatening by Byzantine action. Georgios had gone from southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to the court of Pepin and had here won over a <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal envoy</a>, Marinus. With all his efforts Georgios could not move Pepin. In 760 a report spread through <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> that a large Byzantine fleet was under sail for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom. Later it was reported that the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> intended to send an army to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> Sergius of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> received a letter from the Byzantine emperor, in which the latter sought to obtain the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> submission of the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. The same attempt was also made in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. Sergius sent the letter of the emperor to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> notified Pepin. In case of a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Eastern Empire it was important to make sure of the support of the Lombards, consequently Pepin desired to come to an agreement with Desiderius. Thereupon the Lombard king showed more complaisance in the question of the Roman patrimony included in the Lombard territory, and when he visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 765, the boundary disputes between him and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> were arranged. The <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king now directed Desiderius to aid the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in recovering the Roman patrimony in the regions in southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> under Byzantine rule, and to support the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of these districts. Paul's opposition to the schemes of the <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> Copronymus had no real political basis. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> aim was to defend <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Trinity and the veneration of images against the Eastern emperor. Paul repeatedly dispatched <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> and letters in regard to the veneration of images to the emperor at Byzantium. Constantine sent envoys to western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> who in coming to King Pepin did not disguise their intention to negotiate with him concerning dogmatic questions, also about the submission of the Exarchate of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> to Byzantine suzerainty. Papal <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> also came to Pepin in regard to these matters. On their return the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> were able to reassure the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as to the views of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> ruler, who kept two of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> envoys, Bishop George and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Peter, near him. In 767 a <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> synod was held at Gentilly, near <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, at which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> doctrines concerning the Trinity and the veneration of images were maintained. Paul showed great activity and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in encouraging <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He turned his paternal home into a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and near it built the church of San Silvestro in Capite. The founding of this church led to his holding a synod at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 761. To this church and other churches of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Paul transferred the bones of numerous <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> from the decayed sanctuaries in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> devastated by the Lombards in 756. He transferred the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/11781b.htm">St. Petronilla</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">St. Domitilla</a> to a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in St. Peter's erected by his predecessor for this purpose. The legend of <a href="../cathen/11781b.htm">St. Petronilla</a> caused her at that era to be regarded as a daughter of St. Peter, and as such she became the special Roman patroness of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> rulers. Paul also built an oratory of the Blessed Virgin in St. Peter's, and a church in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Apostles on the Via Sacra beyond the Roman Forum. He died near the church of San Paolo fuori le mura, where he had gone during the heat of summer. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in this church, but after three months his body was transferred to St. Peter's. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> also praises the <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">Christian charity</a> and benevolence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> which he united with firmness. Paul is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a saint. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on the twenty-eighth of June.
