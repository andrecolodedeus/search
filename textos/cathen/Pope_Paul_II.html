<h1>Pope Paul II</h1>  

<p>(PIETRO BARBO)

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, 1417; elected 30 August, 1464; died 26 July, 1471; son of Niccolo Barbo and Polixena Condulmer, sister of <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>. Although he studied for a business career he received an excellent religious <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and, at the elevation of his uncle to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, entered the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>. He became <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Bologna, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03545b.htm">Cervia</a> and of <a href="../cathen/15404c.htm">Vicenza</a>, and in 1440 <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal-deacon</a>. Noted for his generosity and imposing appearance, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, as he was called, was very influential under <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugene IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03187a.htm">Calixtus III</a>, less so under <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>. He became the latter's successor, and owed his election partly to the dissatisfaction of some of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> with the policy of his predecessor. To this could be traced the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> which Barbo <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swore</a> to at the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, but which he rightfully set aside after election, since it was opposed to the monarchial constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Paul II delighted in display. He introduced splendid carnival festivities, built the palace of S. Marco (now di Venezia), revised the municipal <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, organized relief work among the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, granted pensions to some <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and to all the privilege of wearing the red <a href="../cathen/02577a.htm">biretta</a>. His suppression in 1466 of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of abbreviators aroused much opposition, intensified by a similar measure against the Roman Academy. Platina, a member of both organizations, who had been repeatedly <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>, retaliated by writing a <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnious</a> biography of Paul II.

<p>That Paul II was not opposed to Humanistic studies, as such, is evidenced by the fact that he protected <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, encouraged the art of printing, and was himself a collector of works of ancient art. The suppression of the Roman Academy was justified by the moral degeneracy and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> attitude which it fostered. On the other hand the charge of immorality brought against Paul II by <a href="../cathen/07010a.htm">Gregory of Heimburg</a> is untenable. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> punished the Fraticelli in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, prosecuted <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, decreed in 1470 the observance of the jubilee every twenty-five years, and made an unsuccessful attempt at uniting <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turkish</a> question received his earnest attention, particularly after the fall of Negropont (1470). Financial assistance was granted to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and the Albanian leader Scanderbeg. No general results were obtained, however, owing to the lack of co-operation among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> powers; to disturbances in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, where Paul II suppressed the robber <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knights</a> of Anguillara, and perhaps chiefly to the conflict between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and King George Podiebrad of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>.
