<h1>Pope Paul IV</h1>  

<p>(G<font size=-2>IOVANNI </font> P<font size=-2>IETRO</font> C<font size=-2>ARAFFA </font>).

<p>Born near <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, 28 June, 1476; elected 23 May, 1555; died 18 Aug., 1559. The Caraffa were one of the most illustrious of the noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and had given distinguished scions to <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. The name of Cardinal Oliviero Caraffa recurs frequently in the history of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> during the days of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. One of the great <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> merits was that of superintending the training of his young relative, Giovanni Pietro, whom he introduced to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Court in 1494, and in whose favour he resigned the See of <a href="../cathen/03659a.htm">Chieti</a> (in Latin, <em>Theate</em>), from which word he was thenceforward known as <em>Theatinus.</em> <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> sent him on an embassy to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and retained him for some years as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. His residence in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> served to accentuate that detestation of Spanish rule in his native land which characterized his public policy during his pontificate. From early childhood he led a blameless life; and that longing for asceticism which had prompted him to seek admission into the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> Orders asserted itself in 1524 when he persuaded <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>, though with difficulty, to accept the resignation of his <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> and permit him to enter the congregation of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> regular founded by St. Cajetan, but popularly named "Theatines", after Caraffa, their first general. The young congregation suffered more than its share during the sack of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1527, and its few members retired to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. But the sharp <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> had perceived the importance of the institute in his projected reform of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and he summoned the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a> back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Caraffa was placed by the pontiff on the committee named to outline the project of reform of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Court; and on 22 Dec., 1536 he was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> with the title of San Pancrazio. Later he was made <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>; but, owing to the emperor's distrust and fear of him, it was only with difficulty he could maintain his episcopal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Although Caraffa was highly <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> and surpassed most of his contemporaries in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Greek and Hebrew, still he remained throughout <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> in life and thought. His favourite author was <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>. The few <em>opuscula</em> which he found time to write were <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> in character. For the party of <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole</a>, <a href="../cathen/04323c.htm">Contarini</a>, and Morone he had the most heartfelt detestation; and his elevation boded them no <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Caraffa was the head and front of every effort made by <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> in the interest of reform. He reorganized the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> on <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> lines and for a generation was the terror of misbelievers. How so austere a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> could be chosen <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was a mystery to everyone, especially to himself. "I have never conferred a favour on a human being", he said. It is most likely that the octogenarian would have refused the dignity, were it not that the emperor's agent, Cardinal Mendoza, had pronounced decidedly that Charles would not permit Caraffa to be <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. This was to challenge every principle for which the aged <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> had stood during his long career. He was elected in spite of the emperor, and for four years held aloft the banner of the independence of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Historians seem to be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> towards Paul IV. That unbending Italian patriot, born whilst <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was "a lyre with four strings", <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, was certainly justified in using the prestige of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> to preserve some relics of liberty for his native country. The Austrian and Spanish Habsburgers treated Paul IV with studied contempt, and thus forced him to enter an alliance with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Neither in the matter of the succession to the empire nor in the conclusion of the religious peace were the interests of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> consulted in the slightest degree.

<p>Paul IV elevated to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> his nephew Carlo Caraffa, a man utterly unworthy and without any <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> training, and enriched other relatives with <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> and estates taken from those who favoured the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>. At the end of the unfortunate <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with Philip II the aged <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> lost <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in his nephews and banished them from the Court. Still more disastrous were his relations with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, which had been reconciled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Mary, and <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Cardinal Pole</a>. Paul IV refused to sanction <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole's</a> settlement in regard to the confiscated goods of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and demanded restitution. <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole</a> himself was relieved by the pontiff of his legatine office and ordered to come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to stand before the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>. Upon the death of Mary and <a href="../cathen/12201b.htm">Pole</a>, he rejected Elizabeth's claim to the crown, on the ground that she was of <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> birth. His activity was more fruitful in the spiritual concerns of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He could boast that no day passed without seeing a new <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of reform. He made the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> a powerful engine of government, and was no respector of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. The great <a href="../cathen/10575a.htm">Cardinal Morone</a> was brought before the tribunal on suspicion of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and committed to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. Paul established the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Netherlands</a> and in the Orient.

<p>The pontificate of Paul IV was a great disappointment. He who at the beginning was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by a public <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, lived to see it thrown down and mutilated by the hostile populace. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in St. Peter's 19 Aug., 1559, and was later transferred to S. Maria sopra Minerva.
