<h1>Pope Paul V</h1>  

<p>(CAMILLO BORGHESE).

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 17 Sept., 1550; elected 16 May, 1605; died 28 Jan., 1621. Although proud to call himself, as we read on the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a> and on his epitaph, a Roman, Borghese was descended from a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> which held important positions in that city, and claimed St. Catherine for a relative. Their removal to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the endless disturbances which made life in <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> unbearable. Camillo was carefully trained in <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">jurisprudence</a> at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> and Padua, and became a canonist of marked ability. He rose in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> career steadily, if not rapidly; in 1596 he was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/04027a.htm">Clement VIII</a>, and became <a href="../cathen/03341b.htm">Cardinal-Vicar</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He held aloof from all parties and factions, devoting all his spare time to his law-books. In consequence, on the death of <a href="../cathen/09166a.htm">Leo XI</a>, all eyes were centred on him, and he ascended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne without engagement or <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of any sort. His legal training was soon visible in all his words and actions. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing of compromises, and proceeded to rule the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> not from the standpoint of diplomacy but from the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a>. He conceived it his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to maintain inviolate every right and claim advanced by his predecessors. This made his character at times assume a very stern and uncompromising aspect. His first public act was to send home to their sees the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and even the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who were sojourning at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> upon one or other pretext. The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> had declared it a grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to be an absentee. That he was engaged in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> doing the business of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> made no difference. Paul was soon involved in controversy with various cities of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> on matters concerning <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> and the relations between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. The bitterest quarrel was with the proud <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Republic of Venice</a>, which refused to acknowledge the exemption of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the civil courts and passed two <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> obnoxious to the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Roman Curia</a>, the first forbidding the alienation of real <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> in favour of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, the second demanding approval of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a> for the building of new churches. Paul demanded the repeal of these anti-clerical ordinances, and insisted that two <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who had been committed to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> should be surrendered to the <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical court</a>. The dispute became daily more bitter and gradually developed into a broad discussion of the relative position of the <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. What gave the quarrel a <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> importance was the ability of the champions who entered the field on either side. For the claims of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> stood Cardinals <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> and <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>; the cause of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> was defended by the <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a> <a href="../cathen/13477b.htm">Paolo Sarpi</a>, a man of wonderful literary skill and a sworn enemy of the Roman Court. On 17 April, 1600, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> pronounced sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against the doge, Senate, and Government collectively. He allowed a very short space for submission, after which he imposed an <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> on the city. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> had now to take sides for or against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. With the exception of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, who were immediately expelled, the entire body of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular</a> and <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> held with the Government and continued to hold services, notwithstanding the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>. The festival of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a> was celebrated with unusual splendour, and <a href="../cathen/13477b.htm">Sarpi</a> said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> for the first time in years. The <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> lasted about a year; and peace was patched up through the mediation of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The Republic refused to repeal the obnoxious <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> openly, but promised "to conduct itself with its accustomed <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>". With these obscure words the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was forced to be content; he removed the censures 22 March, 1607. The <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a> and <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> were permitted to return; an exception was made against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> watched vigilantly over the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in every nation. On 9 July, 1606, he wrote a friendly letter to James I of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to congratulate him on his accession to the throne, and referred with grief to the plot recently made against the life of the monarch. But he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> him not to make the innocent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> suffer for the crime of a few. He promises to exhort all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the realm to be submissive and loyal to their sovereign in all things not opposed to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Unfortunately the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance James demanded of his subjects contained clauses to which no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> could in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> subscribe. It was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> condemned in two Briefs, 22 Sept., 1606, and 23 Aug., 1607. This condemnation occasioned the bitter dissension between the party of the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> George Blackwell and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who submitted to the decision of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> were directed to healing the disputes among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and to giving moral and material aid to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Union. He survived the battle of Prague, which put an end to the short reign of the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> "winter-king".

<p>Paul V was no more free from nepotism than the other pontiffs of that century. But if he seemed to show too many favours to his relatives, it must be said that they were capable men of blameless lives, and devoted their large revenues to the embellishment of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Paul had the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of putting the finishing touches to <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>, which had been building for a century. He enriched the Vatican Library, was fond of art, and encouraged <a href="../cathen/12771a.htm">Guido Reni</a>. He <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> and <a href="../cathen/06205c.htm">St. Frances of Rome</a>. He <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> Sts. Ignatius Loyola, Francis Xavier, Philip Neri, Theresa the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, Louis Bertrand, <a href="../cathen/14696a.htm">Thomas of Villanova</a>, and Isidore of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. During his pontificate a large number of new institutes for <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and charity added new lustre to religion. His remains were placed in the magnificent Borghese <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in St. Mary Major's, where his monument is universally admired.
