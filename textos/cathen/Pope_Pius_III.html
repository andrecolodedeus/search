<h1>Pope Pius III</h1>  

<p>(Francesco Todeschini Piccolomini).

<p>B. at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, 29 May, 1439; elected 22 Sept., 1503; d. in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 18 Oct., 1503, after a pontificate of four weeks. Piccolomini was the son of a sister of <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>. He had passed his boyhood in destitute circumstances when his uncle took him into his household, bestowed upon him his family name and arms, and superintended his training and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. He studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> and immediately after receiving the doctorate as canonist was appointed by his uncle <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, and on 5 March, 1460, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal-deacon</a> with the title of S. Eustachio. The following month he was sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01463d.htm">March of Ancona</a>, with the experienced <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09719a.htm">Marsico</a> as his counsellor. "The only thing objectionable about him", says Voigt (Enea Silvio, III, 531), "was his youth; for in the administration of his legation and in his later conduct at the curia he proved to be a man of spotless character and many-sided capacity." He was sent by <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, where he acquitted himself with eminent success, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of German that he had acquired in his uncle's house being of great advantage to him. During the worldly reigns of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a> he kept away from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as much as possible. Sigismondo de Conti, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him well tells us that "he left no moment unoccupied; his time for study was before daybreak; he spent his mornings in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and his midday hours in giving audiences, to which the humblest had easy access. He was so temperate in food and drink that he only allowed himself an evening meal every other day." Yet this is the excellent man to whom Gregorovius in his "Lucrezia Borgia", without a shadow of authority, gives a dozen children&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> being repeated by Brosch and Creighton. After the death of <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> could not unite on the principal candidates, d'Amboise, Rovere, and Sforza; hence the great majority cast their votes for Piccolomini, who though only sixty-four was, like his uncle, tortured with gout and was prematurely old. He took the name of Pius III in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of his uncle, was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> on 8 Oct., after receiving <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> and episcopal orders. The strain of the long <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was so great that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sank under it. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in St. Peter's, but his remains were later transferred to S. Andrea della Valle where he rests by the side of <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a>.
