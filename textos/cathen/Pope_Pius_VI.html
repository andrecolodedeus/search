<h1>Pope Pius VI</h1>  

<p>(G<font size=-2>IOVANNI</font> A<font size=-2 >NGELICO</font> B<font size=-2>RASCHI</font>).

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/03546b.htm">Cesena</a>, 27 December, 1717; elected 15 February, 1775; died at <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence, France</a>, 29 Aug., 1799. He was of a noble but impoverished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> at the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">College</a> of <a href="../cathen/03546b.htm">Cesena</a> and studied <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>. After a diplomatic mission to <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, he was appointed <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> secretary and canon of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a> in 1755. <a href="../cathen/04032a.htm">Clement XIII</a> appointed him treasurer of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> in 1766, and <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> made him a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> in 1775. He then retired to the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>, of which he was <a href="../cathen/04155b.htm">commendatory abbot</a>, until his election as Pius VI.

<p><a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> had at first combined to prevent his election, because he was believed to be a friend of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>; he was well disposed towards the order, but he dared not <a href="../cathen/13007a.htm">revoke</a> the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of their <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppression</a>. Still he ordered the liberation of their general, <a href="../cathen/13033a.htm">Ricci</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> in the Castle of Sant&rsquo; Angelo in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but the general died before the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of liberation arrived. Upon the request of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> he permitted the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to retain their <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>; while in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, he permitted an uninterrupted continuation of the order. Soon after his accession he took steps to root out the Gallican <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy which had been spread in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> by <a href="../cathen/07463a.htm">Hontheim</a> (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">F<font size=-2>EBRONIANISM</font></a>. <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> forbade the Austrian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to apply to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for faculties of any kind, and <a href="../cathen/10453a.htm">suppressed</a> innumerable <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Pius VI resolved to go to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>; he left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 27 Feb., 1782, and arrived in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> on 22 March. The emperor received him respectfully, though the minister, <a href="../cathen/08611b.htm">Kaunitz</a>, neglected even the ordinary rules of etiquette. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> remained at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> until 22 April, 1782. All that he obtained from the emperor was the promise that his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms would not contain any violation of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, or compromise the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The emperor accompanied the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on his return as far as the Monastery of Mariabrunn, and <a href="../cathen/10453a.htm">suppressed</a> this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> a few hours after the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had left it. Scarcely had the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> reached <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> when he again saw himself compelled to protest against the emperor's unjustifiable confiscation of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a>. But when <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> filled the vacant See of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> of his own authority, Pius solemnly protested, and it was probably at this occasion that he threatened the emperor with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. On 23 Dec., 1783, the emperor unexpectedly came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to return the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> visit. He was determined to continue his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms, and made known to the Spanish diplomat, Azara, his project of separating the German Church entirely from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The latter, however, dissuaded him from taking this fatal step. To avoid worse things, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> granted him the right of nominating the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the Duchies of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and Mantua, in a <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordat</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 20 Jan., 1784 (see Nussi, "Conventiones de rebus ecclesiasticis et civilibus inter S. Sedem et civilem potestatem", Mainz, 1870, 138-9).

<p>Joseph's example was followed in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> by his brother, the Grand Duke Leopold II and Bishop Scipio Ricci of Pistoia. Here the antipapal reforms culminated in the <a href="../cathen/12116c.htm">Synod of Pistoia</a> in 1786, where the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a> and <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a> were sanctioned, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy was eliminated. In his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/02068b.htm">"Auctorem fidei"</a> of 28 Aug., 1794, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> condemned the acts, and in particular eighty-five propositions of this synod. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> the three <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Electors of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, and Cologne, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> attempted to curtail the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority by convening a congress at Ems (q.v.). With <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> relations became very friendly after the accession of Maria I in 1777, and a satisfactory <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordat</a> was concluded in 1778 (Nussi, loc. cit., 138-39). In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> the Governments to a great extent followed in the footsteps of <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a>. But the most sweeping anti-ecclesiastical reforms were carried out in the Two Sicilies. Ferdinand IV refused the <a href="../cathen/05707a.htm">exequatur</a> to all <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal briefs</a> that were obtained without the royal permission, and claimed the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nominate</a> all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> beneficiaries. Pius VI refused to accept the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> that were nominated by the king and, as a result, there were in 1784 thirty vacant sees in the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a> alone, which number had increased to sixty in 1798. The king, moreover, refused to acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> suzerainty which had existed for eight hundred years. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> repeatedly made overtures, but the king persisted in nominating to all the vacant <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. In April, 1791, when more than half the sees in the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a> were vacant, a temporary compromise was reached and in that year sixty-two vacant sees were filled (Rinieri, loc. cit., infra).

<p>In response to the <a href="../cathen/11777a.htm">application</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of April, 1788, erected the <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">See of Baltimore</a>.

<p>Pius VI put the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> finances on a firmer basis; drained the marshy lands near Citt&#224; della Pieve, <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, and Trevi; deepened the harbours of Porto d'Anzio and <a href="../cathen/14518c.htm">Terracina</a>; added a new <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> to the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Basilica of St. Peter</a>; completed the Musee Pio-Clementino, and enriched it with many costly pieces of art; restored the Via Appia; and drained the greater part of the Pontine Marshes.

<p>After the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, Pius rejected the "Constitution civile du clerg&eacute;" on 13 March, 1791, suspended the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that accepted it, provided as well as he could for the banished <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and protested against the execution of Louis XVI. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> retaliated by annexing the small <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> territories of <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a> and Venaissin. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> co-operation with the Allies against the French Republic, and the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of the French attach&eacute;, Basseville, at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, brought on by his own fault, led to <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> attack on the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>. At the Truce of Bologna (25 June, 1796) <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> dictated the terms: twenty-one million francs, the release of all political criminals, free access of French ships into the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> harbours, the occupation of the Romagna by French troops etc. At the Peace of Tolentino (19 Feb., 1797) Pius VI was compelled to surrender <a href="../cathen/02158a.htm">Avignon</a>, Venaissin, <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, Bologna, and the Romagna; and to pay fifteen million francs and give up numerous costly works of art and <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. In an attempt to revolutionize <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the French General Duphot was shot and killed, whereupon the French took <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 10 Feb., 1798, and proclaimed the Roman Republic on 15 Feb. Because the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> refused to submit, he was forcibly taken from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the night of 20 Feb., and brought first to <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> and then to Florence. At the end of March, 1799, though seriously ill, he was hurried to <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a>, <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a>, <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, then over the Alps to Brian&#231;on and Grenoble, and finally to <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a>, where he succumbed to his sufferings before he could be brought further. He was first buried at <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a>, but the remains were transferred to <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 17 Feb., 1802 (see <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">N<font size=-2>APOLEON</font> I</a>). His <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> in a kneeling position by <a href="../cathen/03298b.htm">Canova</a> was placed in the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Basilica of St. Peter</a> before the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Prince of the Apostles</a>.
