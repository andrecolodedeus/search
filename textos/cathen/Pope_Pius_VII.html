<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope Pius VII</h1>  

<p>(B<font size=-2>ARNABA</font> C<font size=-2>HIARAMONTI</font>).

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/03546b.htm">Cesena</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>, 14 August, 1742; <a href="../cathen/11456a.htm">elected</a> at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> 14 March, 1800; died 20 August, 1823.

<p>His father was Count Scipione Chiaramonti, and his mother, of the noble house of Ghini, was a lady of rare <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> who in 1763 entered a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> at <a href="../cathen/05785a.htm">Fano</a>. Here she foretold, in her son's hearing, as Pius VII himself later related, his elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and his protracted sufferings. Barnaba received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> in the college for nobles at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. At the age of sixteen he entered the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> del Monte, near <a href="../cathen/03546b.htm">Cesena</a>, where he was called Brother Gregory. After the completion of his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies, he was appointed professor at <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in colleges of his order. He was teaching at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Callisto in the latter city at the accession of <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, who was a friend of the Chiaramonti <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and subsequently appointed Barnaba <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The appointment did not meet with the universal <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the inmates, and complaints were soon lodged with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority against the new <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Investigation, however, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the charges to be unfounded, and <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> soon raised him to further dignities. After conferring upon him successively the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a> and Imola he created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> 14 Feb., 1785. When in 1797 the French invaded northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Chiaramonti as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07692a.htm">Imola</a> addressed to his flock the wise and practical instruction to refrain from useless resistance to the overwhelming and threatening forces of the enemy. The town of <a href="../cathen/09417b.htm">Lugo</a> refused to submit to the invaders and was delivered up to a pillage which had an end only when the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, who had counselled subjection, suppliantly cast himself on his knees before General Augereau. That Chiaramonti could adapt himself to new situations clearly appears from a <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> delivered in 1797, in which he advocates submission to the Cisalpine Republic, as there is no opposition between a democratic form of government and the constitution of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In spite of this attitude he was repeatedly accused of treasonable proceedings towards the republic, but always successfully vindicated his conduct.

<p>According to an ordinance issued by <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a>, 13 Nov., 1798, the city where the largest number of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> was to be found at the time of his death was to be the scene of the subsequent election. In conformity with these instructions the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> met in <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, after his death (29 Aug., 1799), in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of San Giorgio at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. The place was agreeable to the emperor, who bore the expense of the election. Thirty-four <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> were in attendance on the opening day, 30 Nov., 1799; to these was added a few days later Cardinal Herzan, who acted simultaneously as imperial commissioner. It was not long before the election of Cardinal Bellisomi seemed assured. He was, however, unacceptable to the Austrian party, who favoured Cardinal Mattei. As neither candidate could secure a sufficient number of votes, a third name, that of <a href="../cathen/06471b.htm">Cardinal Gerdil</a>, was proposed, but his election was vetoed by <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>. At last, after the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> had lasted three months, some of the neutral <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, including Maury, suggested Chiaramonti as a suitable candidate and, with the tactful support of the secretary of the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Ercole Consalvi</a>, he was elected. The new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> as Pius VII on 21 March, 1800, at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. He then left this city in an Austrian vessel for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he made his solemn entry on 3 July, amid the universal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the populace. Of all-important consequence for his reign was the elevation on 11 Aug., 1800, of <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Ercole Consalvi</a>, one of the greatest statesmen of the nineteenth century, to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">college of cardinals</a> and to the office of secretary of state. <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> retained to the end the confidence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, although the conflict with <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> forced him out of office for several years.

<p>With no country was Pius VII more concerned during his reign than with <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">revolution</a> had destroyed the old order in religion no less than in politics. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Bonaparte</a>, as first consul, signified his readiness to enter into negotiations tending to the settlement of the religious question. These advances led to the conclusion of the historic <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">Concordat of 1801</a>, which for over a hundred years governed the relations of the French Church with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (on this compact; the journey of Pius VII to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> for the imperial <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>; his captivity and restoration, see <a href="../cathen/04204a.htm">CONCORDAT OF 1801</a>, <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">CONSALVI</a>; and <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">NAPOLEON I</a>). After the fall of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> a new concordat was negotiated between Pius VII and Louis XVIII. It provided for an additional number of French <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and abrogated the <a href="../cathen/01756a.htm">Organic Articles</a>. But liberal and Gallican opposition to it was so strong that it could never be carried out. One of its objects was later realized when in 1822 the circumscription <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Patern&aelig; Caritatis" erected thirty new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>.

<p>At the Peace of Lun&eacute;ville in 1801, some German princes lost their hereditary <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and dominions through the cession of the left bank of the Rhine to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. When it became known that they contemplated compensating their loss by the secularization of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> lands, Pius VII instructed Dalberg, Elector of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, on 2 Oct., 1802, to use all his influence for the protection of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Dalberg, however, displayed more ardour for his own advancement than <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the defence of religious interests, and the seizure of <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">ecclesiastical property</a> was permitted in 1803 by the Imperial Deputation at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>. The measure resulted in enormous loss for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was powerless to resist its execution. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reorganization of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> now became a pressing need. <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> soon opened negotiations in view of a concordat and was shortly after followed by W&uuml;rtemburg. But <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> would rather treat with the central imperial government than with individual states, and after the suppression of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> aim was to obtain a uniform concordat for the whole Confederation of the Rhine. Subsequent events prevented any agreement before <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> downfall. At the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1814-15) <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> in vain advocated the restoration of the former <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization. Soon after this event the individual German States separately entered into negotiations with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the first concordat was concluded with <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> in 1817. In 1821 Pius VII <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "De salute animarum" the agreement concluded with <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, and the same year another <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, "Provida Solersque", made a fresh distribution of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of the Upper Rhine. An arrangement with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> based on mutual concessions was likewise contemplated in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> in regard to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs, notably episcopal nominations (the veto). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> administration favoured the project the more readily seeing that common resistance to <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> had brought the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government more closely together, and that it still stood in need of the assistance of English might and diplomacy. But <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> opposition to the scheme was so determined that nothing could be done, and the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> remained free from all state control. Similar freedom prevailed in the growing Church of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, in which country Pius VII erected in 1808 the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, New York, Philadelphia, and Bardstown, with Baltimore as the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>. To these <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were added those of <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a> and Richmond in 1820, and that of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a> in 1821.

<p>One of the most remarkable successes of his pontificate was the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Pontifical States</a>, secured at the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> representative <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a>. Only a small strip of land remained in the power of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, and this usurpation was protested. In the temporal administration of these states some of the features making for uniformity and efficiency introduced by the French were judiciously retained, the <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the nobility were abolished, and the ancient privileges of the municipalities suppressed. Considerable opposition developed against these measures, and the <a href="../cathen/03330c.htm">Carbonari</a> even threatened rebellion; but <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a> had their leaders prosecuted and on 13 Sept., 1821, Pius VII condemned their principles. Of a more serious nature was the revolution which in 1820 broke out in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and which, owing to its anticlerical character, gave great concern to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. It restricted the authority of <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical courts</a> (26 Sept., 1830); decreed (23 Oct.) the suppression of a large number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and prohibited (14 April, 1821) the forwarding of financial contributions to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It also secured the appointment of Canon Villanueva, a public advocate of the abolition of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, as Spanish ambassador to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and, upon the refusal of Pius VII to accept him, broke off diplomatic relations with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in 1823. This same year, however, the armed intervention of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> suppressed the revolution and King Ferdinand VII repealed the anti-Catholic <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>.

<p>During the latter part of the reign of Pius VII, the prestige of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> was enhanced by the presence in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of several <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> rulers. The Emperor and Empress of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, accompanied by their daughter, made an official visit to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1819. The King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1821 and was followed in 1822 by the King of <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. The blind Charles Emmanuel IV of <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, and King Charles IV of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and his queen, permanently resided in the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a>. Far more glorious to Pius VII personally is the fact that, after the downfall of his persecutor <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a>, he gladly offered a refuge in his capital to the members of the Bonaparte <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Princess Letitia, the deposed emperor's mother, lived there; likewise did his brothers Lucien and Louis and his uncle, <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Cardinal Fesch</a>. So forgiving was Pius that upon hearing of the severe captivity in which the imperial <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> was held at St. Helena, he requested <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Cardinal Consalvi</a> to plead for leniency with the Prince-Regent of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. When he was informed of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> desire for the ministrations of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, he sent him the Abb&eacute; Vignali as <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>.

<p>Under Pius's reign <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was also the favourite abode of artists. Among these it suffices to cite the illustrious names of the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> <a href="../cathen/03298b.htm">Canova</a>, the Dane Thorwaldsen, the Austrian F&uuml;hrich, and the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> <a href="../cathen/11362a.htm">Overbeck</a>, Pforr, <a href="../cathen/13518a.htm">Schadow</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04376a.htm">Cornelius</a>. Pius VII added numerous <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and printed volumes to the Vatican Library; reopened the English, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scottish</a>, and German Colleges at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and established new chairs in the Roman College. He reorganized the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of the Propaganda</a>, and condemned the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> Societies. In 1805 he received at Florence the unconditional submission of Scipione Ricci, the former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12117a.htm">Pistoia-Prato</a>, who had refused obedience to <a href="../cathen/12131a.htm">Pius VI</a> in his condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/12116c.htm">Synod of Pistoia</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppressed Society of Jesus</a> he re-established for <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> in 1801, for the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1804; for America, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> in 1813, and for the Universal Church on 7 August, 1814.

<p>On 6 July, 1823, Pius VII fell in his apartment and fractured his thigh. He was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to take to his bed, never to rise again. During his illness the magnificent <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">basilica of St. Paul Without the Walls</a> was destroyed by fire, a calamity which was never revealed to him. The gentle but <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageous</a> pontiff breathed his last in the presence of his devoted <a href="../cathen/04262a.htm">Consalvi</a>, who was soon to follow him to the grave.
