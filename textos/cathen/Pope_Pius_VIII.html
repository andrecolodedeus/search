<h1>Pope Pius VIII</h1>  

<p>(Francesco Xaverio Castiglione).

<p>B. at Cingoli, 20 Nov., 1761; elected 31 March, 1829; d. 1 Dec., 1830. He came of a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and attended the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/11338a.htm">Osimo</a>, later taking courses of canon law at Bologna and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he associated himself with his teacher <a href="../cathen/04768b.htm">Devoti</a>, assisted him in the compilation of his "Institutiones" (1792), and, when <a href="../cathen/04768b.htm">Devoti</a> was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01448a.htm">Anagni</a>, became his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>. He subsequently filled the same position under Bishop Severoli at Cingoli, and, after some time, became <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> in his native city. In 1800 <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> named him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10516a.htm">Montalto</a>, which see he shortly afterwards exchanged for that of <a href="../cathen/03546b.htm">Cesena</a>. Under the French domination he was arrested, having refused to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance to the King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and brought to <a href="../cathen/09492a.htm">Macerata</a>, then to <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, and finally to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. In 1816 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> conferred upon him the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat, and in 1822 appointed him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06243a.htm">Frascati</a> and Grand Penitentiary. As early as the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> of 1823, Castiglione was among the candidates for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. At the election of 1829, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> were desirous of electing a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of mild and temperate disposition, and Castiglione, whose character corresponded with the requirements, was chosen after a five weeks' session. His reign, which lasted but twenty months, was not wanting in notable occurrences. In April, 1829, the Catholic Emancipation Bill, which made it possible for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> to sit in Parliament and to hold public offices, was passed in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. <a href="../cathen/09167a.htm">Leo XII</a> had taken a great interest in Catholic Emancipation, but had not lived to see it become law. On 25 March, 1830, Pius published the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Litteris altero abhinc", in which he declared that marriage could be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> only when the proper promises were made regarding the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the children; otherwise, the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should only assist passively at the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. Under his successor this matter became a cause of conflict in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the Government (see <a href="../cathen/05161b.htm">CLEMENS AUGUST VON DROSTE-VISCHERING</a>). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> last months were troubled. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, the Revolution of July broke out and the king was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to flee, being succeeded on the throne by the younger Orl&eacute;ans branch. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> recognized the new regime with hesitation. The movement, which also affected <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, even extended to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where a lodge of <a href="../cathen/03330c.htm">Carbonari</a> with twenty-six members was discovered. In the midst of anxiety and care, Pius VIII, whose constitution had always been delicate, passed away. Before the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of his successor, revolution broke out in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>. The character of Pius VIII was mild and amiable, and he enjoyed a reputation for learning, being especially versed in canon law, <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">numismatics</a>, and Biblical literature. In addition, he was extremely conscientious. Thus, he ordered all his relatives, upon his accession to the pontifical throne, to resign the positions which they held.
