<h1>Pope Sabinianus</h1>  

<p>The date of his birth is unknown, but he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> probably 13 Sept., 604, and died 22 Feb., 606. The son of Bonus, he was born at Blera (Bieda) near <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>. In 593 he was sent by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory I</a> as <em>apocrisiarius</em> or <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">Apostolic nuncio</a> to Constantinople; but in some respects his administration of the office did not come up to <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory's</a> expectations. He was not astute enough for the rulers of Byzantium. He returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 597, and was chosen to succeed <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a> soon after the death of that great pontiff; but as the imperial confirmation of his election did not arrive for some months, he was not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> till September. The difficulties of his pontificate were <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by fear of the <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombards</a> and by famine. When the Lombard danger had passed, Sabinianus opened the granaries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and sold corn to the people at one <em>solidus</em> (twelve shillings) for thirty pecks. Because he was unable or unwilling to allow the people to have the corn for little or nothing, there grew up in later times a number of idle legends in which his predecessor was represented punishing him for <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>. He is reputed to have restored to the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> posts which <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> had filled with <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>.
