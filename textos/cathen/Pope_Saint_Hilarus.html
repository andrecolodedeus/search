<h1>Pope Saint Hilarus</h1>  

<p>[<em>Also spelled</em> HILARIUS]

<p>Elected 461; the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death is given as 28 Feb., 468. After the death of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a>, an <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> named Hilarus, a native of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, was chosen to succeed him, and in all probability received <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> on 19 November, 461. Together with Julius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Puteoli, Hilarus acted as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a> at the "Robber Synod" of Ephesus in 449. There he fought vigorously for the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> and opposed the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian of Constantinople</a> (see <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">SAINT FLAVIAN</a>). He was therefore exposed to the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscurus of Alexandria</a>, and saved himself by flight. In one of his letters to the Empress Pulcheria, found in a collection of letters of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a> ("Leonis I Epistolae", num. xlvi., in P.L., LIV, 837 sq.), Hilarus apologizes for not delivering to her the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> letter after the synod; but owing to <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscurus</a>, who tried to hinder his going either to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> or to Constantinople, he had great difficulty in making his escape in order to bring to the pontiff the news of the result of the council. His pontificate was marked by the same vigorous policy as that of his great predecessor. Church affairs in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> claimed his special attention. Owing to political disorganization in both countries, it was important to safeguard the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> by strengthening church government. Hermes, a former <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of Narbonne, had illegally acquired the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of that town. Two Gallican <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> were dispatched to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to lay before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> this and other matters concerning the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>. A Roman <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held on 19 November, 462, passed judgment upon these matters, and Hilarus made known the following decisions in an <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> sent to the provincial <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Vienne, <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, Narbonne, and the Alps: Hermes was to remain Titular <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Narbonne, but his episcopal faculties were withheld. A synod was to be convened yearly by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles, for those of the provincial <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were able to attend; but all important matters were to be submitted to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. No <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> could leave his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> without a written permission from the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>; in case such permission be withheld he could appeal to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles. Respecting the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> (<em>paroeciae</em>) claimed by Leontius of Arles as belonging to his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, the Gallican <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> could decide, after an investigation. <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">Church property</a> could not be alienated until a synod had examined into the cause of sale.

<p>Shortly after this the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> found himself involved in another <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> quarrel. In 463 Mamertus of Vienne had <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Die, although this Church, by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a>, belonged to the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> Diocese of Arles. When Hilarus heard of it he deputed Leontius of Arles to summon a great synod of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of several provinces to investigate the matter. The synod took place and, on the strength of the report given him by Bishop Antonius, he issued an edict <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 25 February, 464, in which Bishop Veranus was commissioned to warn Mamertus that, if in the future he did not refrain from irregular ordinations, his faculties would be withdrawn. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Die must be sanctioned by Leontius of Arles. Thus the <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> privileges of the See of Arles were upheld as <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a> had defined them. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were admonished not to overstep their boundaries, and to assemble in a yearly synod presided over by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles. The <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the See of Embrun also over the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of the Maritime Alps were protected against the encroachments of a certain Bishop Auxanius, particularly in connection with the two Churches of <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Nice</a> and Cimiez.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, Silvanus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Calahorra, had, by his episcopal ordinations, violated the church <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Both the Metropolitan Ascanius and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Province of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a> made complaint of this to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and asked for his decision. Before an answer came to their petition, the same <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had recourse to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for an entirely different matter. Before his death Nundinarius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02288e.htm">Barcelona</a>, expressed a wish that <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> might be chosen his successor, although he had himself made <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of another see. The request was granted, a Synod of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a> confirming the <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, after which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> sought the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> approval. The Roman synod of 19 Nov., 465, took the matters up and settled them. This is the oldest Roman synod whose original records have been handed down to us. It was held in the basilica of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Maggiore. After an address of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and the reading of the Spanish letters, the synod decided that the church <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> must not be tampered with. In addition to this Hilarus sent a letter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, declaring that no <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> was valid without the sanction of the Metropolitan Ascanius; and no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was permitted to be transferred from one diocese to another, so that some one else must be chosen for Barcelona in place of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Silvanus would be recognized if they had been appointed to vacant sees, and otherwise met the requirements of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> mentions an <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> that Hilarus sent to the East, to confirm the Oecumenical Councils of Nicaea, Ephesus, and Chalcedon, and the dogmatic letter of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a> to <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a>, but the sources at our disposal furnish us no further information. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Hilarus worked <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> for the integrity of the Faith. The Emperor Anthemius had a favourite named Philotheus, who was a believer in the Macedonian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and attended meetings in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, 476. On one of the emperor's visits to St. Peter's, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> openly called him to account for his favourite's conduct, exhorting him by the grave of St. Peter to promise that he would do all in his power to check the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Hilarus erected several churches and other buildings in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Two <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> of the Lateran, one in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. John the Baptist, the other of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Apostle</a>, are due to him. After his flight from the "Robber Synod" of Ephesus, Hilarus had hidden himself in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Apostle</a>, and he attributed his deliverance to the intercession of the Apostle. Over the ancient doors of the oratory this inscription is still to be seen: "To <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a>, the liberator of Bishop Hilarus, a Servant of Christ". He also erected a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Holy Cross in the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a>, a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, two public baths, and <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> near the Church of St. Laurence Outside the Walls. He built another <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> within the city walls. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> mentions many votive offerings made by Hilarus in the different churches. He died after a pontificate of six years, three months, and ten days. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Laurence Outside the Walls. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> is celebrated on 17 November.
