<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope Sergius II</h1>  

<p>Date of birth unknown; <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 844, apparently in January; d. 27 Jan., 847. He was of noble birth, and belonged to a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> which gave two other <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">Educated</a> in the <em>schola cantorum</em>, he was patronized by several <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Sts. Martin and Sylvester by Paschal. Under <a href="../cathen/06789b.htm">Gregory IV</a>, whom he succeeded, he became <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a>. At a preliminary meeting to designate a successor to <a href="../cathen/06789b.htm">Gregory</a>, the name of Sergius was accepted by the majority; but a mob endeavoured by force to place a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, John, upon the pontifical throne. He was, however, shut up in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and Sergius was duly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. From one obviously very partial edition of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> it would appear that Sergius, owing to devotion to the pleasures of the table, had no taste for business, and entrusted the management of affairs to his brother Benedict; and that, owing to attacks of gout, he was helpless in body and irritable in mind. His brother usurped all power, and made the getting of money his one concern. As all this is in sharp contrast with the character given to Sergius by the other editions of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about its gross exaggeration. As Sergius was, after a disputed election, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> without any reference to the Emperor Lothaire, the latter was indignant, and sent his son Louis with an army to examine into the validity of the election. But Sergius succeeded in pacifying Louis, whom he <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> king, but to whom he would not take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of fealty. He also made the king's adviser, Drogo, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> for <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (844). Before he died he witnessed a terrible raid of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> on the Roman territory (846), which nearly resulted in the capture of the City. Despite the resistance of the scholae of the foreigners at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the pirates sacked the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> of St. Peter and <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul</a>, and were only prevented by its strong walls from plundering <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself. Churches, aqueducts, and the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a> were improved by Sergius, who, on his death, was buried in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>.
