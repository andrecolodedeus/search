<h1>Pope Sergius III</h1>  

<p>Date of birth unknown; <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 29 Jan., 904; d. 14 April, 911. He was a Roman of noble birth and the son of Benedict. He became a strong upholder of the party opposed to <a href="../cathen/06139b.htm">Pope Formosus</a>; as this party was not ultimately successful, the writings of its supporters, if they ever existed, have perished. Hence, unfortunately, most of our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Sergius is derived from his opponents. Thus it is by an enemy that we are told that Sergius was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Caere by Formosus in order that he might never become <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>. However, he seems to have ceased to act as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> after the death of Formosus, and was put forward as a candidate for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> in 898. Failing to secure election, he retired, apparently to Alberic, Count of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>. Disgusted at the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> usurpation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne by Christopher, the Romans threw him into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and invited Sergius to take his place. Sergius at once declared the ordinations conferred by Formosus null; but that he put his two predecessors to death, and by illicit relations with Marozia had a son, who was afterwards <a href="../cathen/08426a.htm">John XI</a>, must be regarded as highly <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. These assertions are only made by bitter or ill-informed adversaries, and are inconsistent with what is said of him by respectable contemporaries. He protected Archbishop John of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> against the Count of Istria, and confirmed the establishment of a number of new sees in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Because he opposed the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the Greeks, they struck his name from the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>, but he showed his good sense in declaring valid the fourth marriage of the Greek emperor, Leo VI. Sergius completely restored the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a>, but he was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>.
