<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope St. Boniface I</h1>  

<p>Elected 28 December, 418; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 4 September, 422. Little is known of his life antecedent to his election. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> calls him a Roman, and the son of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Jocundus. He is believed to have been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Pope Damasus I (366-384) and to have served as representative of <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a> at Constantinople (c. 405).

<p>At he death of <a href="../cathen/15764c.htm">Pope Zosimus</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> entered into the fifth of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schisms</a>, resulting from double papal elections, which so disturbed her peace during the early centuries. Just after Zosimus's obsequies, 27 December, 418, a faction of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> consisting principally of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> seized the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran basilica</a> and elected as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the Archdeacon Eulalius. The higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> tried to enter, but were <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violently</a> repulsed by a mob of adherents of the Eulalian party. On the following day they met in the church of Theodora and elected as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, much against his will, the aged Boniface, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> highly esteemed for his charity, learning, and good character. On Sunday, 29 December, both were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, Boniface in the Basilica of St. Marcellus, supported by nine provincial <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and some seventy priests; Eulalius in the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran basilica</a> in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, a few <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a>, who was summoned from his sickbed to assist at the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>. Each claimant proceeded to act as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was thrown into tumultuous confusion by the clash of the rival factions. The Prefect of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Symmachus, hostile to Boniface, reported the trouble to the <a href="../cathen/07460a.htm">Emperor Honorius</a> at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, and secured the imperial confirmation of Eulalius's election. Boniface was expelled from the city. His adherents, however, secured a hearing from the emperor who called a synod of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> to meet the rival <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and discuss the situation (February, March, 419). Unable to reach a decision, the synod made a few practical provisions pending a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> of Italian, Gaulish, and African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to be convened in May to settle the difficulty. It ordered both claimants to leave <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> until a decision was reached and forbade return under penalty of condemnation. As <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, 30 March, was approaching, Achilleus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, was deputed to conduct the paschal services in the vacant <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>. Boniface was sent, it seems, to the cemetery of <a href="../cathen/06028a.htm">St. Felicitas</a> on the Via Salaria, and Eulalius to Antium. On 18 March, Eulalius boldly returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, gathered his partisans, stirred up strife anew, and spurning the prefect's orders to leave the city, seized the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran basilica</a> on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> (29 March), determined to preside at the paschal ceremonies. The imperial troops were required to dispossess him and make it possible for Achilleus to conduct the services. The emperor was deeply indignant at these proceedings and refusing to consider again the claims of Eulalius, recognized Boniface as legitimate <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (3 April, 418). The latter re-entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 10 April and was acclaimed by the people. Eulalius was made bishop either of Nepi in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> or of some Campanian see, according to the conflicting data of the sources of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> had lasted fifteen weeks. Early in 420, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> critical illness encouraged the artisans of Eulalius to make another effort. On his recovery Boniface requested the emperor (1 July, 420) to make some provision against possible renewal of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in the event of his death. Honorius enacted a law providing that, in contested Papal elections, neither claimant should be recognized and a new election should be held.

<p>Boniface's reign was marked by great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and activity in disciplinary organization and control. He reversed his predecessor's policy of endowing certain Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> with extraordinary <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> vicariate powers. Zosimus had given to Patroclus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles, extensive <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the provinces of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and Narbonne, and had made him an intermediary between these provinces and the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. Boniface diminished these <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primatial</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and restored the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> powers of the chief <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of provinces. Thus he sustained Hilary, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Narbonne, in his choice of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the vacant See of Lodeve, against Patroclus, who tried to intrude another (422). So, too, he insisted that Maximus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a>, should be tried for his alleged crimes, not by a <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>, but by a synod of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gaul, and promised to sustain their decision (419). Boniface succeeded to Zosimus's difficulties with the African Church regarding appeals to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and, in particular, the case of Apiarius. The <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Council of Carthage</a>, having heard the representations of Zosimus's <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, sent to Boniface on 31 May, 419, a letter in reply to the <em>commonitorium</em> of his predecessor. It stated that the council had been unable to verify the canons which the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> had quoted as Nicene, but which were later found to be Sardican. It agreed, however, to observe them until verification could be established. This letter is often cited in illustration of the defiant attitude of the African Church to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>. An unbiased study of it, however, must lead to no more extreme conclusion than that of Dom Chapman: "it was written in considerable irritation, yet in a studiously moderate tone" (Dublin Review. July, 1901, 109-119). The Africans were irritated at the insolence of Boniface's <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> and incensed at being urged to obey <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which they thought were not consistently enforced at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. This they told Boniface in no uncertain language; yet, far from repudiating his authority, they promised to obey the suspected <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> thus recognizing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> office as guardian of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> discipline. In 422 Boniface received the appeal of Anthony of Fussula who, through the efforts of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, had been deposed by a provincial synod of Numidia, and decided that he should be restored if his innocence be established. Boniface ardently supported St. Augustine in combating <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a>. Having received two <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> letters <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniating</a> Augustine, he sent them to him. In recognition of this solicitude Augustine dedicated to Boniface his rejoinder contained in "Contra duas Epistolas Pelagianoruin Libri quatuor".

<p>In the East he <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> maintained his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the ecclesiastical provinces of Illyricurn, of which the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople was trying to secure control on account of their becoming a part of the Eastern empire. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a> had been constituted <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> vicar in this territory, exercising <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. By letters to Rufus, the contemporary incumbent of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, Boniface watched closely over the interests of the Illyrian church and insisted on obedience to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 421 dissatisfaction expressed by certain malcontents among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, on account of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> refusal to confirm the election of Perigines as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> unless the candidate was recognized by Rufus, served as a pretext for the young emperor Theodosius II to grant the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> dominion of Illyricurn to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople (14 July, 421). Boniface remonstrated with Honorius against the violation of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and prevailed upon him to urge Theodosius to rescind his enactment. The law was not enforced, but it remained in the Theodosian (439) and Justinian (534) codes and caused much trouble for succeeding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. By a letter of 11 March, 422, Boniface forbade the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> in Illyricum of any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whom Rufus would not recognize. Boniface renewed the legislation of Pope Soter, prohibiting <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to touch the sacred linens or to minister at the burning of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>. He enforced the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> forbidding slaves to become <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the cemetery of Maximus on the Via Salaria, near the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of his favorite, <a href="../cathen/06028a.htm">St. Felicitas</a>, in whose honor and in gratitude for whose aid he had erected an oratory over the cemetery bearing her name. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> keeps his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> on 25 October.
