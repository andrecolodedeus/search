<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope St. Boniface IV</h1>  

<p>Son of John, a physician, a Marsian from the province and town of Valeria; he succeeded Boniface III after a <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacancy</a> of over nine months; <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 25 August, 608; d. 8 May, 615 (Duchesne); or, 15 September, 608-25 May, 615 (Jaff&eacute;). In the time of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope St. Gregory the Great</a> he was a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and held the position of <em>dispensator,</em> i.e., the first official in connexion with the administration of the patrimonies. Boniface obtained leave from the Emperor Phocas to convert the Pantheon into a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Church, and on 13 May, 609 (?) the temple erected by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm#IV">Agrippa</a> to Jupiter the Avenger, to Venus, and to Mars was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a> and all the Martyrs. (Hence the title S. Maria Rotunda.) It was the first instance at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of the transformation of a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> temple into a place of <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Christian worship</a>. Twenty-eight cartloads of sacred bones were said to have been removed from the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacombs</a> and placed in a porphyry basin beneath the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a>. During the pontificate of Boniface, <a href="../cathen/10168b.htm">Mellitus</a>, the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09341a.htm">London</a>, went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> "to consult the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on important matters relative to the newly established English Church" (Bede, H. E., II, iv). Whilst in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he assisted at a council then being held concerning certain questions on "the life and monastic peace of monks", and, on his departure, took with him to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the council together with letters from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to Lawrence, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, and to all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, to King Ethelbert, and to all the English people "concerning what was to be observed by the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a>". The decrees of the council now extant are spurious. The letter to Ethelbert (in <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a>, De Gest. Pont., I, 1464, ed <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>) is considered spurious by Hefele (Conciliengeschichte, III, 66), questionable by Haddan and Stubbs (Councils, III, 65), and genuine by Jaff&eacute; [Regest. RR. PP., 1988 (1548)].

<p>Between 612-615, St. Columban, then living at <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, was persuaded by Agilulf, King of the Lombards, to address a letter on the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">"Three Chapters"</a> to Boniface IV, which is remarkable at once for its expressions of exaggerated deference and its tone of excessive sharpness. In it he tells the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> that he is charged with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> (for accepting the Fifth Council, i.e. Constantinople, 553), and exhorts him to summon a council and prove his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. But the letter of the impetuous Celt, who failed to grasp the import of the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> problem involved in the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">"Three Chapters"</a>, seems not to have disturbed in the least his relation with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and it would be wrong to suppose that Columban regarded himself as independent of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> authority. During the pontificate of Boniface there was much distress in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> owing to famine, pestilence, and inundations. The pontiff died in monastic retirement (he had converted his own house into a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>) and was buried in the portico of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. His remains were three times removed&mdash;in the tenth or eleventh century, at the close of the thirteenth under Boniface VIII, and to the new St. Peter's on 21 October, 1603. For the earlier inscription on his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> see Duchesne; for the later, Groisar, "Analecta Romana", I, 193. Boniface IV is commemorated as a saint in the Roman Martyrology on 25 May.
