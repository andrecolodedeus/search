<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope St. Celestine I</h1>  

<p>Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of his early history except that he was a Roman and that his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> name was Priscus. He is said to have lived for a time at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> with <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>; the first notice, however, concerning him that is known is in a document of St. Innocent I, in the year 416, where he is spoken of as Celestine the Deacon. In 418 <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> wrote to him (Epist., lxii) in very reverential language. He succeeded St. Boniface I as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, 10 Sept., 422 (according to <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Tillemont</a>, though the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a> say 3 Nov.), and died 26 July, 432, having reigned nine years, ten months, and sixteen days. In spite of the troublous times at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he was elected without any opposition, as is learned from a letter of St. Augustine (Epist., cclxi), written to him shortly after his elevation, in which the great doctor begs his assistance in composing his difficulties with Antonius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Fessula in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. A strong friendship seems to have existed between Celestine and Augustine, and after the death of the latter in 430, Celestine wrote a long letter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gaul on the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, learning and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the holy doctor, and forbade all attacks upon his memory on the part of the Semipelagians, who under the leadership of the famous ascetic, John Cassian, were then beginning to gain influence. Though his lot was cast in stormy times, for the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, Noviatians, and <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> were troubling the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, while the barbarian hordes were beginning their inroads into the heart of the empire, Celestine's firm but gentle character enabled him to meet successfully all the exigencies of his position. We see him everywhere upholding the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the dignity of his office. In this he was aided by Placidia, who, in the name of her youthful son, <a href="../cathen/15255b.htm">Valentinian III</a>, banished from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> and other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who were disturbing the peace. Celestine not only excluded Coelestius, the companion and chief disciple of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>, from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but procured the further condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> from the Council of Ephesus, while through his instrumentality <a href="../cathen/06472b.htm">St. Germanus of Auxerre</a> and St. Lupus of <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, who had been sent to Britain in 429, the native land of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>, by the Gallic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, succeeded in extirpating the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> from its native soil.

<p>A firm upholder of the ancient canons, we find Celestine writing to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a>, bidding them observe the canons and their old allegiance to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> vicar, without whom they are not to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or hold any council. He also writes to the Bishops of Vienne and Narbonne, whom he warns to keep the ancient canons, and, in accordance with the warning of his predecessor, to resist the pretensions of the See of Arles. Moreover they must not refuse to admit to penance those who desire it at the moment of death; <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, too, must not dress as <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and severe action is to be taken against a certain Daniel, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> from the Orient who had been the cause of serious disorders in the <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Church of Gaul</a>. To the Bishops of Apulia and Calabria he writes that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> must not remain <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the canons, neither are the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> to be advanced to the episcopate over the heads of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, nor is the popular will, no matter how strong, to be humoured in this matter &#151; <em>populus docendus non sequendus</em>. Moreover he threatens severe penalties for future transgressors. In upholding the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> to hear and decide appeals from all quarters, he came for a time into conflict with the great Church of Africa (see Apiarius). The African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, however, through manifesting some warmth, never called into question the Divine supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, their very language and actions expressed its fullest recognition; their complaints were directed rather against the sometimes indiscreet use of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> prerogative. The last years of the pontificate of Celestine were taken up with the struggle in the East over the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Nestorius (see Nestorius; <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">Cyril of Alexandria</a>; Ephesus, Council of). Nestorius who had become <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople in 428 at first gave great satisfaction, as we learn from a letter addressed to him by Celestine. He soon aroused suspicions of his <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> by receiving kindly the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> banished from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and shortly after, rumours of his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teaching concerning the twofold <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> of Christ reaching <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Celestine commissioned Cyril, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, to investigate and make a report. Cyril having found Nestorius openly professing his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> sent a full account to Celestine, who in a Roman synod (430), having solemnly condemned the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Nestorius, now ordered Cyril in his name to proceed against Nestorius, who was to be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and deposed unless within ten days he should have made in writing a solemn retractation of his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. In letters written the same day to Nestorius, to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people of Constantinople, and to <a href="../cathen/08468a.htm">John of Antioch</a>, Juvenal of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, Rufus of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, and Flavian of <a href="../cathen/12007c.htm">Philippi</a>, Celestine announces the sentence passed upon Nestorius and the commission given to Cyril to execute it. At the same time he restored all who had been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> or deprived by Nestorius. Cyril forwarded the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sentence and his own <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> to Nestorius. The emperor now summoned a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> to meet at Ephesus. To this council Celestine sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, Arcadius, and Projectus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and Philippus, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who were to act in conjunction with Cyril. However, they were not to mix in discussion but were to judge the opinions of the others. Celestine in all his letters assumes his own decision as final, Cyril and the council, "compelled by the sacred canons and the letters of Our Most Holy Father, Celestine, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>."

<p>The last official act of Celestine, the sending of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> to <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, perhaps surpasses all the rest in its far-reaching consequences for good. He had already sent (431) <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the "Scots [i.e. <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a>] <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> in Christ." But <a href="../cathen/11425a.htm">Palladius</a> son abandoned <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and died the year following in Britain. <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a>, who had previously been refused, now received the long-coveted commission only a few days before the death of Celestine, who thus becomes a sharer in the conversion of the race that in the next few centuries was to accomplish such vast works by its countless missionaries and scholars in the conversion and civilization of the barbarian world. In the local affairs of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, Celestine manifested great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. He restored and embellished the church of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> in Trastevere, which had suffered from the Gothic pillage of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, also the church of <a href="../cathen/13290a.htm">St. Sabina</a>, besides decorating the Cemetery of St. Priscilla with <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> of the Council Ephesus. The precise <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death is uncertain. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is kept in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> on 6 April, the day on which his body was placed in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacombs</a> of St. Priscilla whence it was transferred in 820 by Pope St. Paschal I to the church of Sta Prassede, though the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a> likewise claims his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a> where he is highly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> for his condemnation of Nestorius, his feast falls on 8 April.

<p>The extant writings of St. Celestine consist of sixteen letters, the contents of many of which have been indicated above, and a fragment of a discourse on <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a> delivered in the Roman Synod of 430. The "Capitula Coelestini", the ten decisions on the subject of grace which have played such a part in the history of <a href="../cathen/02091a.htm">Augustinianism</a>, are no longer attributed to his authorship. For centuries they were affixed as an integral part to his letter to the Bishops of Gaul, but at present are considered as most probably the work of <a href="../cathen/12487a.htm">St. Prosper of Aquitaine</a>. Anastasius Bibliothecarius attributes to him several other constitutions but with little authority. Doubtful also is the statement of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> that Celestine added the <a href="../cathen/08081a.htm">Introit</a> to the Mass.
