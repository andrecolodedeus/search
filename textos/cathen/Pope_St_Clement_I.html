<h1>Pope St. Clement I</h1>  

<p>Pope Clement I (called CLEMENS ROMANUS to distinguish him from the <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Alexandrian</a>), is the first of the successors of St. Peter of whom anything definite is known, and he is the first of the "Apostolic Fathers". His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated 23 November. He has left one genuine writing, a letter to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, and many others have been attributed to him.
<h2 id="section1">The fourth pope</h2>

<p>According to <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, writing c. 199, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> claimed that Clement was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by St. Peter (De Praescript., xxxii), and <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> tells us that in his time "most of the Latins" held that Clement was the immediate successor of the Apostle (<a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 15</a>). <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> himself in several other places follows this opinion, but here he correctly states that Clement was the fourth <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The early evidence shows great variety. The most ancient list of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> is one made by Hegesippus in the time of Pope Anicetus, c. 160 (Harnack ascribes it to an unknown author under Soter, c. 170), cited by <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> (Haer., xxvii, 6). It seems to have been used by St. Iren&aelig;us (Haer., III, iii), by <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Julius Africanus</a>, who composed a chronography in 222, by the third- or fourth-century author of a Latin poem against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, who see <a href="../cathen/03738a.htm">chronology</a> extends to 234 and is probably found in the "Liberian Catalogue" of 354. That catalogue was itself adopted in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05616a.htm">chronicle</a> and history used Africanus; in the latter he slightly corrected the dates. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome's</a> chronicle is a translation of <a href="../cathen/05616a.htm">Eusebius's</a>, and is our principal means for restoring the lost Greek of the latter; the <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> version and Coptic epitomes of it are not to be depended on. The varieties of order are as follows: <ol> <LI><a href="../cathen/09272b.htm">Linus</a>, Cletus, Clemens (Hegesippus, ap. Epiphanium, Canon of Mass). <br><a href="../cathen/09272b.htm">Linus</a>, Anencletus, Clemens (Irenaeus, Africanus ap. Eusebium). <br><a href="../cathen/09272b.htm">Linus</a>, Anacletus, Clemens (Jerome). <LI><a href="../cathen/09272b.htm">Linus</a>, Cletus, Anacletus, Clemens (Poem against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>), <LI><a href="../cathen/09272b.htm">Linus</a>, Clemens, Cletus, Anacletus [<a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> (?), "Liberian Catal."- "Liber. Pont."]. <LI><a href="../cathen/09272b.htm">Linus</a>, Clemens, Anacletus (Optatus, Augustine). </ol>

<p>At the present time no critic <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> that Cletus, Anacletus, Anencletus, are the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Anacletus is a Latin <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; Cletus is a shortened (and more <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>) form of Anencletus. Lightfoot thought that the transposition of Clement in the "Liberian Catalogue" was a mere accident, like the similar <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> "Anicetus, Pius" for "Pius Anicetus", further on in the same list. But it may have been a deliberate alteration by <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, on the ground of the tradition mentioned by <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>. St. Iren&aelig;us (III, iii) tells us that Clement "saw the blessed Apostles and conversed with them, and had yet ringing in his ears the preaching of the Apostles and had their tradition before his eyes, and not he only for many were then surviving who had been taught y the Apostles". Similarly Epiphanius tells us (from Hegesippus) that Clement was a contemporary of Peter and Paul. Now <a href="../cathen/09272b.htm">Linus</a> and Cletus had each twelve years attributed to them in the list. If <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> found Cletus doubled by an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> (Cletus XII, Anacletus XII), the accession of Clement would appear to be thirty-six years after the death of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. As this would make it almost impossible for Clement to have been their contemporary, it may have caused <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> to shift him to an earlier position. Further, <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> says (loc. cit.): "Whether he received episcopal <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> from Peter in the life-time of the Apostles, and declined the office, for he says in one of his epistles 'I retire, I depart, let the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be in peace', (for we have found this set down in certain Memoirs), or whether he was appointed by the Bishop Cletus after he had succeeded the Apostles, we do not clearly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>." The "Memoirs" were certainly those of Hegesippus. It seems unlikely that he is appealed to only for the quotation from the Epistle, c. liv; probably Epiphanius means that Hegesippus stated that Clement had been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by Peter and declined to be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but twenty-four years later really exercised the office for nine years. Epiphanius could not reconcile these two facts; <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> seems to have rejected the latter.
<h3>Chronology</h3>

<p>The date intended by Hegesippus is not hard to restore. Epiphanius implies that he placed the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the Apostles in the twelfth year of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>. Africanus calculated the fourteenth year (for he had attributed one year too little to the reigns of Caligula and Claudius), and added the imperial date for the accession of each <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; but having two years too few up to Anicetus he could not get the intervals to tally with the years of episcopate given by Hegesippus. He had a parallel difficulty in his list of the Alexandrian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.



<table summary="Table"> <TR><TH> Hegesippus<TH><TH> Africanus (from <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>)<TH><TH> Interval<TH><TH><TH>Real Dates A.D. <TR><TH> <a href="../cathen/09272b.htm">Linus</a><TH> 12<TH> <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a><TH> 14<TH> 12<TH> <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a><TH> 12<TH> 66 <TR><TH> Cletus<TH> 12<TH> Titus<TH> 2<TH> 12<TH> Vesp<TH> 10<TH> 78 <TR><TH> Clemens<TH> 9<TH> Dom<TH> 12<TH> (7)<TH> Dom<TH> 10<TH> 80 <TR><TH> Euaristus<TH> 8<TH> <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a><TH> 2<TH> (10)<TH> Trajan<TH> 2<TH> 99 <TR><TH> Alexander<TH> 10<TH> <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a><TH> 12<TH> 10<TH> <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a><TH> 10<TH> 107 <TR><TH> <a href="../cathen/14031b.htm">Sixtus</a><TH> 10<TH> Hadrian<TH> 3<TH> (9)<TH> Hadrian<TH> 1<TH> 117 <TR><TH> <a href="../cathen/14477b.htm">Telesphorus</a><TH> 11<TH> Hadrian<TH> 12<TH> (10)<TH> Hadrian<TH> 11<TH> 127 <TR><TH> Hyginus<TH> 4<TH> Anton<TH> 1<TH> 4<TH> Anton<TH> 1<TH> 138 <TR><TH> <a href="../cathen/12126b.htm">Pius</a><TH> 15<TH> Anton<TH> 5<TH> 15<TH> Anton<TH> 5<TH> 142 <TR><TH> Anicetus<TH><TH> Anton<TH><TH> 20<TH> Anton<TH> 20<TH> 157 </table>

<p>If we start, as Hegesippus intended, with <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> 12 (see last column), the sum of his years brings us right for the last three <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. But Africanus has started two years wrong, and in order to get right at Hyginus he has to allow one year too little to each of the preceding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/14031b.htm">Sixtus</a> and <a href="../cathen/14477b.htm">Telesphorus</a>. But there is one inharmonious date, <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> 2, which gives seven and ten years to Clement and Euaristus instead of nine and eight. Evidently he felt bound to insert a traditional date &#151; and in fact we see that <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> 2 was the date intended by Hegesippus. Now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Hegesippus spoke about Clement's acquaintance with the Apostles, and said nothing about any other <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> until <a href="../cathen/14477b.htm">Telesphorus</a>, "who was a glorious <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>." It is not surprising, then, to find that Africanus had, besides the lengths of episcopate, two fixed dates from Hegesippus, those of the death of Clement in the second year of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/14477b.htm">Telesphorus</a> in the first year of <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus Pius</a>. We may take it, therefore, that about 160 the death of St. Clement was believed to have been in 99.
<h3>Identity</h3>

<p><a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> identifies Pope Clement with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> fellow-labourer (<a href="../bible/phi004.htm#vrs3">Philippians 4:3</a>), and so do <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, Epiphanius, and Jerome &#151; but this Clement was probably a <a href="../cathen/12007b.htm">Philippian</a>. In the middle of the nineteenth century it was the custom to identity the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with the consul of 95, T. Flavius Clemens, who was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> by his first cousin, the <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Emperor Domitian</a>, at the end of his consulship. But the ancients never suggest this, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is said to have lived on till the reign of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>. It is unlikely that he was a member of the imperial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. The continual use of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> in his Epistle has suggested to Lightfoot, Funk, Nestle, and others that he was of Jewish origin. Probably he was a freedman or son of a freedman of the emperor's household, which included thousands or tens of thousands. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the household of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> (<a href="../bible/phi004.htm#vrs22">Philippians 4:22</a>). It is highly probable that the bearers of Clement's letter, Claudius Ephebus and Valerius Vito, were of this number, for the names Claudius and Valerius occur with great frequency in inscriptions among the freedmen of the Emperor Claudius (and his two predecessors of the same gens) and his wife Valeria Messalina. The two messengers are described as "faithful and prudent men, who have walked among us from youth unto old age unblameably", thus they were probably already <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and living in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> before the death of the Apostles about thirty years earlier. The Prefect of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> during <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero's</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was Titus Flavius Sabinus, elder brother of the <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Emperor Vespasian</a>, and father of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> Clemens. <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">Flavia Domitilla</a>, wife of the Martyr, was a granddaughter of <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>, and niece of Titus and <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>; she may have died a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> to the rigours of her banishment The <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">Domitilla</a> is shown by existing inscriptions to have been founded by her. Whether she is distinct from another Flavia Domitilla, who is styled "Virgin and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>", is uncertain. (See <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">FLAVIA DOMITILLA</a> and <a href="../cathen/10751a.htm">NEREUS AND ACHILLEUS</a>) The consul and his wife had two sons <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> and Domitian, who had Quintilian for their tutor. Of their life nothing is known. The elder brother of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Clemens was T. Flavius Sabinus, consul in 82, <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, whose sister he had married. Pope Clement is rep resented as his son in the Acts of Sts. Nereus and Achilleus, but this would make him too young to have known the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>.
<h3>Martyrdom</h3>

<p>Of the life and death of St, Clement nothing is known. The <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> Greek Acts of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> were printed by Cotelier in his "Patres Apost." (1724, I, 808; reprinted in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., II, 617, best edition by Funk, "Patr. Apost.", II, 28). They relate how he converted Theodora, wife of Sisinnius, a courtier of Nerva, and (after <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>) Sisinnius himself and four hundred and twenty-three other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of rank. <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> banishes the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to the Crimea, where he slakes the thirst of two thousand <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> confessors by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. The people of the country are converted, seventy-five churches are built. <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, in consequence, orders Clement to be thrown into the sea with an iron anchor. But the tide every year recedes two miles, revealing a Divinely built shrine which contains the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> bones. This story is not older than the fourth century. It is known to <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> in the sixth. About 868 St. Cyril, when in the Crimea on the way to evangelize the Chazars, dug up some bones in a mound (not in a <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> under the sea), and also an anchor. These were believed to be the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Clement. They were carried by St. Cyril to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and deposited by <a href="../cathen/01156a.htm">Adrian II</a> with those of <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">St. Ignatius of Antioch</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> of the basilica of St. Clement in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The history of this translation is evidently quite truthful, but there seems to have been no tradition with regard to the mound, which simply looked a likely place to be a <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>. The anchor appears to be the only evidence of identity but we cannot gather from the account that it belonged to the scattered bones. (See Acta SS., 9 March, II, 20.) St. Clement is first mentioned as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> by Rufinus (c. 400). Pope Zozimus in a letter to Africa in 417 relates the trial and partial acquittal of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> Caelestius in the basilica of St. Clement; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had chosen this church because Clement had learned the Faith from St. Peter, and had given his life for it (Ep. ii). He is also called a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> by the writer known as Praedestinatus (c. 430) and by the Synod of <a href="../cathen/16078b.htm">Vaison</a> in 442. Modern critics think it possible that his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> was suggested by a confusion with his namesake, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> consul. But the lack of tradition that he was buried in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is in favour of his having died in exile.
<h3>The basilica</h3>

<p>The church of St. Clement at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> lies in the valley between the Esquiline and Coelian hills, on the direct road from the Coliseum to the Lateran. It is now in the hands of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Province of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>. With its atrium, its choir enclosed by a wall, its <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambos</a>, it is the most perfect model of an early basilica in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, though it was built as late as the first years of the twelfth century by Paschal II, after the destruction of this portion of the city by the Normans under <a href="../cathen/07072b.htm">Robert Guiscard</a>. Paschal II followed the lines of an earlier church, on a rather smaller scale, and employed some of its materials and fittings The marble wall of the present choir is of the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of <a href="../cathen/08421b.htm">John II</a> (533-5). In 1858 the older church was unearthed, below the present building, by the Prior Father Mulooly, O.P. Still lower were found chambers of imperial date and walls of the Republican period. The <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">lower church</a> was built under Constantine (d. 337) or not much later. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> implies that it was not new in his time: "nominis eius [Clementis] memoriam usque hodie Romae exstructa ecclesia custodit" (<a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 15</a>). It is mentioned in inscriptions of Damasus (d. 383) and Siricius (d. 398). <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> thought the lowest chambers belonged to the house of Clement, and that the room immediately under the altar was probably the original <em>memoria</em> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>. These chambers communicate with a shrine of <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithras</a>, which lies beyond the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of the church, on the lowest level. <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> supposed this to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> purposely polluted by the authorities during the last <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Lightfoot has suggested that the rooms may have belonged to the house of T. Flavius Clemens the consul, being later mistaken for the dwelling of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; but this seems quite gratuitous. In the sanctuary of <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithras</a> a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of the Good Shepherd was found.
<h2 id="section2">Pseudo-Clementine writings</h2>

<p>Many writings have been falsely attributed to Pope St. Clement I:<ol><li>The "Second Clementine Epistle to the Corinthians", discussed under III. <li>Two "Epistles to Virgins", extant in Syriac in an Amsterdam <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of 1470. The Greek originals are lost. Many critics have believed them genuine, for they were known in the fourth century to <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a> (who speaks of their being read in the Churches) and to <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>. But it is now admitted on all hands that they cannot be by the same author as the genuine Epistle to the Corinthians. Some writers, as Hefele and Westcott, have attributed them to the second half of the second century, but the third is more probable (Harnack, Lightfoot). Harnack thinks the two letters were originally one. They were first edited by Wetstein, 1470, with Latin translation, reprinted by <a href="../cathen/06349c.htm">Gallandi</a>, "Bibl. vett. Patr.", I, and <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.G., I. They are found in Latin only in <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Concilia", I, and Funk "Patres Apost.", II.

<h2 id="section3">The Epistle to the Corinthians</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> had been led by a few violent spirits into a sedition against its rulers. No appeal seems to have been made to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but a letter was sent in the name of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by St. Clement to restore peace and unity. He begins by explaining that his delay in writing has been caused by the sudden calamities which, one after another, had just been falling upon the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. The reference is clearly to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>. The former high reputation of the Corinthian Church is recalled, its <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and hospitality, its obedience and discipline. Jealousy had caused the divisions; it was jealousy that led Cain, Esau, etc., into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it was jealousy to which Peter and Paul and multitudes with them fell victims. The Corinthians are urged to repent after the example of the Patriarchs, and to be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> like Christ himself. Let them observe order, as all creation does. A curious passage on the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> is somewhat of an interruption in the sequence: all creation proves the Resurrection, and so does the phoenix, which every five hundred years consumes itself, that its offspring may arise out of its ashes (23-6). Let us, Clement continues, forsake <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and approach <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with purity, clinging to His blessing, which the Patriarchs so richly obtained, for the Lord will quickly come with His rewards, let us look to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, our <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High-Priest</a>, above the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> at the right hand of the Father (36). Discipline and subordination are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> as in an army and in the human body, while arrogance is absurd for man is nothing. The Apostles foresaw feuds, and provided for a succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>; such, therefore cannot be removed at pleasure. The just have always been <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. Read <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> first epistle to you, how he condemns party spirit. It is shocking that a few should disgrace the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>. Let us beg for pardon; nothing is more beautiful than charity; it was shown by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> when He gave His Flesh for our flesh, His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">Soul</a> for our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; by living in this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, we shall be in the number of the saved through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, by Whom is glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for ever and ever, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> (58). But if any disobey, he is in great danger; but we will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that the Creator may preserve the number of His elect in the whole world.--Here follows a beautiful Eucharistic <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (59-61). The conclusion follows: "We have said enough, on the necessity of repentance, unity, peace, for we have been speaking to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, who have deeply studied the Scriptures, and will understand the examples pointed out, and will follow them. We shall indeed be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> if you obey. We have sent two venerable messengers, to show how great is our anxiety for peace among you" (62-4). "Finally may the all-seeing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Master of Spirits and Lord of all flesh, who chose the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> and us through Him for a peculiar people, grant unto every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is called after His excellent and holy Name <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, fear, peace, patience, long-suffering, temperance, chastity, and soberness, that they may be well-pleasing unto His Name through our <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High Priest</a> and Guardian. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, through whom unto Him be glory and majesty, might and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, both now and for ever and ever, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. Now send ye back speedily unto us our messengers Claudius Ephebus and Valerius Bito, together with Fortunatus also, in peace and with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, to the end that they may the more quickly report the peace and concord which is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for and earnestly desired by us, that we also may the more speedily rejoice over your good order. The grace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> be with you and with all men in all places who have been called by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and through Him, through whom is glory and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, power and greatness and eternal dominion, unto Him, from the ages past and for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>." (64-5.)

<p>The style of the Epistle is earnest and simple, restrained and dignified, and sometimes eloquent. The Greek is correct, though not classical. The quotations from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> are long and numerous. The version of the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> used by Clement inclines in places towards that which appears in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, yet presents sufficient evidence of independence; his readings are often with A, but are less often opposed to B than are those in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>; occasionally he is found against the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> with Theodotion or even Aquila (see H. B. Swete, Introd. to the 0. T. in Greek, Cambridge 1900). The <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> he never quotes verbally. Sayings of Christ are now and then given, but not in the words of the Gospels. It cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, therefore, that he used any one of the Synoptic Gospels. He mentions <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> First Epistle to the Corinthians, and appears to imply a second. He knows Romans and Titus, and apparently cites several other of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a>. But Hebrews is most often employed of all <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> books. James, probably, and I Peter, perhaps, are referred to. (See the lists of citations in Funk and Lightfoot, Westcott, Introductions to Holy Scripture, such as those of <a href="../cathen/04378a.htm">Cornely</a>, Zahn, etc., and "The New Test. in the Apost. Fathers", by a Committee of the Oxford Society of Hist. Theology, Oxford, 1906.) The tone of authority with which the letter speaks is noteworthy, especially in the later part (56, 58, etc.): "But if certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should be disobedient unto the words spoken by Him through us let them understand that they will entangle themselves in no slight transgression and danger; but we shall be guiltless of this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (59). "It may, perhaps, seem strange", writes Bishop Lightfoot, "to describe this noble remonstrance as the first step towards <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> domination. And yet undoubtedly this is the case." (I, 70.)
<h3>Doctrine</h3>

<p>There is little intentional dogmatic teaching in the Epistle, for it is almost wholly hortatory. A passage on the <a href="../cathen/15047a.htm">Holy Trinity</a> is important. Clement uses the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> affirmation "The Lord liveth", substituting the Trinity thus: "As God liveth, and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> liveth and the Holy Spirit &#151; the faith and hope of the elect, so surely he that performeth", etc. (58). Christ is frequently represented as the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">High-Priest</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> is often referred to. Clement speaks strongly of justification by works. His words on the <a href="../cathen/07326a.htm">Christian ministry</a> have given rise to much discussion (42 and 44): "The Apostles received the Gospel for us from the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> was sent from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. So then Christ is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Apostles from Christ. Both [missions] therefore came in due order by the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>..... So preaching everywhere in country and town, they appointed their <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>, having <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> them by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> for those who should believe. And this in no new fashion, for it had indeed been written from very ancient times about <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>; for thus saith the Scripture: 'I will appoint their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and their <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>"' (a strange citation of <a href="../bible/isa060.htm#vrs17">Isaiah 60:17</a>). . . . "And our Apostles <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> that there would be strife over the name of the office of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. For this cause therefore, having received complete foreknowledge, they appointed the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and afterwards they have given a law, so that, if these should fall asleep, other approved men should succeed to their ministration." <a href="../cathen/13207a.htm">Rothe</a>, Michiels (Origines de l'episcopat, Louvain, 1900, 197), and others awkwardly understand "if they, the Apostles, should fall asleep". For <em>epinomen dedokasin</em>, which the Latin renders <em>legem dederunt</em>, Lightfoot reads <em>epimonen dedokasin</em>, "they have provided a continuance". In any case the general meaning is clear, that the Apostles provided for a lawful succession of <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>. Presbyters are mentioned several times, but are not distinguished from <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. There is absolutely no mention of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> there are always spoken of in the. plural. R. Sohm thinks there was as yet no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> when Clement wrote (so Michiels and many other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers; Lightfoot leaves the question open), but that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must have been appointed in consequence of the letter; he thinks that <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was the origin of all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> institutions and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> (Kirchenrecht 189). Harnack in 1897 (Chronol., I) upheld the paradox that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was so conservative as to be governed by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> until Anicetus; and that when the list of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> was composed, c. 170, there had been a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for less than twenty years; Clement and others in the list were only <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> of special influence.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> character of parts of the Epistle is elaborately discussed by Lightfoot. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (59-61) already mentioned, which reminds us of the <a href="../cathen/01451a.htm">Anaphora</a> of early <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, cannot be regarded, says Duchesne, "as a reproduction of a sacred formulary but it is an excellent example of the style of solemn <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> leaders of that time were accustomed to express themselves at meetings for worship" (Origines du culte chret., 3rd ed., 50; tr., 50). The fine passage about Creation, 32-3, is almost in the style of a Preface, and concludes by introducing the Sanctus by the usual mention of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic powers</a>: "Let us mark the whole host of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, how they stand by and minister unto His Will. For the Scripture saith: Ten thousand times ten thousand stood by Him, and thousands of thousands ministered unto Him, and they cried aloud: Holy holy, holy is the Lord of <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">Sabaoth</a>; all creation is full of His glory. Yea, and let us ourselves then <em>being gathered together in concord</em> with intentness of heart, cry unto Him." The combination of <a href="../bible/dan007.htm#vrs10">Daniel 7:10</a> with <a href="../bible/isa006.htm#vrs3">Isaiah 6:3</a> may be from a <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> formula. It is interesting to note that the contemporary <a href="../bible/rev004.htm#vrs8">Apocalypse of St. John 4:8</a> shows the four living creatures, representing all creation, singing the Sanctus at the heavenly Mass.

<p>The historical references in the letter are deeply interesting: "To pass from the examples of ancient days, let us come to those champions who lived very near to our time. Let us set before us the noble examples which belong to our generation. By reason of jealousy and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> the greatest and most righteous pillars of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and contended even until death. Let us set before our eyes the good Apostles. There was Peter, who by reason of unrighteous jealousy endured not one or two, but many labours, and thus having borne his testimony went to his appointed Place of glory. By reason of jealousy and strife Paul by his example pointed out the prize of patient endurance. After that he had been seven times in bonds, had been driven into exile, had been stoned, had preached in the East and in the West, he won the noble renown which was the reward of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> having taught righteousness unto the whole world and having reached the farthest bounds of the West; and when he had borne his testimony before the rulers, so he departed from the world and went unto the holy place having been found a notable pattern of patient endurance (5). It is obvious that these two Apostles are mentioned because they suffered at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It seems that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> went to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> as he intended (<a href="../bible/rom015.htm#vrs28">Romans 15:28</a>) and as is declared by the spurious Acts of Peter and by the <a href="../cathen/10642a.htm">Muratorian fragment</a>. "Unto these men of holy lives was gathered a vast multitude of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> who through many indignities and tortures, being the victims of jealousy, set a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> example among ourselves. By reason of jealousy <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> being <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, after that they had suffered cruel and unholy insults as Danaids and Dircae, safely reached the goal in the race of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and received a noble reward, feeble though they were in body" (6). The "vast multitude" both of men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> "among ourselves" at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> refers to the horrible <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, described by Tacitus, "Ann.", XV, xliv. It is in the recent past, and the writer continues: "We are in the same lists, and the same contest awaits us" (7)- he is under another <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, that of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>, covertly referred to as a series of "sudden and repeated calamities and reverses", which have prevented the letter from being written sooner. The <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the Consul Clement (probably patron of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>) and the exile of his wife will be among these disasters.
<h3>Date and authenticity</h3>

<p>The date of the letter is determined by these notices of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. It is strange that even a few good scholars (such as Grotius Grabe, <a href="../cathen/11325a.htm">Orsi</a>, Uhlhorn, Hefele, Wieseler) should have dated it soon after <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>. It is now universally acknowledged, after Lightfoot, that it was written about the last year of <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> (Harnack) or immediately after his death in 96 (Funk). <span class="stiki">In 1996, as Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, Pope Benedict XVI supported a date of A.D. 70, and by 2002 most scholars a date earlier than 96, some agreeing with the A.D. 70 date.</span> The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> had existed several decades, for the two envoys to Corinth had lived in it from youth to age. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> is called <em>archai</em> (47). Bishops and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> have succeeded to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> appointed by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> (44). Yet the time of the Apostles is "quite lately" and "our own veneration" (5). The external evidence is in accord. The dates given for Clement's episcopate by Hegesippus are apparently 90-99, and that early writer states that the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> took place under <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.16</a>, for <em>kata ton deloumenon</em> is meaningless if it is taken to refer to Clement and not to <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a>; besides, the whole of <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius's</a> account of that emperor's <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, III, xvii-xx, is founded on Hegesippus). St. Iren&aelig;us says that Clement still remembered the Apostles, and so did many others, implying an interval of many years after their death. Volkmar placed the date in the reign of Hadrian, because the Book of Judith is quoted, which he declared to have been written in that reign. He was followed by Baur, but not by Hilgenfeld. Such a date is manifestly impossible, if only because the Epistle of Polycarp is entirely modelled on that of Clement and borrows from it freely. It is possibly employed by St. Ignatius, c. 107, and certainly in the letter of the Smyrnaeans on the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of St. Polycarp, c. 156.

<p>The Epistle is in the name of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> but the early authorities always ascribe it to Clement. Dionysius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, wrote c. 170 to the Romans in Pope Soter's time: "Today we kept the holy day, the Lord's day, and on it we read your letter- and we shall ever have it to give us instruction, even as the former one written through Clement" (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250104.htm"><em>Church History</em> IV.30</a>). Hegesippus attributed the letter to Clement. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, c. 180-5 perhaps using Hegesippus, says: "Under this Clement no small sedition took place among the brethren at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> sent a most sufficient letter to the Corinthians, establishing them in peace, and renewing their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and announcing the tradition it had recently received from the Apostles" (III, iii). <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a>, c. 200, frequently quotes the Epistle as Clement's, and so do <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> and <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>. Lightfoot and Harnack are fond of pointing out that we hear earlier of the importance of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> than of the authority of the Roman <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. If Clement had spoken in his own name, they would surely have noted expressly that he wrote not as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>, but as an aged "presbyter" who had known the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>. St. John indeed was still alive, and Corinth was rather nearer to Ephesus than to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Clement evidently writes officially, with all that authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> of which Ignatius and <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> have so much to say.

<p>An ancient <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> by an anonymous author has come down to us in the same two Greek <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> as the <a href="../fathers/1010.htm"><em>Epistle of Clement</em></a>, and is called the <a href="../fathers/1011.htm"><em>Second Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians</em></a>. It is first mentioned by <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.37</a>), who considered it spurious, as being unknown to the ancients; he is followed (perhaps not independently) by Rufinus and Jerome. Its inclusion as a letter of Clement in the <a href="../cathen/04080c.htm">Codex Alexandrinus</a> of the whole Bible in the fifth century is the earliest testimony to a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in its authenticity; in the sixth century it is quoted by the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> leaders Timothy of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and Severus of Antioch, and it was later known to many Greek writers. This witness is a great contrast to the very early veneration paid to the genuine letter. Hilgenfeld's theory that it is the letter of Pope Soter to the Corinthians, mentioned by Dionysius in the fragment quoted above, was accepted by many critics, until the discovery of the end of the work by Bryennios showed that it was not a letter at all, but a <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a>. Still Harnack has again and again defended this view. An apparent reference to the Isthmian Games in 7 suggests that the <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homily</a> was delivered at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>; but this would be in character if it was a letter addressed to Corinth. Lightfoot and others think it earlier than <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, c. 140, but its reference to <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> views does not allow us to place it much earlier. The matter of the sermon is a very general exhortation, and there is no definite plan or sequence. Some citations from unknown Scriptures are interesting.

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">The <em>editio princeps</em> of the two "Epistles to the Corinthians" is that of Patrick Young, 1633 (2d ed., 1637), from the famous Codex Alexandrinus (A) of the whole Bible in Greek. A number of editions followed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (enumerated by Funk, Gebhardt, and Lightfoot). in the nineteenth we may notice those of C. J. Hefele (T&uuml;bingen, 1st ed., 1839), Jacobson (Oxford, 1st ed., 1840, etc.), Dressel (Leipzig, 1857), in the editions of the Apostolic Fathers by these writers. An edition by Bishop J. B. Lightfoot appeared in 1869 (London and Cambridge), one by J. C. M. Laurent in 1870 (Leipzig), and one by 0. von Gebhardt and A. Harnack in 1875 (Leipzig). All these editions are founded on the one MS., which gives both letters incompletely, and not always legibly. On its doubtful readings Tischendorf wrote in 1873 (Clementis Rom. Epistulae, Leipzig), and he gave a so-called facsimile in 1867 (Appendix codicum celeberrimorum Sinaitici et Vaticani, Leipzig). A photographic reproduction of the whole codex was published at the British Museum in 1879. In 1875 the complete text of both Epistles was published by Bryennios at Constantinople, from-a MS. in the Patriarchal library of that city. It was used in Hilgenfeld's "Clementis Romani Epistulae" (2d ed., Leipzig, 1876), in the second edition of Gebhardt and Harnack (1876). In Lightfoot's edition of 1877 (London) a Syriac version was also used for the first time. The MS. was written in 1170, and is in the Cambridge University Library. It has been published in full by R. L. Bensley and R. H. Kennett, "The Epistles of St. Clement to the Corinthians in Syriac" (London, 1899). Dr. Funk's "Opera Patrum Apostolicorum" first appeared in 1878-81 (T&uuml;bingen). The great and comprehensive posthumous edition of Lightfoot's "Clement of Rome" (which contains a photographic facsimile of the Constantinople MS.) was published in 1890 (2 vols. London). The Greek text and English translation are reprinted by Lightfoot, "The Apostolic Fathers" (1 vol., London, 1891). In 1878 Dom Germain Morin discovered a Latin translation of the genuine Epistle in an eleventh-century MS. in the library of the Seminary of Namur (Anecdota Maredsolana, 2 vols., "S. Clementis ad Corinthios Epistulae versio antiquissima", Maredsous, 1894). The version is attributed to the second century by Harnack and others. It has been employed to correct the text in Funk's latest edition (1901), and by R. Knopf, "Der erste Clemensbrief" (in "Texte und Unters.", New Series, Leipzig, 1899). Besides Lightfoot's excellent English rendering, there is a translation of the two Epistles in "Ante-Nicene Chr. Lit." (Edinburgh, 1873, I).</p></div>
