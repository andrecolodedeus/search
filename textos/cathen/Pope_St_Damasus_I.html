<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope St. Damasus I</h1>  

<p>Born about 304; died 11 December, 384. His father, Antonius, was probably a <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>; the name of his mother, Laurentia, was not known until quite recently. Damasus seems to have been born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that he grew up there in the service of the church of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> St. Laurence. He was elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in October, 366, by a large majority, but a number of over-zealous adherents of the deceased <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a> rejected him, chose the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Ursinus (or Ursicinus), had the latter irregularly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, and resorted to much <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and bloodshed in order to seat him in the Chair of Peter. Many details of this <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> conflict are related in the highly prejudiced "Libellus Precum" (P.L., XIII, 83-107), a petition to the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authority</a> on the part of Faustinus and Marcellinus, two anti-Damasan <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> (cf. also Ammianus Marcellinus, Rer. Gest., XXVII, c. iii). Valentinian recognized Damasus and banished (367) Ursinus to <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, whence he was later allowed to return to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, but was forbidden to come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> or its vicinity. The party of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> (later at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> an adherent of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and to the end a contentious pretender) did not cease to persecute Damasus. An accusation of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> was laid against him (378) in the imperial court, but he was exonerated by Emperor Gratian himself (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Coll. Conc., III, 628) and soon after by a Roman synod of forty-four <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> (Liber Pontificalis, ed. Duchesne, s.v.; <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, op. cit., III, 419) which also <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> his accusers.

<p>Damasus defended with vigour the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> in a time of dire and varied perils. In two Roman <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> (368 and 369) he condemned <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarianism</a> and Macedonianism; he also sent his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to the Council of Constantinople (381), convoked against the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. In the Roman synod of 369 (or 370) Auxentius, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>; he held the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, however, until his death, in 374, made way for <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> Priscillian, condemned by the Council of Saragossa (380) appealed to Damasus, but in vain. It was Damasus who induced Saint Jerome to undertake his famous revision of the earlier Latin versions of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> (see <a href="../cathen/15515b.htm">VULGATE</a>). <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> was also his confidential secretary for some time (Ep. cxxiii, n. 10). An important canon of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> was proclaimed by him in the Roman synod of 374. The <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil of C&aelig;sarea</a>, besought earnestly the aid and encouragement of Damasus against triumphant <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, however, cherished some degree of suspicion against the great Cappadocian Doctor. In the matter of the Meletian Schism at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, Damasus, with <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> and <a href="../cathen/11771a.htm">Peter of Alexandria</a>, sympathized with the party of Paulinus as more sincerely representative of Nicene <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>; on the death of Meletius he sought to secure the succession for Paulinus and to exclude <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a> (<a href="../cathen/14118b.htm">Socrates</a>, <a href="../fathers/26015.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.15</a>). He sustained the appeal of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> senators to Emperor Gratian for the removal of the altar of Victory from the Senate House (Ambrose, Ep. xvii, n. 10), and lived to welcome the famous edict of <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius I</a>, "De fide Catholica" (27 Feb., 380), which proclaimed as the religion of the Roman State that <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which St. Peter had preached to the Romans and of which Damasus was supreme head (Cod. Theod., XVI, 1, 2).

<p>When, in 379, Illyricum was detached from the Western Empire, Damasus hastened to safeguard the authority of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> by the appointment of a <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicar Apostolic</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Ascholius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>; this was the origin of the important <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> vicariate long attached to that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. The primacy of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, variously favoured in the time of Damasus by imperial acts and edicts, was strenuously maintained by this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; among his notable utterances on this subject is the assertion (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, Coll. Conc., VIII, 158) that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> was based, not on the decrees of councils, but on the very words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs18">Matthew 16:18</a>). The increased prestige of the early <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">papal decretals</a>, habitually attributed to the reign of Siricius (384-99), not improbably belongs to the reign of Damasus ("Canones Romanorum ad Gallos"; Babut, "La plus ancienne d&eacute;cr&eacute;tale", Paris, 1904). This development of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> office, especially in the West, brought with it a great increase of external grandeur. This secular splendour, however, affected disadvantageously many members of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, whose worldly aims and life, bitterly reproved by <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, provoked (29 July, 370) and edict of Emperor Valentinian addressed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, forbidding <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> (later also <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>) to pursue <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> in the hope of obtaining from them gifts and legacies. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> caused the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> to be observed strictly.

<p>Damasus restored his own church (now San Lorenzo in Damaso) and provided for the proper housing of the archives of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> (see VATICAN ARCHIVES). He built in the basilica of St. Sebastian on the Appian Way the (yet visible) marble monument known as the "Platonia" (<em>Platona</em>, marble pavement) in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the temporary transfer to that place (258) of the bodies of Sts. Peter and Paul, and decorated it with an important historical inscription (see <a href="../cathen/11111a.htm">Northcote</a> and Brownlow, Roma Sotterranea). He also built on the Via Ardeatina, between the cemeteries of Callistus and <a href="../cathen/06098b.htm">Domitilla</a>, a <em>basilicula</em>, or small church, the ruins of which were discovered in 1902 and 1903, and in which, according to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was buried with his mother and sister. On this occasion the discoverer, Monsignor Wilpert, found also the epitaph of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> mother, from which it was learned not only that her name was Laurentia, but also that she had lived the sixty years of her <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widowhood</a> in the special service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and died in her eighty-ninth year, having seen the fourth generation of her descendants. Damasus built at the Vatican a <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Peter and set up therein one of his artistic inscriptions (Carmen xxxvi), still preserved in the Vatican <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypts</a>. This subterranean region he drained in order that the bodies buried there (<em>juxta sepulcrum beati Petri</em>) might not be affected by stagnant or overflowing water. His extraordinary devotion to the Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> is now well known, owing particularly to the labours of <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">Giovanni Battista De Rossi</a>. For a good account of his <a href="../cathen/05257a.htm">architectural</a> restoration of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> and the unique artistic characters (Damasan Letters) in which his friend Furius Dionysius Filocalus executed the epitaphs composed by Damasus, see <a href="../cathen/11111a.htm">Northcote</a> and Brownlow, "Roma Sotterranea" (2nd ed., London, 1878-79). The dogmatic content of the Damasan epitaphs (<em>tituli</em>) is important (<a href="../cathen/11111a.htm">Northcote</a>, Epitaphs of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacombs</a>, London, 1878). He composed also a number of brief <em>epigrammata</em> on various <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and some <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, or <em>Carmina</em>, likewise brief. <a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a> says (Ep. xxii, 22) that Damasus wrote on virginity, both in prose and in verse, but no such work has been preserved. For the few letters of Damasus (some of them spurious) that have survived, see P.L., XIII, 347-76, and Jaff&eacute;, "Reg. Rom. Pontif." (Leipzig, 1885), nn. 232-254.
