<h1>Pope St. Dionysius</h1>  

<p>Date of birth unknown; d. 26 or 27 December, 268. During the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/14288a.htm">Pope Stephen</a> (254-57) Dionysius appears as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and as such took part in the controversy concerning the validity of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">BAPTISM</a> under sub-title <em>Rebaptism</em>). This caused Bishop <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a> to write him a letter on <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in which he is described as an excellent and learned man (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, Hist eccl. VII, vii). Later, in the time of <a href="../cathen/14031c.htm">Pope Sixtus II</a> (257-58), the same <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> addressed Dionysius a letter concerning Lucianus (ibid., VII, ix), who this Lucianus was is not known. After the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of <a href="../cathen/14031c.htm">Sixtus II</a> (6 August, 258) the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> for nearly a year, as the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> made it impossible to elect a new head. It was not until the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> had begun to subside that Dionysius was raised (22 July, 259) to the office of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>. Some months later the <a href="../cathen/06366a.htm">Emperor Gallienus</a> issued his edict of toleration, which brought the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> to an end and gave a legal existence to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.13</a>). Thus the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> came again into possession of its buildings for worship, its cemeteries, and other properties, and Dionysius was able to bring its administration once more into order. About 260 Bishop <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a> wrote his letter to Ammonius and Euphranor against <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Sabellianism</a> in which he expressed himself with inexactness as to the Logos and its relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a> (see <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">DIONYSIUS OF ALEXANDRIA</a>). Upon this an accusation against him was laid before Pope Dionysius who called a synod at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> about 260 for the settlement of the matter. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> issued, in his own name and that of the council, an important <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> letter in which, first, the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Sabellius was again condemned and, then, the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> opinions of those were rejected who, like the <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionites</a>, in a similar manner separate the Divine monarchy into three entirely distinct hypostases or who represent the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> as a created being, while the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> declare Him to have been begotten passages in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, such as <a href="../bible/deu032.htm#vrs6">Deuteronomy 32:6</a> and <a href="../bible/pro008.htm#vrs22">Proverbs 8:22</a>, cannot be cited in support of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrines</a> such as these. Along with this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> epistle Pope Dionysius sent a separate letter to the Alexandrian Bishop in which the latter was called on to explain his views. This <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">Dionysius of Alexandria</a> did in his "Apologia" (Athanasius, De sententia Dionysii, V, xiii, De decretis Nicaenae synodi, xxvi). According to the ancient practice of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> Dionysius also extended his care to the faithful of distant lands. When the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Cappadocia were in great distress from the marauding incursions of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> addressed a consolatory letter to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Caesarea and sent a large sum of money by messengers for the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of enslaved <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (Basilius, Epist. lxx, ed. Garnier). The great synod of Antioch which deposed <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a> sent a circular letter to Pope Dionysius and Bishop Maximus of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> concerning its proceedings (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.30</a>). After death the body of Dionysius was buried in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacomb</a> of Callistus.
