<h1>Pope St. Eugene I</h1>  

<p>Eugene I was elected 10 Aug., 654, and died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 2 June, 657. Because he would not submit to Byzantine dictation in the matter of <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a>, <a href="../cathen/09723c.htm">St. Martin I</a> was forcibly carried off from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (18 June, 653) and kept in exile till his death (September, 655). What happened in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> after his departure is not well known. For a time the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was governed in the manner usual in those days during a vacancy of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, or during the absence of its occupant, viz., by the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, and the primicerius of the notaries. But after about a year and two months a successor was given to Martin in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Eugene (10 Aug., 654). He was a Roman of the first <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> region of the city, and was the son of Rufinianus. He had been a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> from his earliest years, and is set down by his biographer as distinguished for his gentleness, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, and generosity. With regard to the circumstances of his election, it can only be said that if he was forcibly placed on the Chair of Peter by the power of the emperor, in the hope that he would follow the imperial will, these calculations miscarried; and that, if he was elected against the will of the reigning <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the first instance, Pope Martin subsequently acquiesced in his election (Ep. Martini xvii in P.L., LXXXVII).

<p>One of the first acts of the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was to send <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to Constantinople with letters to the Emperor Constans II, informing him of his election, and presenting a profession of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> allowed themselves to be deceived, or gained over, and brought back a synodical letter from Peter, the new <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople (656-666), while the emperor's envoy, who accompanied them, brought offerings for St. Peter, and a request from the emperor that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> would enter into communion with the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. Peter's letter proved to be written in the most obscure style, and avoided making any specific declaration as to the number of "wills or operations" in Christ. When its contents were communicated to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Mary Major, they not only rejected the letter with indignation, but would not allow the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to leave the basilica until he had promised that he would not on any account accept it (656). So furious were the Byzantine officials at this contemptuous rejection of the wishes of their emperor and patriarch that they threatened, in their coarse phraseology, that when the state of politics allowed it, they would roast Eugene, and all the talkers at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> along with him, as they had roasted <a href="../cathen/09723c.htm">Pope Martin I</a> (Disp. inter S. Maxim. et Theod. in P.L., CXXXIX, 654). Eugene was saved from the fate of his predecessor by the advance of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> who took Rhodes in 654, and defeated Constans himself in the naval battle of Phoenix (655). It was almost certainly this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> who received the youthful <a href="../cathen/15621c.htm">St. Wilfrid</a> on the occasion of his first visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (c. 654). He went thither because he was anxious to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> "the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and monastic rites which were in use there". At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he gained the affection of Archdeacon Boniface, a counsellor of the apostolic <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who presented him to his master. Eugene "placed his blessed hand on the head of the youthful servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for him, and blessed him" (Bede, Hist. Eccles., V, 19; Eddius, In vit. Wilf., c. v). Nothing more is known of Eugene except that he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> twenty-one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for different parts of the world, and that he was buried in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. In the Roman Martyrology he is reckoned among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of that day.
