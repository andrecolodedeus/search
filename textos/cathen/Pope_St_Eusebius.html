<h1>Pope St. Eusebius</h1>  

<p>Successor of Marcellus, 309 or 310. His reign was short. The Liberian Catalogue gives its duration as only four months, from 18 April to 17 August, 309 or 310. We learn some details of his career from an epitaph for his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> which Pope Damasus ordered. This epitaph had come down to us through ancient transcripts. A few fragments of the original, together with a sixth-century marble copy made to replace the original, after its destruction were found by <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> in the Papal Chapel, in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> of Callistus. It appears from this epitaph that the grave internal dissentions caused in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> by the readmittance of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">apostates <em>(lapsi)</em></a> during the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, and which had already arisen under Marcellus, continued under Eusebius. The latter maintained the attitude of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, adopted after the <a href="../cathen/04666a.htm">Decian</a> persecutions (250-51), that the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> should not be forever debarred from <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> communion, but on the other hand, should be readmitted only after doing proper penance <em>(Eusebius miseros docuit sua crimina flere)</em>.

<p>This view was opposed by a faction of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under the leadership of one Heraclius. Whether the latter and his partisans advocated a more rigorous (Novationist) or a more lenient interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has not been ascertained. The latter, however, is by far more probable in the hypothesis that Heraclius was the chief of a party made up of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> and their followers, who demanded immediate restoration to the body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Damasus characterizes in very strong terms the conflict which ensued <em>(seditcio, c&oelig;des, bellum, discordia, lites).</em> It is likely that Heraclius and his supporters sought to compel by force their admittance to divine worship, which was resented by the faithful gathered in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> about Eusebius. In consequence both Eusebius and Heraclius were exiled by <a href="../cathen/10073b.htm">Emperor Maxentius</a>. Eusebius, in particular, was deported to <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, where he died soon after. <a href="../cathen/10318a.htm">Miltiades</a> ascended the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne, 2 July, 311. The body of his predecessor was brought back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, probably in 311, and 26 September (according to the "Depositio Episcoporum" in the chronographer of 354) was placed in a separate cubiculum of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Callistus. His firm defense of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> and the banishment which he suffered therefor <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and in his epitaph Pope Damasus honours Eusebius with this title. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is yet celebrated on 26 September.
