<h1>Pope St. Felix III</h1>  

<p>(Reigned 483-492).

<p>Born of a Roman senatorial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and said to have been an ancestor of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Saint Gregory the Great</a>. Nothing certain is known of Felix, till he succeeded St. Simplicitus in the Chair of Peter (483). At that time the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was still in the midst of her long conflict with the <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">Eutychian heresy</a>. In the preceding year, the Emperor Zeno, at the suggestion of Acacius, the perfidious <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinoble, had issued an edict known as the Hereticon or Act of Union, in which he declared that no symbol of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, other than that of <a href="../cathen/11048a.htm">Nice</a>, with the additions of 381, should be received. The edict was intended as a bond of reconciliation between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/05633a.htm">Eutychians</a>, but it caused greater conflicts than ever, and split the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the East into three or four parties. As the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> everywhere spurned the edict, the emperor had driven the Patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria from their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. Peter the Tanner, a <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, had again intruded himself into the See of Antioch, and <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Peter Mongus</a>, who was to be the real source of trouble during the pontificate of Felix, had seized that of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. In his first synod Felix <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Peter the Tanner, who was likewise condemned by Acacius in a synod of Constantinoble. In 484, Felix also <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Peter Mongus</a> &#151; an act, which brought about a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> between East and West, that was not healed for thirty-five years. This Peter, being a time-server and of a crafty deposition, ingratiated himself with the emperor and Acacius by subscribing to the <a href="../cathen/07218b.htm">Henoticon</a>, and was thereupon, to the displeasure of many of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, admitted to communion by Acacius.

<p>Felix, having convened a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a>, sent <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to the emperor and Acacius, with the request that they should expel <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Peter Mongus</a> from <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and that Acacius himself should come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to explain his conduct. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> were detained and <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a>; then urged by threats and promises, they held communion with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> by distinctly uttering the name of Peter in the readings of the sacred <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>. When their treason was made known at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Simeon, one of the "Acaemeti" <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, Felix convened a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> of seventy-seven <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a>, in which Acacius as well as the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> were also <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Supported by the emperor Acacius disregarded the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, removed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> name from the sacred <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>, and remained in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> till his death, which took place one or two years later. His successor Phravitas, sent messengers to Felix, assuring him that he would not hold communion with Peter, but, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> learning that this was a deception, the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> continued. Peter, having died in the meantime Ethymus who succeeded Phravitas, also sought communion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> refused, as Euthymius would not remove the names of his two predecessors from the sacred <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, known as the <a href="../cathen/01082a.htm">Acacian</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">Schism</a> was not finally healed till 518 in the reign of Justinian. In Africa the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, Genseric and his son Huneric had been persecuting the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for more than 50 years and had driven many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> into exile. When peace was restored, numbers of those who through fear had fallen into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and had been rebaptized by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> desired to return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. On being repulsed by those who had remained firm, they appealed to Felix who convened a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> in 487, and sent a letter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Africa, expounding the conditions under which they were to be received back. Felix died in 492, having reigned eight years, eleven months and twenty-three days.
