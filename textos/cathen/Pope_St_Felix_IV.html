<h1>Pope St. Felix IV</h1>  

<p>(Reigned 526-530).

<p>On 18 May, 526, <a href="../cathen/08421a.htm">Pope John I</a> died in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, a victim of the angry suspicions of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> king of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>. When, through the powerful influence of this ruler, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a>, Felix of Samnium, son of Castorius, was brought forward in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as John's successor, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> yielded to the wish of the <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Gothic king</a> and chose Felix <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a> 12 July, 526, and took advantage of the favor he enjoyed at the court of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> to further the interests of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, discharging the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office in a most worthy manner. On 30 August, 526, <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> died, and, his grandson Athalaric being a minor, the government was conducted by Athalaric's mother Amalasuntha, daughter of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> and favorably disposed towards the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. To the new ruler the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> addressed a complaint on the usurpation of their privileges by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>. A royal edict, drawn up by <a href="../cathen/03405c.htm">Cassiodorus</a> in terms of the deepest respect for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority, confirmed the ancient custom that every civil or criminal charge of a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> against a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> should be submitted to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, or to an <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">ecclesiastical court</a> appointed by him. A fine of ten pounds of gold was imposed as a punishment for the violation of this order, and the money thus obtained was to be distributed amongst the poor by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (Cassiodorus, "Variae", VIII, n. 24, ed. Mommsen, "Mon. Germ. Hist.: Auctores antiquiss.", XII, 255) The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> received as a gift from Amalasuntha two ancient edifices in the Roman Forem, the Temple of Romulus, son of the <a href="../cathen/10073b.htm">Emperor Maxentius</a>, and the adjoining <em>Templum sacroe urbis</em>, the Roman land registry office. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> converted the buildings into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of SS. Cosmas and Damian, which still exists and in the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of which is preserved the large and magnificent <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> executed by order of Felix, the figure of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, however, being a later restoration (see COSMAS AND DAMIAN). Felix also took part in the so-called <a href="../cathen/13703a.htm">Semipelagian</a> conflict in Southern Gaul concerning the nature and efficiency of grace. He sent to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of those parts a series of "Capitula", regarding grace and <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, compiled from Scripture and the Fathers. These capitula were published as canons at the Synod of Orange (529). In addition Felix approved the work of <a href="../cathen/03135b.htm">Caesarius of Arles</a> against <a href="../cathen/06019b.htm">Faustus of Riez</a> on grace and <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> (De gratia et libero arbitrio). Rendered anxious by the political dissensions of the Romans, many of whom stood for the interests of Byzantium, while others supported Gothic Rule, Felix IV, when he fell seriously ill in the year 530, wished to ensure the peace of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> by naming his successor. Having given over to Archdeacon Boniface his <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, he made it known publicly that he had chosen <a href="../cathen/02660a.htm">Boniface</a> to succeed him, and that he had apprised the court of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> of his action ("Neues Archiv", XI, 1886, 367; Duchesne, <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, I, 282, note 4). Felix IV died soon afterwards, but in the papal election which followed his wishes were disregarded (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/02660a.htm">BONIFACE II</a>). The feast of Felix IV is celebrated on 30 January. The day of his death is uncertain, but it was probably towards the end of September, 530.
