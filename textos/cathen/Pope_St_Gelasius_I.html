<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope St. Gelasius I</h1>  

<p>Died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 19 Nov., 496. Gelasius, as he himself states in his letter to the Emperor Anastasius (Ep. xii, n. 1), was <em>Romanus natus</em>. The assertion of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> that he was <em>natione Afer</em> is consequently taken by many to mean that he was of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">African</a> origin, though Roman born. Others, however, interpreting natione Afer as "African by birth", explain <em>Romanus natus</em> as "born a Roman citizen". Before his election as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, 1 March, 492, Gelasius had been much employed by his predecessor, <a href="../cathen/06030b.htm">Felix II (or III)</a>, especially in drawing up <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> documents, which has led some scholars to confuse the writings of the two pontiffs.

<p>On his election to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, Gelasius at once showed his strength of character and his lofty conception of his position by his firmness in dealing with the adherents of Acacius (see <a href="../cathen/01082a.htm">ACACIUS, PATRIARCH OF CONSTANTINOPLE</a>). Despite all the efforts of the otherwise <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> patriarch, <a href="../cathen/05606a.htm">Euphemius of Constantinople</a>, and the threats and wiles by which the Emperor Anastasius tried to obtain recognition from the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, Gelasius, though hard-pressed by difficulties at home, would make no peace that compromised in the slightest degree the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and honor of the Chair of Peter. The constancy with which he combated the pretensions, lay and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>, of the New Rome; the resoluteness with which he refused to allow the civil or temporal pre-eminence of a city to determine its <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rank; the unfailing <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> with which he defended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the "second" and the "third" sees, <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and Antioch, are some of the most striking features of his pontificate. It has been well said that nowhere at this period can be found stronger arguments for the primacy of Peter's See than in the works and writings of Gelasius. He is never tired of repeating that <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> owes its <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> princedom not to an oecumenical synod nor to any temporal importance it may have possessed, but to the Divine institution of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, Who conferred the primacy over the whole Church upon Peter and his successors. (Cf. especially his letters to Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretal</a> on the canonical and <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> books.) In his dealing with the emperor he is at one with the great <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> pontiffs. "There are two powers by which chiefly this world is ruled: the sacred authority of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and the authority of kings. And of these the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> is so much the weightier, as they must render before the tribunal of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> an account even for the kings of men." Gelasius's pontificate was too short to effect the complete submission and reconciliation of the ambitious Church of Byzantium. Not until Hormisdas (514-23) did the contest end in the return of the East to its old allegiance. Troubles abroad were not the only occasions to draw out the energy and strength of Gelasius. The Lupercalia, a <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a> and somewhat licentious vestige of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was finally abolished by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> after a long contest. Gelasius's letter to Andromachus, the senator, covers the main lines of the controversy.

<p>A stanch upholder of the old traditions, Gelasius nevertheless <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> when to make exceptions or modifications, such as his <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliging</a> the reception of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> under both kinds. This was done as the only effective way of detecting the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, who, though present in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in large numbers, sought to divert attention from their hidden propaganda by feigning <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>. As they held wine to be impure and essentially <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, they would refuse the <a href="../cathen/03561a.htm">chalice</a> and thus be recognized. Later, with the change of conditions, the old normal method of receiving <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> under the form of bread alone returned into vogue. To Gelasius we owe the ordinations on the <a href="../cathen/05399b.htm">ember days</a> (Ep. xv), as well as the enforcement of the fourfold division of all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> revenues, whether income from estates or <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> donations of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, one portion for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, another for the support of the churches and the splendour of Divine service, a third for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the fourth for the minor <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Though some writers ascribe the origin of this division of church funds to Gelasius, still the pontiff speaks of it (Ep. xiv, n. 27) as <em>dudum rationabiliter decretum</em>, having been for some time in force. Indeed, <a href="../cathen/14002a.htm">Pope Simplicius</a> (475, Ep. i, n. 2) imposed the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of restitution to the poor and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> upon a certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who had failed in this <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>; consequently it must have been already regarded as at least a custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Not content with one enunciation of this charitable <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, Gelasius frequently inculcates it in his writings to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. For a long time the fixing of the Canon of the Scriptures was attributed to Gelasius, but it seems now more probably the work of Damasus (367-85). As Gelasius, however, in a Roman synod (494), published his celebrated catalogue of the authentic writings of the Fathers, together with a list of <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> and interpolated works, as well as the proscribed books of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> (Ep. xlii), it was but natural to prefix to this catalogue the Canon of the Scriptures as determined by the earlier Pontiff, and thus in the course of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the Canon itself came to be ascribed to Gelasius. In his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the beauty and majesty of Divine service, Gelasius composed many <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, prefaces, and collects, and arranged a standard Mass-book, though the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> that has commonly gone by his name, the "Sacramentarium Gelasianum", belongs properly to the next century. How much of it is the work of Gelasius is still a moot question. Though <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> but for four years and a half, he exerted a deep influence on the development of church polity, of the liturgy and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>. A large number of his decrees have been incorporated into the Canon Law.

<p>In his private life Gelasius was above all conspicuous for his spirit of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, penance, and study. He took great delight in the company of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> father to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, dying empty-handed as a result of his lavish charity. <a href="../cathen/05010b.htm">Dionysius Exiguus</a> in a letter to his friend, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Julian (P.L., LXVII, 231), gives a glowing account of Gelasius as he appeared to his contemporaries.

<p>As a writer Gelasius takes high rank for his period. His style is vigorous and elegant, though occasionally, obscure. Comparatively little of his literary work has come down to us, though he is said to have been the most prolific writer of all the pontiffs of the first five centuries. There are extant forty-two letters and fragments of forty-nine others, besides six treatises, of which three are concerned with the <a href="../cathen/01082a.htm">Acacian</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, one with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, another with the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of Nestorius and <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a>, while the sixth is directed against the senator Andromachus and the advocates of the Lupercalia. The best edition is that of Thiel.

<p>The feast of St. Gelasius is kept on 21 Nov., the anniversary of his interment, though many writers give this as the day of his death.
