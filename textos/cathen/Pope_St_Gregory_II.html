<h1>Pope St. Gregory II</h1>  

<p>(Reigned 715-731).

<p>Perhaps the greatest of the great <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> who occupied the chair of Peter during the eighth century, a Roman, son of Marcellus and Honesta. To his contemporaries in the West he was known as Gregory Junior or the Younger; to those in the East, who confounded him with <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory I</a> (author of "Dialogues") he was "Dialogus". The year of his birth is not known, but while very young he showed a desire for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and was placed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the "schola cantorum". He was made a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> and <em>sacellarius</em> (paymaster and almoner) of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/13728b.htm">Sergius I</a>. Then the care of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> was entrusted to him, and he has the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of being the first <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> almoner or librarian known to us by name. By the time he had become a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, he had given such signs of character and superior intelligence that he was chosen by Pope Constantine to accompany him when he had to go to Constantinople to discuss the canons of the <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Quinisext Council</a> with the truculent tyrant, Justinian II. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> trust was not misplaced. The <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Gregory "by his admirable answers", solved every difficulty raised by the emperor. One of the first things which Gregory took in hand when he became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (19 May, 715) was to put in repair the walls of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Not for the last time had the Lombards, those old enemies of the Romans, attacked their city and now a new foe had shown itself. The Mediterranean was fast becoming a <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> lake, and there was fear that the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslems</a> might make a descent upon the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a> itself. Gregory had made good progress with his work of repair, when various causes combined with a devastating flood of the Tiber to prevent him from completing it. But throughout all his pontificate, Gregory failed not to scan with anxiety the movements of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, and he is credited with having sent tokens of encouragement to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> leaders who were stemming their advance in Gaul.

<p>In the first year of his pontificate, he received a letter from John, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople. Addressed "to the sacred head of the Church", it was really an apology for his having shown himself subservient to Philippieus Bardanes in the matter of <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelism</a>. Gregory also received several distinguished <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> during his pontificate. Among the many Anglo-Saxon <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> who came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> during his reign, the most famous were Abbot Ceolfrid and King Ina, of whom the one took to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the famous <a href="../cathen/04081a.htm">Codex Amiatinus</a>, and the other founded the "Schola Anglorum". Duke Theodo I of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> also came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and no doubt to obtain from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> more preachers of the Hospel for his country. Among those whom Gregory dispatched for the conversion of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> was St. Corbibian, who became one of its apostles. But the great apostle of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, as of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> generally, was St. Winfrid, or <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a>, as he was afterwards called. Anxious to preach to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "moved the pontiff of the glorious See" to grant his wishes. He sent <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> "to the wild nations of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>", bidding him, by the irrefragable authority of Blessed Peter, "go forth and preach the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of both Testaments". Gregory watched and encouraged the work of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> unremittingly. In 722 he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and interested the famous Charles Mantel in his labours. Gregory was a great supporter of the monastic order. On the death of his mother, he converted his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parental</a> mansion into a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and founded or restored many others. Among those he helped to restore was the famous <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Abbey of Monte Cassino</a>. During the early portion of his pontificate, Gregory was on good terms with the Lombards. Their king drew up his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> under his influence; but their dukes, with or without the consent of their king, embroiled the peninsula by seizing portions of the possessions of the Greek empire. The Greek <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> was quite unable to stem the advance of the Lombards, so that Gregory appealed for help to <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. Charles could not or would not come, but greater commotion in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> than could have been caused by his advent was aroused by the publication there of the decrees of the Greek emperor, Leo III, known as the Isaurian or the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast</a> (727). The <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> had been previously enraged by his attempt to levy an extraordinary tax on them. Despite the attempts of Greek officials to take his life, Gregory opposed both the emperor's illegal taxes and his unwarrantable interference in the domain of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. Now was the opportunity of the Lombards. When the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> attempted to compel the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to obey the imperial decrees, they became his defenders. Nearly all the Byzantine districts of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> also turned against the emperor, and but for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> would have elected another emperor to oppose him. When all seemed lost to the Byzantine cause in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Eutychius, the last of the exarchs, contrived to wean the Lombards from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and to make them turn against him. The <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> was to help Liutprand, the Lombard king, to bring the almost independent Lombard Dukes of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> and <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> into complete subjection of his authority, and Liutprand was to assist him in bringing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to his knees. But the personal influence of Gregory over Liutprand was able to dissolve this unnatural alliance, and he repaid the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch's</a> treatment of him by furnishing him with troops to put down a rebellion against the imperial authority.

<p>In connection with Gregory's struggle against the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast</a> emperor and his Italian representatives, certain <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> points have been hitherto passed over. For instance, it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that about the year 730 <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> fell for a brief space into the hands of the Lombards, and that by the exertions of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>, it was recovered and continued to remain for a year or two longer a portion of the Byzantine empire. It is not, however, certain whether it was Gregory II or <a href="../cathen/06789a.htm">Gregory III</a> who rendered this important service to Leo III. Probably, however, it was done by Gregory II about the year 727; though perhaps it is not quite equally probable that the two famous condemnatory letters which Gregory II is said to have sent to Leo III are genuine. If they are authentic, then it is certain not only that <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> was captured by the Lombards about 727, but that the independent temporal authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> which in fact began with Gregory II was consciously felt by him. But when later Greek historians asserted that Gregory "separated <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and the whole West from political and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> subjection" to the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>, they are simply exaggerating his opposition to the emperor's illegal taxes, and <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclastic</a> edicts. Despite all provocation, Gregory never for a moment swerved in his loyalty to the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast</a> emperor; but, as in <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> bound, he opposed his efforts to destroy an article of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. By his letters sent in all directions he warned the people against the teachings of the emperor, and in a council at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (727) proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on the question of the worship of images. To the best of his power, also, he supported St. Germainus, the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, in the resistance he was making to the "gospel of Leo", and threatened to depose Anastasius, who had replaced the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> in the See of Constantinople, if he did not renounce his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Gregory recognized both the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Forum Julii (Cividale) and the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Grado as joint heirs of the original <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan See</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, and for a time caused these rival <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> to live in peace.

<p>Gregory died in February, and was buried in St. Peter's (11 Feb., 731). He is honoured as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> and other martyrologies.
