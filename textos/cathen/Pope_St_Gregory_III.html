<h1>Pope St. Gregory III</h1>  

<p>(Reigned 731-741.)

<p>Pope St. Gregory III was the son of a <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syrian</a> named John. The date of his birth is not known. His reputation for learning and virtue was so great that the Romans elected him <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by <a href="../cathen/01099a.htm">acclamation</a>, when he was accompanying the funeral procession of his predecessor, 11 February, 731. As he was not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> for more than a month after his election, it is presumed that he waited for the confirmation of his election by the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. In the matter of <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasm</a>, he followed the policy of his predecessor. He sent <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> and letters to remonstrate with the persecuting emperor, Leo III, and held two <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (731) in which the image-breaking <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was condemned. By way of a practical protest against the emperor's action he made it a point of paying special <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to images and <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a>, giving particular attention to the subject of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. Fragments of inscriptions, to be seen in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypts</a> of the Vatican basilica, bear witness to this day of an oratory he built therein, and of the special <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> he ordered to be there recited.

<p>Leo, whose sole answer to the arguments and apologies for image worship which were addressed to him from both East and West, was force, seized the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> patrimonies in Calabria and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, or wherever he had any power in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and transferred to the patriarch of Constantinople the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had previously exercised both there, and throughout the ancient Prefecture of Illyricum. Gregory III confirmed the decision of his predecessors as to the respective <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the Patriarchs of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> and Grado, and sent the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> to Antoninus of Grado. In granting it also to <a href="../cathen/05326a.htm">Egbert of York</a>, he was only following out the arrangements of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory I</a> who had laid it down that York was to have metropolitical <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> in the North of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, as Canterbury had to have them in the South. Both Tatwine and Nothelm of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> in succession from Gregory III (731 and 736). At his request Gregory III extended to <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> the same support and encouragement which had been afforded him by <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Gregory II</a>. "Strengthened exceedingly by the help of the affection of the Apostolic See", the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> joyfully continued his glorious work for the conversion of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. About 737 <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the third time to give an account of his stewardship, and to enjoy the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> "life-giving conversation", At Gregory's order the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and great traveller, St. Willibald, went to assist his cousin <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> in his labours.

<p>The close of Gregory's reign was troubled by the Lombards. Realizing the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> which animated Liutprand, Gregory completed the restoration of the walls of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> which had been begun by his predecessors, and bought back Gallese, a stronghold on the Flaminian Way, from Transamund, Duke of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, which helped to keep open the communications between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. In 739, Liutprand was again in arms. His troops ravaged the exarchate, and he himself marched south to bring to subjection his vassals, the Dukes of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> and <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, and the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Transamund fled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and Gregory implored the aid of the great <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> chief, <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a>. At length ambassadors from the viceroy (<em>subregulus</em>) of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> appeared in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (739). Their arrival, or the summer heats, brought a momentary peace. But in the following year, Liutprand again took the field. This time the Romans left their walls, and helped Transamund to recover <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>. When, however, he had recovered his duchy, he would not or could not comply with Gregory's request, and endeavour to recover for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> "the four cities of the Roman duchy which had been lost for his sake." In the midst of all these <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and rumours of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, Gregory died, and was buried in the oratory of our Lady which he had himself built in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. He died in 741, but whether in November or December is not certain. It is however, on 28 November that he is commemorated in the Roman <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a>.
