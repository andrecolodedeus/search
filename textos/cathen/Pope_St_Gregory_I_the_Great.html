<h1>Pope St. Gregory I ("the Great")</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a>; born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> about 540; died 12 March 604. Gregory

<blockquote><p>is certainly one of the most notable figures in <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">Ecclesiastical History</a>. He has exercised in many respects a momentous influence on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, the organization, and the <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. To him we must look for an explanation of the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> situation of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; indeed, if no account were taken of his work, the evolution of the form of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> would be almost inexplicable. And further, in so far as the modern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> system is a legitimate development of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, of this too Gregory may not unreasonably be termed the Father. Almost all the leading principles of the later <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> are found, at any rate in germ, in Gregory the Great. (F.H. Dudden, "Gregory the Great", 1, p. v). </p></blockquote>

<p>This eulogy by a learned non-Catholic writer will justify the length and elaboration of the following article.
<h2 id="section1">From birth to 574</h2>

<p>Gregory's <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was Gordianus, a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> patrician, probably of the famous <em>gens Amicia</em>, who owned large estates in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and a mansion on the Caelian Hill in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the ruins of which, apparently in a wonderful state of preservation, still await excavation beneath the Church of St. Andrew and St. Gregory. His mother <a href="../cathen/13794a.htm">Silvia</a> appears also to have been of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, but very little is known of her life. She is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, her <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> being kept on 3 November. Portraits of Gordianus and <a href="../cathen/13794a.htm">Silvia</a> were <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> by Gregory's order, in the <a href="../cathen/02059b.htm">atrium</a> of St. Andrew's <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and a pleasing description of these may be found in <a href="../cathen/08491a.htm">John the Deacon</a> (Vita, IV, lxxxiii).

<p>Besides his mother, two of Gregory's aunts have been <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonised</a>, Gordianus's two sisters, Tarsilla and &AElig;miliana, so that <a href="../cathen/08491a.htm">John the Deacon</a> speaks of his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> as being that of a <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> among <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.

<p>Of his early years we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing beyond what the history of the period tells us. Between the years 546 and 552 <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was first captured by the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> under Totila, and then abandoned by them; next it was garrisoned by Belisarius, and besieged in vain by the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>, who took it again, however, after the recall of Belisarius, only to lose it once more to Narses. Gregory's <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> and <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> were both exceptionally receptive, and it is to the effect produced on him by these disasters that we must attribute the tinge of sadness which pervades his writings and especially his clear expectation of a speedy end to the world.

<p>Of his <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, we have no details. <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> tells us that in grammar, rhetoric and <a href="../cathen/04770a.htm">dialectic</a> he was so skilful as to be thought second to none in all <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and it seems <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> also that he must have gone through a course of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legal</a> studies. Not least among the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educating</a> influences was the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">religious</a> atmosphere of his home. He loved to <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">meditate</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a> and to listen attentively to the conversations of his elders, so that he was "devoted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from his youth up".

<p>His rank and prospects pointed him out naturally for a public career, and he doubtless held some of the subordinate offices wherein a young patrician embarked on public life. That he acquitted himself well in these appears <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, since we find him about the year 573, when little more than thirty years old, filling the important office of prefect of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the brilliant post was shorn of much of its old magnificence, and its responsibilities were reduced; still it remained the highest civil dignity in the city, and it was only after long <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and inward struggle that Gregory decided to abandon everything and become a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. This event took place most probably in 574.

<p>His decision once taken, he devoted himself to the work and austerities of his new life with all the natural energy of his <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a>. His <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> estates were given up to found six <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> there, and his home on the Caelian Hill was converted into another under the <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">patronage</a> of <a href="../cathen/01471a.htm">St. Andrew</a>. Here he himself took the <a href="../cathen/04463a.htm">cowl</a>, so that "he who had been wont to go about the city clad in the <em>trabea</em> and aglow with silk and jewels, now clad in a worthless garment served the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>" (<a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a>, X, i).
<h2 id="section2">As monk and abbot (c. 574-590)</h2>

<p>There has been much discussion as to whether Gregory and his fellow-monks at St. Andrew's followed the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>. <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> and others on his authority have denied this, while it has been asserted as strongly by <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> and the <a href="../cathen/02630a.htm">Bollandists</a>, who, in the preface to the life of <a href="../cathen/02081a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (26 May), retract the opinion expressed earlier in the preface to St. Gregory's life (12 March). The controversy is important only in view of the question as to the form of <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monasticism</a> introduced by <a href="../cathen/02081a.htm">St. Augustine</a> into <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and it may be said that <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius's</a> view is now practically abandoned.

<p>For about three years Gregory lived in retirement in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Andrew, a period to which he often refers as the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiest</a> portion of his life. His great <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">austerities</a> during this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> are recorded by the biographers, and probably <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> the weak health from which he constantly suffered in later life.

<p>However, he was soon drawn out of his <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">seclusion</a>, when, in 578, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> him, much against his <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, as one of the seven <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> (<em>regionarii</em>) of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The period was one of acute crisis. The Lombards were advancing rapidly towards the city, and the only chance of safety seemed to be in obtaining help from the Emperor Tiberius at <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Byzantium</a>. <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pope Pelagius II</a> accordingly dispatched a special embassy to Tiberius, and sent Gregory along with it as his <em><a href="../cathen/01600a.htm">apocrisiarius</a></em>, or permanent ambassador to the Court of <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantium</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of this new appointment seems to have been the spring of 579, and it lasted apparently for about six years.

<p>Nothing could have been more uncongenial to Gregory than the worldly atmosphere of the brilliant <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine</a> Court, and to counteract its dangerous influence he followed the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">monastic life</a> so far as circumstances permitted. This was made easier by the fact that several of his brethren from St. Andrew's accompanied him to <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a>. With them he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> and studied the <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scriptures</a>, one result of which remains in his "Morals", or series of lectures on the <a href="../bible/job000.htm">Book of Job</a>, composed during this period at the request of <a href="../cathen/09102a.htm">St. Leander of Seville</a>, whose acquaintance Gregory made during his stay in <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a>.

<p>Much attention was attracted to Gregory by his controversy with <a href="../cathen/05638b.htm">Eutychius, Patriarch of Constantinople</a>, concerning the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">Resurrection</a>. <a href="../cathen/05638b.htm">Eutychius</a> had published a treatise on the subject maintaining that the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">risen</a> bodies of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> would be "impalpable, more light than air". To this view Gregory objected the palpability of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> risen body. The dispute became prolonged and bitter, till at length the emperor intervened, both combatants being summoned to a private audience, where they stated their views. The emperor decided that Gregory was in the right, and ordered <a href="../cathen/05638b.htm">Eutychius's</a> book to the burned. The strain of the struggle had been so great that both fell ill. Gregory recovered, but the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarch</a> succumbed, recanting his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> on his death bed.

<p>Mention should be made of the curious fact that, although Gregory's sojourn at <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a> lasted for six years, he seems never to have mastered even the rudiments of Greek. Possibly he found that the use of an interpreter had its advantages, but he often complains of the incapacity of those employed for this purpose. It must be owned that, so far as obtaining help for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was concerned, Gregory's stay at <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a> was a failure. However, his period as <a href="../cathen/01600a.htm">ambassador</a> taught him very plainly a lesson which was to bear great fruit later on when he ruled in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. This was the important fact that no help was any longer to be looked for from <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Byzantium</a>, with the corollary that, if <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> were to be saved at all, it could only be by vigorous independent action of the powers on the spot. Humanly speaking, it is to the fact that Gregory had acquired this conviction that his later line of action with all its momentous consequences is due.

<p>In the year 586, or possibly 585, he was recalled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and with the greatest <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> returned to St. Andrew's, of which he became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> soon afterwards. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> grew famous under his energetic rule, producing many <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who won renown later, and many vivid pictures of this period may be found in the "Dialogues".

<p>Gregory gave much of his <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to lecturing on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and is recorded to have expounded to his <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> the Heptateuch, <a href="../cathen/08652a.htm">Books of Kings</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">Prophets</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12505b.htm">Book of Proverbs</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03302a.htm">Canticle of Canticles</a>. Notes of these lectures were taken at the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> by a young student named Claudius, but when transcribed were found by Gregory to contain so many <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> that he insisted on their being given to him for correction and revision. Apparently this was never done, for the existing fragments of such works attributed to Gregory are almost certainly spurious.

<p>At this period, however, one important literary enterprise was certainly completed. This was the revision and publication of the "Magna Moralia", or lectures on the <a href="../cathen/08413a.htm">Book of Job</a>, undertaken in <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a> at the request of <a href="../cathen/09102a.htm">St. Leander</a>. In one of his letters (<a href="../fathers/360205053.htm">Epistle 5.53</a>) Gregory gives an interesting account of the origin of this work.

<p>To this period most probably should be assigned the famous incident of Gregory's meeting with the <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">English</a> youths in the Forum. The first mention of the event is in the <a href="../cathen/15609c.htm">Whitby</a> life (c, ix), and the whole story seems to be an <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">English</a> tradition. It is worth notice, therefore, that in the <a href="../cathen/13349a.htm">St. Gall</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> the <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">Angles</a> do not appear as <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slave</a> boys exposed for sale, but as men visiting <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of their own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, whom Gregory expressed a desire to see. It is <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> (Hist. Eccl., II, i) who first makes them <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slaves</a>.

<p>In consequence of this meeting Gregory was so fixed with desire to <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a> the <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">Angles</a> that he obtained permission from <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pelagius II</a> to go in person to Britain with some of his fellow-monks as missionaries. The Romans, however, were greatly incensed at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> act. With <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> words they demanded Gregory's recall, and messengers were at once dispatched to bring him back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by force. These men caught up with the little band of missionaries on the third day after their departure, and at once returned with them, Gregory offering no opposition, since he had received what appeared to him as a sign from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> that his enterprise should be abandoned.

<p>The strong feeling of the Roman populace that Gregory must not be allowed to leave <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> is a sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the position he now held there. He was in fact the chief adviser and assistant of <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pelagius II</a>, towards whom he seems to have acted very much in the capacity of secretary (see the letter of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> to Gregory, <a href="../fathers/360203066.htm">Epistle 3.66</a>, "Sedem apostolicam, quam antae moribus nunc etiam honore debito gubernatis"). In this capacity, probably in 586, Gregory wrote his important letter to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Istria who had separated from communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on the question of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> (Epp., Appendix, III, iii). This document, which is almost a treatise in length, is an admirable example of Gregory's skill, but it failed to produce any more effort than <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pelagius's</a> two previous letters had, and the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> continued.



<p>The year 589 was one of widespread disaster throughout all the empire. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> there was an unprecedented inundation. Farms and houses were carried away by the floods. The Tiber overflowed its banks, destroying numerous buildings, among them the granaries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with all the store of corn. Pestilence followed on the floods, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> became a very city of the dead. Business was at a standstill, and the streets were deserted save for the wagons which bore forth countless corpses for <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">burial</a> in common pits beyond the city walls.

<p>Then, in February, 590, as if to fill the cup of misery to the brim, <a href="../cathen/11603a.htm">Pelagius II</a> died. The choice of a <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">successor</a> lay with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and without any hesitation they <a href="../cathen/11456a.htm">elected</a> Gregory, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of St. Andrew's. In spite of their unanimity Gregory shrank from the dignity thus offered him. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, no doubt, that its acceptance meant a final good-bye to the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> life he loved, and so he not only refused to accede to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of his fellow citizens but also wrote personally to the <a href="../cathen/10069a.htm">Emperor Maurice</a>, begging him with all earnestness not to confirm the <a href="../cathen/11456a.htm">election</a>. Germanus, prefect of the city, suppressed this letter, however, and sent instead of it the formal schedule of the <a href="../cathen/11456a.htm">election</a>.

<p>In the interval while awaiting the <a href="../cathen/10069a.htm">emperor's</a> reply the business of the <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was transacted by Gregory, in commission with two or three other high officials. As the plague still continued unabated, Gregory called upon the people to join in a vast sevenfold <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> which was to start from each of the seven regions of the city and meet at the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">Basilica</a> of the Blessed Virgin, all <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> the while for pardon and the withdrawal of the pestilence. This was accordingly done, and the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> of the event is still preserved by the name "Sant' Angelo" given to the mausoleum of <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Hadrian</a> from the <a href="../cathen/09128a.htm">legend</a> that the <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">Archangel St. Michael</a> was seen upon its summit in the act of sheathing his sword as a sign that the plague was over.

<p>At length, after six months of waiting, came the <a href="../cathen/10069a.htm">emperor's</a> confirmation of Gregory's <a href="../cathen/11456a.htm">election</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> was terrified at the news and even meditated flight. He was seized, however, carried to the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Basilica of St. Peter</a>, and there <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on 3 September, 590. The story that Gregory actually fled the city and remained hidden in a forest for three days, when his whereabouts was <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">revealed</a> by a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> light, seems to be pure invention. It appears for the first time in the <a href="../cathen/15609c.htm">Whitby</a> life (c. vii), and is directly contrary to the words of his contemporary, <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours</a> (Hist. Franc., X, i). Still he never ceased to regret his elevation, and his later writings contain numberless expressions of strong feeling on this point.
<h2 id="section3">As pope (590-604)</h2>

<p>Fourteen years of <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> remained to Gregory, and into these he crowded work enough to have exhausted the energies of a lifetime. What makes his achievement more wonderful is his constant ill-health. He suffered almost continually from indigestion and, at intervals, from attacks of slow fever, while for the last half of his pontificate he was a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> to gout. In spite of these infirmities, which increased steadily, his biographer, <a href="../cathen/11591b.htm">Paul the Deacon</a>, tells us "he never rested" (Vita, XV). His work as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is of so varied a nature that it will be best to take it in sections, although this destroys any exact chronological sequence.

<p>At the very outset of his pontificate Gregory published his "Liber pastoralis curae", or book on the office of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, in which he lays down clearly the lines he considers it his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to follow. The work, which regards the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> pre-eminently as the physician of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, is divided into four parts.

<ul>
<li>He points out in the first that only one skilled already as a physician of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is fitted to undertake the "supreme rule" of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a>.
<li>In the second he describes how the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> life should be ordered from a spiritual point of view;
<li>in the third, how he ought to teach and admonish those under him,
<li>and in the fourth how, in spite of his <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> works, he ought to bear in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> his own weakness, since the better his work the greater the danger of falling through self-confidence.</ul>

<p>This little work is the key to Gregory's life as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, for what he preached he practiced. Moreover, it remained for centuries the textbook of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a>, so that by its influence the ideal of the great <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has moulded the character of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and his spirit has spread into all lands.
<h3 id="A">Life and work in Rome</h3>

<p>As <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> Gregory still lived with <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> simplicity. One of his first acts was to banish all the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay</a> attendants, pages, etc., from the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran</a> palace, and substitute <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> in their place. There was now no <em>magister militum</em> living in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, so the control even of military matters fell to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The inroads of the Lombards had filled the city with a multitude of indigent refugees, for whose support Gregory made provision, using for this purpose the existing machinery of the ecclesiastical districts, each of which had its deaconry or "office of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>". The corn thus distributed came chiefly from <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and was supplied by the estates of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>The temporal needs of his people being thus provided for, Gregory did not neglect their <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spiritual</a> wants, and a large number of his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a> have come down to us. It was he who instituted the <a href="../cathen/14268a.htm">"stations"</a> still observed and noted in the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>. He met the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">people</a> at some <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> previously agreed upon, and all together went in <a href="../cathen/12446c.htm">procession</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14268a.htm">station</a>, where <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> preached. These <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>, which drew immense crowds, are mostly simple, popular expositions of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>. Chiefly remarkable is the preacher's mastery of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, which he quotes unceasingly, and his regular use of anecdote to illustrate the point in hand, in which respect he paves the way for the popular preachers of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. In July, 595, Gregory held his first <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>, which consisted almost wholly of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14324a.htm">suburbicarian sees</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> titular churches. Six <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> dealing with <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> were passed, some of them merely confirming changes already made by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on his own authority.

<p>Much controversy still exists as to the exact extent of Gregory's reforms of the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgy</a>. All admit that he did make the following modifications in the pre-existing practice: <ul><li>In the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Canon of the Mass</a> he inserted the words "diesque nostros in tua pace disponas, atque ab aeterna damnatione nos eripi, et in electorum tuorum jubeas grege numerari"; <li>he ordered the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Pater Noster</a> to be recited in the <a href="../cathen/03255c.htm">Canon</a> <em>before</em> the breaking of the <a href="../cathen/07489d.htm">Host</a>; <li>he provided that the <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a> should be <a href="../cathen/09304a.htm">chanted</a> after the <a href="../cathen/06715a.htm">Gradual</a> out of <a href="../cathen/05524d.htm">paschal time</a>, to which period, apparently, the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> use had previously confined it; <li>he prohibited the use of the <a href="../cathen/03639a.htm">chasuble</a> by <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a> assisting at <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a>; <li>he forbade <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> to perform any of the <a href="../cathen/10001a.htm">musical</a> portions of the <a href="../cathen/09790b.htm">Mass</a> other than singing the <a href="../cathen/06659a.htm">Gospel</a>. </ul>

<p>Beyond these and some few minor points it seems impossible to conclude with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> what changes Gregory did make. As to the much-disputed question of the Gregorian Sacramentary and the almost more difficult point of his relation to the <a href="../cathen/09304a.htm">plain song or chant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for Gregory's connection with which matters the earliest authority seems to be <a href="../cathen/08491a.htm">John the Deacon</a> (Vita, II, vi, Xvii), see <a href="../cathen/06779a.htm">GREGORIAN CHANT</a>; <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">SACRAMENTARY</a>.

<p>There is no lack of evidence, however, to illustrate Gregory's activity as manager of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">patrimony of St. Peter</a>. By his day the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">estates of the Church</a> had reached vast dimensions. Varying estimates place their total area at from 1300 to 1800 square miles, and there seems no reason for supposing this to be an exaggeration, while the income arising therefrom was probably not less than $1,500,000 a year. The land lay in many places &mdash; Campania, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and elsewhere &mdash; and, as their landlord, Gregory displayed a skill in finance and estate management which excites our admiration no less than it did the surprise of his tenants and agents, who suddenly found that they had a new master who was not to be deceived or cheated.

<p>The management of each patrimony was carried out by a number of agents of varying grades and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> under an official called the <em><a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a></em> or <em>defensor</em> of the patrimony. Previously the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rectors</a> had usually been <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, but Gregory established the <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> of appointing <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> to the post. In doing this he probably had in view the many extra <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of an <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical</a> nature which he called upon them to undertake. Thus examples may be found of such <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rectors</a> being commissioned to undertake the filling up of <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>, holding of local <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, taking action against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, providing for the maintenance of <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, rectifying abuses in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> of their district, with the enforcing of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> and even the reproof and correction of local <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Still Gregory never allowed the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rectors</a> to interfere in such matters on their own responsibility.

<p>In the minutiae of estate management nothing was too small for Gregory's personal notice, from the exact number of <em>sextarii</em> in a <em>modius</em> of corn, or how many solidi went to one golden pound, to the use of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> weights by certain minor agents. He finds <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to write instructions on every detail and leaves no complaint unattended to, even from the humblest of his multitude of tenants. Throughout the large number of letters which deal with the management of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">patrimony</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> determination to secure a scrupulously righteous administration is evident. As <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he is the trustee of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a>, and his agents must show that they realize this by their conduct. Consequently, under his able management the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">estates of the Church</a> increased steadily in value, the tenants were contented, and the revenues paid in with unprecedented regularity.

<p>The only fault ever laid at his door in this <a href="../cathen/10053b.htm">matter</a> is that, by his boundless <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">charities</a>, he emptied his treasury. But this, if a fault at all, was a natural consequence of his view that he was the administrator of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, for whom he could never do enough.
<h3 id="B">Relations with the suburbicarian Churches</h3>

<p>As <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> exercise a special <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over and above their universal <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">primacy</a> as <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">successors</a> of <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a>; and among <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western churches</a>, this <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> extends in a most intimate manner over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and the isles adjacent.

<p>On the mainland much of this territory was in the hands of the Lombards, with whose <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> Gregory was, of course, not in communion. Whenever opportunity offered, however, he was careful to provide for the needs of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> in these parts, frequently uniting them to some neighboring <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, when they were too few to occupy the energies of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p>On the islands, of which <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> was by far the most important, the pre-existing <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">church</a> system was maintained. Gregory appointed a <a href="../cathen/15401a.htm">vicar</a>, usually the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">province</a>, who exercised a general supervision over the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a>. He also insisted strongly on the holding of local <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> as ordered by the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>, and letters of his exist addressed to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> reminding them of their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> in this respect.

<p>The supreme instance of Gregory's intervention in the affairs of these <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> occurs in the case of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, where the behaviour of Januarius the half-witted, aged <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">Metropolitan</a> of <a href="../cathen/03139c.htm">Cagliari</a>, had reduced the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> to a state of semi-chaos.

<p>A large number of letters relate to the reforms instituted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (Epistles <a href="../fathers/360202047.htm">2.47</a>; <a href="../fathers/360203036.htm">3.36</a>; <a href="../fathers/360204009.htm">4.9</a>; <a href="../fathers/360204023.htm">4.23-27</a>; <a href="../fathers/360204029.htm">4.29</a>; <a href="../fathers/360205002.htm">5.2</a>; <a href="../fathers/360209001.htm">9.1</a>; <a href="../fathers/360209011.htm">9.11</a>; 9.202-204; <a href="../fathers/360214002.htm">14.2</a>). His care over the <a href="../cathen/05374b.htm">election</a> of a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whenever a <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacancy</a> occurs is shown in many cases, and if, after his <a href="../cathen/05673a.htm">examination</a> of the elect, which is always a searching one, he finds him unfitted for the post, he has no hesitation in rejecting him and commanding another to be chosen (Epistles 1.15; <a href="../fathers/360201016.htm">1.16</a>; <a href="../fathers/360207038.htm">7.38</a>; 10.7).

<p>With regard to <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was specially strict in enforcing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as to the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy of the clergy</a> (Epistles <a href="../fathers/360201042.htm">1.42</a>; <a href="../fathers/360204005.htm">4.5</a>; <a href="../fathers/360204026.htm">4.26</a>; <a href="../fathers/360204034.htm">4.34</a>; 7.1; <a href="../fathers/360209110.htm">9.110</a>; 9.218; <a href="../fathers/360210019.htm">10.19</a>; <a href="../fathers/360211056.htm">11.56</a>; <a href="../fathers/360213038.htm">13.38</a>; <a href="../fathers/360213039.htm">13.39</a>); the <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">exemption</a> of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> from lay tribunals (Epistles <a href="../fathers/360201039.htm">1.39</a>; 6.11; 9.53; 9.76; <a href="../fathers/360209079.htm">9.79</a>; 10.4; <a href="../fathers/360211032.htm">11.32</a>; <a href="../fathers/360213001.htm">13.1</a>); and the <a href="../cathen/04677c.htm">deprivation</a> of all <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> guilty of criminal or <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> offences (Epistles <a href="../fathers/360201018.htm">1.18</a>; <a href="../fathers/360201042.htm">1.42</a>; <a href="../fathers/360203049.htm">3.49</a>; <a href="../fathers/360204026.htm">4.26</a>; <a href="../fathers/360205017.htm">5.17</a>; <a href="../fathers/360205018.htm">5.18</a>; <a href="../fathers/360207039.htm">7.39</a>; <a href="../fathers/360208024.htm">8.24</a>; 9.25; 12.3; 12.10; 12.11; <a href="../fathers/360214002.htm">14.2</a>). He was also inflexible with regard to the proper application of church revenues, insisting that others should be as strict as he was in disposing of these funds for their proper ends (Epistles <a href="../fathers/360201010.htm">1.10</a>; 1.64; <a href="../fathers/360202020.htm">2.20-22</a>; <a href="../fathers/360203022.htm">3.22</a>; <a href="../fathers/360204011.htm">4.11</a>; 5.12; <a href="../fathers/360205048.htm">5.48</a>; 8.7; 11.22; <a href="../fathers/360211056.htm">11.56</a>; 13.46; <a href="../fathers/360214002.htm">14.2</a>).
<h3 id="C">Relations with other Churches</h3>

<p>With regard to the other <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Churches</a> limits of space prevent any detailed account of Gregory's dealings, but the following quotation, all the more valuable as coming from a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> authority, indicates very clearly the line he followed herein:

<blockquote><p>"In his dealings with the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Churches of the West</a>, Gregory acted invariably on the assumption that all were subject to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>. Of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> claimed or exercised by his predecessors he would not abate one tittle; on the contrary, he did everything in his power to maintain, strengthen, and extend what he regarded as the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> prerogatives of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that he respected the <a href="../cathen/12436b.htm">privileges</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, and disapproved of unnecessary interference within the sphere of their <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> canonically exercised. . . . But of his general principle there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whatever" (Dudden, I, 475).</p></blockquote>

<p>In view of later developments Gregory's dealings with the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Churches</a>, and with <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a> in particular, have a special importance. There cannot be the smallest <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that Gregory claimed for the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, and for himself as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">primacy</a> not of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, but of supreme authority over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Universal</a>. In Epistle 13.50, he speaks of "the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, which is the head of all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>", and in Epistle 5.154, he says: "I, albeit unworthy, have been set up in command of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." As <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">successor of St. Peter</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had received from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">primacy</a> over all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a> (<a href="../fathers/360202046.htm">Epistle 2.46</a>; <a href="../fathers/360203030.htm">3.30</a>; 5.37; 7.37). His approval it was which gave force to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">councils or synods</a> (Epistle 9.156), and his authority could annul them (Epistles <a href="../fathers/360205039.htm">5.39</a>, <a href="../fathers/360205041.htm">5.41</a>, 5.44). To him <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appeals</a> might be made even against other <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, and by him <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were judged and corrected if need were (Epistles 2.50; 3.52; 3.63; <a href="../fathers/360209026.htm">9.26</a>; <a href="../fathers/360209027.htm">9.27</a>).

<p>This position naturally made it impossible for him to permit the use of the title Ecumenical Bishop assumed by the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a>, <a href="../cathen/08493a.htm">John the Faster</a>, at a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in 588. Gregory protested, and a long controversy followed, the question still at issue when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> died. A discussion of this controversy is needless here, but it is important as showing how completely Gregory regarded the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> as being subject to himself; "As regards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a>," he writes in <a href="../fathers/360209012.htm">Epistle 9.12</a>, "who can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that it is subject to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>? Why, both our most religious lord the emperor, and our brother the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a> continually acknowledge it."

<p>At the same time the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was most careful not to interfere with the canonical <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the other <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. With the other <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> his relations were most cordial, as appears from his <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">letters</a> to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Antioch</a> and <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>.
<h3 id="D">Relations with the Lombards and the Franks</h3>

<p>Gregory's <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> preceded by a few days only the death of Authari, King of the Lombards, whose queen, the famous Theodelinde, then <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">married</a> Agilulf, Duke of <a href="../cathen/15092d.htm">Turin</a>, a warlike and energetic prince. With Agilulf and the Dukes Ariulf of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> and Arichis of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, Gregory soon had to deal, as, when difficulties arose, Romanus, the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a>, or representative, of the emperor, preferred to remain in sulky inactivity at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>.

<p>It soon became clear that, if any successful resistance was to be made against the Lombards, it must be by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> own exertions. How keenly he felt the difficulty and danger of his position appears in some of the earliest letters (Epistles <a href="../fathers/360201003.htm">1.3</a>, 1.8, 1.30); but no actual hostilities began till the summer of 592, when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> received a threatening letter from Ariulf of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, which was followed almost immediately by the appearance of that chief before the walls of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At the same time Arichis of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a> advanced on <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, which happened at the moment to have no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> nor any officer of high rank in command of the garrison. Gregory at once took the surprising step of appointing a tribune on his own authority to take command of the city (<a href="../fathers/360202034.htm">Epistle 2.34</a>), and, when no notice of this strong action was taken by the imperial authorities, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of himself arranging a separate peace with the Lombards (Epistle 2.45). No details of this peace have come down to us, but it seems <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that it was actually concluded (<a href="../fathers/360205036.htm">Epistle 5.36</a>). Dr. Hodgkin (Italy and her Invaders, v, 366) pronounces Gregory's action herein to have been wise and statesmanlike, but, at the same time, undoubtedly <em>ultra vires</em>, being quite beyond any legal competency then possessed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who thus "made a memorable stride towards complete independence".

<p>Gregory's independent action had the effect of rousing up Romanus the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a>. Wholly ignoring the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> peace, he gathered all his troops, attacked and regained <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, and then marched to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was received with imperial <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honours</a>. The next spring, however, he quitted the city and took away its garrison with him, so that both <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and citizens were now more exasperated against him than before. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch's</a> campaign had roused the Northern Lombards, and King Agilulf marched on <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, arriving there probably some <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> in June, 593. The terror aroused by his advance is still mirrored for us in Gregory's <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> on the <a href="../cathen/05737b.htm">Prophet Ezechiel</a>, which were delivered at this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. The siege of the city was soon abandoned, however, and Agilulf retired. The continuator of <a href="../cathen/12487a.htm">Prosper</a> (Mon. Germ. SS. Antiq., IX, 339) relates that Agilulf met the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in person on the steps of the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Basilica of St. Peter</a>, which was then outside the city walls, and "being melted by Gregory's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and greatly moved by the wisdom and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">religious</a> gravity of this great man, he broke up the siege of the city"; but, in view of the silence both of Gregory himself and of <a href="../cathen/11591b.htm">Paul the Deacon</a> on the point, the story seems scarcely probable. In <a href="../fathers/360205039.htm">Epistle 5.39</a>, Gregory refers to himself as "the paymaster of the Lombards", and most likely a large payment from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> treasury was the chief inducement to raise the siege.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> great desire now was to secure a lasting peace with the Lombards, which could only be achieved by a proper arrangement between the imperial authorities and the Lombard chiefs. On Queen Theodelinde, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and a personal friend, Gregory placed all his hopes. The <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a>, however, looked at the whole affair in another light, and, when a whole year was passed in fruitless negotiations, Gregory began once again to mediate a private treaty. Accordingly, in May, 595, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> wrote to a friend at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> a <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">letter</a> (Epistle 5.34) threatening to make peace with Agilulf even without the <a href="../cathen/04283a.htm">consent</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">Exarch</a> Romanus. This threat was speedily reported to <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> was in high favour, and the <a href="../cathen/10069a.htm">Emperor Maurice</a> at once sent off to Gregory a <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violent</a> <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">letter</a>, now lost, accusing him of being both a <a href="../cathen/15026b.htm">traitor</a> and a fool. This letter Gregory received in June, 595. Luckily, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> answer has been preserved to us (<a href="../fathers/360205036.htm">Epistle 5.36</a>). It must be read in its entirety to be appreciated fully; probably very few emperors, if any, have ever received such a letter from a subject. Still, in spite of his scathing reply, Gregory seems to have realized that independent action could not secure what he wished, and we hear no more about a separate peace.

<p>Gregory's relations with the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">Exarch</a> Romanus became continually more and more strained until the latter's death in the year 596 or early in 597. The new <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a>, Callinicus, was a man of far greater ability and well disposed towards the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, whose hopes now revived. The official peace negotiations were pushed on, and, in spite of delays, the articles were at length signed in 599, to Gregory's great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. This peace lasted two years, but in 601 the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> broke out again through an aggressive act on the part of Callinicus, who was recalled two years later, when his successor, Smaragdus, again made a peace with the Lombards which endured until after Gregory's death.

<p>Two points stand out for special notice in Gregory's dealings with the Lombards: first, his determination that, in spite of the apathy of the imperial authorities, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> should not pass into the hands of some half-civilized Lombard duke and so sink into insignificance and decay; second, his independent action in appointing governors to cities, providing munitions of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, giving instructions to generals, sending ambassadors to the Lombard king, and even negotiating a peace without the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch's</a> aid. Whatever the theory may have been, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about the fact that, besides his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a>, Gregory actually exercised no small amount of temporal power.

<p>Of Gregory's relations with the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> there is no need to write at length, as the intercourse he established with the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kings practically lapsed at his death, and was not renewed for about a hundred years. On the other hand he exercised a great influence on <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monasticism</a>, which he did much to strengthen and reshape, so that the work done by the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in civilizing the wild <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> may be attributed ultimately to the first <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>-<a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.
<h3 id="E">Relations with the Imperial Government</h3>

<p>The reign of Gregory the Great marks an epoch in <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history</a>, and this is specially the case in respect to his attitude towards the imperial Government centered at <a href="../cathen/04301a.htm">Constantinople</a>. Gregory seems to have looked upon <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> as co-operating to form a united whole, which acted in two distinct spheres, ecclesiastical and secular. Over this commonwealth were the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the emperor, each supreme in his own department, care being taken to keep these as far as possible distinct and independent.

<p>The latter point was the difficulty. Gregory definitely held that it was a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the secular ruler to protect the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and preserve the "peace of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" (Mor., XXXI, viii), and so he is often found to call in the aid of the secular arm, not merely to suppress <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, but even to enforce <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> among <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (Epistles 1.72; 2.29; 3.59; 4.7; 4.32; 5.32; 8.4; 11.12; 11.37; 13.36). If the emperor interfered in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">church</a> matters the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> policy was to acquiesce if possible, unless <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> was <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a>, according to the principle laid down in <a href="../fathers/360211029.htm">Epistle 11.29</a>; "Quod ipse [se imperator] fecerit, si canonicum est, sequimur; si vero canonicum non est, in quantum sine peccato nostro, portamus." In taking this line Gregory was undoubtedly influenced by his deep reverence for the emperor, whom he regarded as the representative of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in all things secular, and must still be treated with all possible respect, even when he encroached on the borders of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority.

<p>On his side, although he certainly regarded himself as "superior in place and rank" to the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> (Epistle 2.14), Gregory objected strongly to the interference of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authorities in matters secular. As supreme guardian of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was always ready to intercede for, or protect anyone who suffered <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> treatment (Epistles <a href="../fathers/360201035.htm">1.35</a>; <a href="../fathers/360201036.htm">1.36</a>; <a href="../fathers/360201047.htm">1.47</a>; 1.59; <a href="../fathers/360203005.htm">3.5</a>; 5.38; <a href="../fathers/360209004.htm">9.4</a>; 9.46; <a href="../fathers/360209055.htm">9.55</a>; 9.113; 9.182; 11.4), but at the same time he used the utmost tact in approaching the imperial officials. In <a href="../fathers/360201039.htm">Epistle 1.39</a>, xxxix a, he explains for the benefit of his <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> agent the precise attitude to be adopted in such matters.

<p>Still, in conjunction with all this deference, Gregory retained a spirit of independence which enabled him, when he considered it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, to address even the emperor in terms of startling directness. Space makes it impossible to do more than refer to the famous <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">letters</a> to the Emperor Phocas on his usurpation and the allusions in them to the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> <a href="../cathen/10069a.htm">Emperor Maurice</a> (Epistles <a href="../fathers/360213034.htm">13.34</a>, <a href="../fathers/360213041.htm">13.41</a>, <a href="../fathers/360213042.htm">13.42</a>). Every kind of judgement has been passed upon Gregory for writing these <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">letters</a>, but the question remains a difficult one. Probably the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> conduct herein was due to two things: first, his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the way in which Phocus had reached the throne; and second, his view that the emperor was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> representative on earth, and therefore deserving of all possible respect in his official capacity, his personal <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> not coming into the question at all. It should be noted, also, that he avoids any direct flattery towards the new emperor, merely using the exaggerated phrases of respect then customary, and expressing the high hopes he entertains of the new regime. Moreover, his allusions to <a href="../cathen/10069a.htm">Maurice</a> refer to the sufferings of the people under his government, and do not reflect on the dead emperor himself.

<p>Had the empire been sound instead of in a hopelessly rotten state when Gregory became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, it is hard to say how his views might have worked out in practice. As it was, his line of strong independence, his efficiency, and his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> carried all before them, and when he died there was no longer any question as to who was the first power in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.
<h3 id="F">Missionary work</h3>

<p>Gregory's <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and in particular of the <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">Angles</a>, has been mentioned already, and there is no need to dwell at length on the latter subject, as it has been fully treated under <a href="../cathen/02081a.htm">SAINT AUGUSTINE OF CANTERBURY</a>. In <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to the great <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, however, it must be added that he lost no opportunity for the exercise of his missionary <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, making every effort to root out <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatism</a> in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">Schism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14707b.htm">Three Chapters</a> in North <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and Istria.

<p>In his treatment of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatics</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> his method was to try every means &mdash; persuasions, exhortations, threats &mdash; before resorting to force; but, if gentler treatment failed, he had no hesitation in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of his age, in resorting to compulsion, and invoking the aid of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular arm</a> therein. It is curious, therefore, to find him acting as a champion and protector of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. In Epistle 1.14, he expressly deprecates the compulsory <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and many instances appear in which he insists on their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to liberty of action, so far as the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> permitted, both in civil affairs and in the worship of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> (Epistles <a href="../fathers/360201034.htm">1.34</a>; <a href="../fathers/360202006.htm">2.6</a>; 8.25; 9.38; 9.195; 13.15). He was equally strong, however, in preventing the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> from exceeding the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> granted to them by the imperial <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, especially with regard to the ownership by them of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slaves</a> (Epistles <a href="../fathers/360202006.htm">2.6</a>; 3.37; <a href="../fathers/360204009.htm">4.9</a>; <a href="../fathers/360204021.htm">4.21</a>; <a href="../fathers/360206029.htm">6.29</a>; 7.21; <a href="../fathers/360208021.htm">8.21</a>; 9.104; 9.213; 9.215). We shall probably be <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a>, therefore, in attributing Gregory's protection of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to his respect for <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, rather than to any <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="../cathen/14761a.htm">toleration</a> differing from those current at the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>.
<h3 id="G">Gregory and monasticism</h3>

<p>Although the first <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> to become <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Gregory was in no sense an original contributor to <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> ideals or practice. He took <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monasticism</a> as he found it established by <a href="../cathen/02467b.htm">St. Benedict</a>, and his efforts and influence were given to strengthening and enforcing the prescriptions of that greatest of <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> legislators. His position did indeed tend to modify <a href="../cathen/02467b.htm">St. Benedict's</a> work by drawing it into a closer connection with the organization of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> in particular, but this was not deliberately aimed at by Gregory. Rather he was himself convinced that the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> system had a very special value for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and so he did everything in his power to diffuse and propagate it. His own <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to this end, he urged many <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> people to establish or support <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and he used the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">patrimony</a> for the same purpose.

<p>He was relentless in correcting abuses and enforcing <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a>, the letters on such matters being far too numerous for mention here, and the points on which he insists most are precisely those, such as stability and <a href="../cathen/12324a.htm">poverty</a>, on which <a href="../cathen/02467b.htm">St. Benedict's</a> recent legislation had laid special stress. Twice only do we find anything like direct legislation by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The first point is that of the age at which a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> might be made <a href="../cathen/01007e.htm">abbess</a>, which he fixes at "not less than sixty years" (<a href="../fathers/360204011.htm">Epistle 4.11</a>). The second is his lengthening of the period of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. <a href="../cathen/02467b.htm">St. Benedict</a> had prescribed at least one year (Reg. Ben., lviii); Gregory (Epistle 10.9) orders two years, with special precautions in the case of <a href="../cathen/14036a.htm">slaves</a> who wished to become <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>.

<p>More important was his line of action in the difficult question of the relation between <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. There is plenty of evidence to show that many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> took advantage of their position to oppress and burden the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, with the result that the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appealed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for protection. Gregory, while always upholding the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was firm in support of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> against any illegal aggression. All attempts on the part of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to assume new powers over the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> were condemned, while at times the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> issued documents, called Privilegia, in which he definitely set forth certain points on which the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were exempt from <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopal</a> control (Epistles <a href="../fathers/360205049.htm">5.49</a>; <a href="../fathers/360207012.htm">7.12</a>; <a href="../fathers/360208017.htm">8.17</a>; 12.11; 12.12; 12.13). This action on Gregory's part undoubtedly began the long progress by which the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> bodies have come to be under the direct control of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>It should be mentioned that in Gregory's day the current view was that <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical</a> work, such as the <a href="../cathen/04572a.htm">cure of souls</a>, preaching, administering the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, etc., was not compatible with the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> state, and in this view the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> concurred. On the other hand a passage in Epistle 12.4, where he directs that a certain <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> "should be <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsured</a> either as a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> or a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>", would suggest that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> held the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> state as in some way equivalent to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical</a>; for his ultimate <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a> in this case was to promote the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> in question to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a>.
<h3 id="H">Death, canonization, relics, emblem</h3>

<p>The last years of Gregory's life were filled with every kind of suffering. His <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, naturally serious, was filled with despondent forebodings, and his continued bodily pains were increased and intensified. His "sole consolation was the <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> that death would come quickly" (<a href="../fathers/360213026.htm">Epistle 13.26</a>). The end came on 12 March, 604, and on the same day his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">body</a> was laid to rest in front of the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">portico</a> of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's Basilica</a>. Since then the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> have been moved several times, the most recent translation being that by <a href="../cathen/11581b.htm">Paul V</a> in 1606, when they were placed in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of <a href="../cathen/04020a.htm">Clement V</a> near the entrance of the modern <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>. There is some evidence that the body was taken to <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the year 826, but probably only some large <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relic</a> is meant.

<p><a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> (Hist. Eccl., II, i) gives the epitaph placed on his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> which contains the famous phrase referring to Gregory as <em>consul Dei</em>. His <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> by popular <a href="../cathen/01097a.htm">acclamation</a> followed at once on his death, and survived a reaction against his memory which seems to have occurred soon afterwards.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">art</a> the great <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is usually shown in full <a href="../cathen/12231b.htm">pontifical</a> robes with the <a href="../cathen/14714c.htm">tiara</a> and double <a href="../cathen/04517a.htm">cross</a>. A <a href="../cathen/05144b.htm">dove</a> is his special emblem, in allusion to the well-known story recorded by <a href="../cathen/11783c.htm">Peter the Deacon</a> (Vita, xxviii), who tells that when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was dictating his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">homilies</a> on <a href="../bible/eze000.htm">Ezechiel</a> a veil was drawn between his secretary and himself. As, however, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> remained silent for long periods at a time, the servant made a hole in the curtain and, looking through, beheld a <a href="../cathen/05144b.htm">dove</a> seated upon Gregory's head with its beak between his lips. When the <a href="../cathen/05144b.htm">dove</a> withdrew its beak the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pontiff</a> spoke and the secretary took down his words; but when he became silent the servant again applied his eye to the hole and saw the <a href="../cathen/05144b.htm">dove</a> had replaced its beak between his lips. The <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> attributed to Gregory are very many, but space forbids even the barest catalogue of them.
<h3 id="I">Conclusion</h3>

<p>It is beyond the scope of this notice to attempt any elaborate estimate of the work, influence, and <a href="../cathen/03584b.htm">character</a> of Pope Gregory the Great, but some short focusing of the features given above is only just.

<p>First of all, perhaps, it will be best to clear the ground by admitting frankly what Gregory was not. He was not a man of profound learning, not a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, not a conversationalist, hardly even a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> in the constructive sense of the term. He was a trained Roman lawyer and administrator, a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, a missionary, a preacher, above all a physician of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and a leader of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. His great claim to remembrance lies in the fact that he is the real father of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> (Milman).

<p>With regard to things spiritual, he impressed upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> to a degree unprecedented the fact that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">See of Peter</a> was the one supreme, decisive authority in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. During his pontificate, he established close relations between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and those of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, and Illyricum, while his influence in Britain was such that he is justly called the Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">English</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a>, too, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority was exercised with a frequency unusual before his <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>, and we find no less an authority than the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a> submitting himself humbly to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> "commands". The system of <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appeals</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was firmly established, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is found to veto or confirm the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> of <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, to annul the decisions of <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, and inflict punishment on <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignitaries</a> precisely as he thinks right.

<p>Nor is his work less noteworthy in its effect on the temporal position of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. Seizing the opportunity which circumstances offered, he made himself in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> a power stronger than emperor or <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a>, and established a political influence which dominated the peninsula for centuries. From this <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> forth the varied populations of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> looked to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for guidance, and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> capital continued to be the centre of the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a>.

<p>Gregory's work as a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> and <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a> is less notable. In the history of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> development he is important as summing up the teaching of the earlier <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> and consolidating it into a harmonious whole, rather than as introducing new developments, new methods, new solutions of difficult questions. It was precisely because of this that his writings became to a great extent the <em>compendium theologiae</em> or textbook of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, a position for which his work in popularizing his great predecessors fitted him well. Achievements so varied have won for Gregory the title of "the Great", but perhaps, among our English-speaking races, he is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> most of all as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> the bright-faced <a href="../cathen/01505a.htm">Angles</a>, and taught them first to sing the <a href="../cathen/06583a.htm">Angels' song</a>.
<h2>His writings</h2>
<h3>Genuine, doubtful, spurious</h3>

<p>Of the writings commonly attributed to Gregory the following are now admitted as genuine on all hands: "Moralium Libri XXXV"; "Regulae Pastoralis Liber"; "Dialogorum Libri IV"; "Homiliarum in Ezechielem Prophetam Libri II"; "Homiliarum in Evangelia Libri II"; "Epistolarum Libri XIV". The following are almost certainly spurious: "In Librum Primum Regum Variarum Expositionum Libri VI"; "expositio super Cantica Canticorum"; "Expositio in VII Psalmos Poenitentiales"; "Concordia Quorundam Testimoniorum S. Scripturae". Besides the above there are attributed to Gregory certain <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, the Gregorian Sacramentary, and the <a href="../cathen/01576b.htm">Antiphonary</a>. (See <a href="../cathen/01576b.htm">ANTIPHONARY</a>; <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">SACRAMENTARY</a>.)

<div class="cenotes"><h2>Sources</h2><p class="cenotes">CHIEF SOURCES.&mdash;First of all come the writings of Gregory himself, of which a full account is given above, the most important from a biographical point of view being the fourteen books of his Letters and the four books of Dialogues. The other early authorities are ST. GREGORY OF TOURS (d. 594 or 595), Historia Francorum, Bk. X, and the Liber Pontificalis, both practically contemporary. To the seventh century belong ST. ISIDORE OF SEVILLE. De Viris Illustribus, XL, and ST. ILDEPHONSUS OF TOLEDO, De Viris Illustribus, I. Next come the Vita Antiquissima, by an anonymous monk of Whitby, written probably about 713, and of special interest as representing an essentially English tradition in regard to the saint; THE VEN. BEDE, Hist. Eccles., II, whose work was finished in 731; PAUL THE DEACON, who compiled a short Vita Gregorii Magni between 770 and 780, which may be supplemented from the same writers more famous work Historia Longobardorum; lastly JOHN THE DEACON, who, at the request of John VIII (872-882), produced his Vita Gregorii in answer to the complaint that no history of the saint had yet been produced in Rome. Besides these direct authorities considerable light on the period of St. Gregory's life may be gathered from the works of various contemporary chroniclers and historians. <br>WORKS ON GREGORY. &mdash; (1) General. &mdash; GREGORY OF TOURS, Historia Francorum, X, i, in P.L., LXXI; the best edition of this is by ARNDT AND KRUSCH in Mon.
