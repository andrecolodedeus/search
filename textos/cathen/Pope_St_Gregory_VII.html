<h1>Pope St. Gregory VII</h1>  

<p>(HILDEBRAND).

<p>One of the greatest of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiffs</a> and one of the most remarkable <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of all times; born between the years 1020 and 1025, at Soana, or Ravacum, in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>; died 25 May, 1085, at <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a>.

<p>The early years of his life are involved in considerable obscurity. His name, Hildebrand (Hellebrand)--signifying to those of his contemporaries that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him "a bright flame", to those that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> him "a brand of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>"--would indicate some Lombard connection of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, though at a later time, it probably also suggested the fabled descent from the noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Aldobrandini. That he was of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> origin--vir de plebe, as he is styled in the letter of a contemporary <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>--can scarcely be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>. His father Bonizo is said by some chroniclers to have been a carpenter, by others a peasant, the evidence in either case being very slender; the name of his mother is unrecorded. At a tender age he came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> on the Aventine Hill, over which his maternal uncle Laurentius presided as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. The austere spirit of Cluny pervaded this Roman <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, and it is not unlikely that here the youthful Hildebrand first imbibed those lofty principles of Church reform of which he was afterwards to become the most fearless exponent. Early in life he made his <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> as a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (not in Cluny); the house of his profession, however, and the year of his entrance into the order, both remain undetermined. As a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> in <a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a> he entered the service of John Gratian, Archpriest of San Giovanni by the Latin Gate, and on Gratian's elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> as <a href="../cathen/06791b.htm">Gregory VI</a>, became his <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a>. In 1046 he followed his <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> patron across the Alps into exile, remaining with <a href="../cathen/06791b.htm">Gregory</a> at Cologne until the death of the deposed pontiff in 1047, when he withdrew to Cluny. Here he resided for more than a year.

<p>At <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>, in January, 1049, he met Bruno, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toul, the pontiff-elect recently chosen at Worms under the title of <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a>, and returned with him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, though not before Bruno, who had been nominated merely by the emperor, had expressed the intention of submitting to the formal choice of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people. Created a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal-subdeacon</a>, shortly after Leo's accession, and appointed administrator of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Patrimony of St. Peter's</a>, Hildebrand at once gave evidence of that extraordinary faculty for administration which later characterized his government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Universal. Under his energetic and capable direction the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>, which latterly had been diverted into the hands of the Roman nobility and the Normans, was largely recovered, and the revenues of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, whose treasury had been depleted, speedily augmented. By <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> he was also appointed propositus or promisor (not <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>) of the <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">monastery of St. Paul extra Muros</a>. The unchecked <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the lawless bands of the Champagne had brought great destitution upon this venerable establishment. Monastic discipline was so impaired that the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were attended in their refectory by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; and the sacred edifices were so neglected that the sheep and cattle freely roamed in and out through the broken doors. By rigorous reforms and a wise administration Hildebrand succeeded in restoring the ancient rule of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> with the austere observance of earlier times; and he continued throughout life to manifest the deepest attachment for the famous house which his energy had reclaimed from ruin and decay. In 1054 he was sent to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to examine the cause of <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a>. While still in Tours he learned of the death of <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a>, and on hastening back to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he found that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people were eager to elect him, the most trusted friend and counsellor of Leo, as the successor. This proposal of the Romans was, however, resisted by Hildebrand, who set out for <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> at the head of an embassy to implore a <a href="../cathen/11093a.htm">nomination</a> from the emperor. The negotiations, which lasted about eleven months, ultimately resulted in the selection of Hildebrand's candidate, Gebhard, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Eichstadt, who was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 13 April, 1055, under the name of Victor II. During the reign of this pontiff, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#d">cardinal-subdeacon</a> steadily maintained, and even increased the ascendancy which by his commanding genius he had acquired during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a>. Near the close of the year 1057 he went once more to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> to reconcile the Empress-regent Agnes and her court to the (merely) canonical election of <a href="../cathen/14290c.htm">Pope Stephen X</a> (1057-1058). His mission was not yet accomplished when Stephen died at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, and although the dying <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had forbidden the people to appoint a successor before Hildebrand returned, the Tusculan faction seized the opportunity to set up a member of the <a href="../cathen/04484c.htm">Crescentian family</a>, John Mincius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Velletri</a>, under the title of <a href="../cathen/02429b.htm">Benedict X</a>. With masterly skill Hildebrand succeeded in defeating the schemes of the hostile party, and secured the election of Gerard, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03068a.htm">Burgundian</a> by birth, who assumed the name of <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a> (1059-1061).

<p>The two most important transactions of this pontificate--the celebrated <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of election, by which the power of choosing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was vested in the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">college of cardinals</a>, and the alliance with the Normans, secured by the Treaty of Meifi, 1059--were in large measure the achievement of Hildebrand, whose power and influence had now become supreme in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It was perhaps inevitable that the issues raised by the new <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of election should not be decided without a conflict, and with the passing away of <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a> in 1061, that conflict came. But when it was ended, after a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> enduring for some years, the imperial party with its <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/03128c.htm">Cadalous</a> had been discomfited, and Anselm of Baggio, the candidate of Hildebrand and the reform party, successfully <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> in the Lateran Palace as <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a>. By <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a>, in 1059, Hildebrand had been raised to the dignity and office of <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy Roman Church</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a> now made him Chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. On 21 April, 1073, <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a> died. The time at length had come when Hildebrand, who for more than twenty years had been the most prominent figure in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who had been chiefly instrumental in the selection of her rulers, who had inspired and given purpose to her policy, and who had been steadily developing and realizing, by successive acts, her sovereignty and purity, should assume in his own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> the majesty and responsibility of that exalted power which his genius had so long directed.



<p>On the day following the death of <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a>, as the obsequies of the deceased pontiff were being performed in the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran basilica</a>, there arose, of a sudden, a loud outcry from the whole multitude of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people: "Let Hildebrand be <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>!" "Blessed Peter has chosen Hildebrand the Archdeacon!" All remonstrances on the part of the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> were vain, his protestations fruitless. Later, on the same day, Hildebrand was conducted to the church of San Pietro in Vincoli, and there elected in legal form by the assembled <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, with the due consent of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and amid the repeated acclamations of the people. That this extraordinary outburst on the part of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people in favour of Hildebrand could have been the result of some preconcerted arrangements, as is sometimes alleged, does not appear likely. Hildebrand was clearly the man of the hour, his austere <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> commanded respect, his genius admiration; and the prompitude and unanimity with which he was chosen would indicate, rather, a general recognition of his fitness for the high office. In the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of election those who had chosen him as pontiff proclaimed him "a devout man, a man mighty in human and divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, a distinguished lover of equity and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, a man firm in adversity and temperate in prosperity, a man, according to the saying of the Apostle, of good behaviour, blameless, modest, sober, chaste, given to hospitality, and one that ruleth well his own house; a man from his childhood generously brought up in the bosom of this Mother Church, and for the merit of his life already raised to the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archidiaconal</a> dignity". "We choose then", they said to the people, "our Archdeacon Hildebrand to be <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and successor to the Apostle, and to bear henceforward and forever the name of Gregory" (22 April, 1073), <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Conciliorum Collectio", XX, 60.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a> having expressly, if vaguely acknowledged the right of the emperor to have some voice in papal elections, Hildebrand deferred the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> until he had received the royal sanction. In sending the formal announcement of his elevation to Henry IV of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, he took occasion to indicate frankly the attitude, which, as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a>, he was prepared to assume in dealing with the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes, and, with a note of grave personal warning besought the king not to bestow his approval. The German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, apprehensive of the severity with which such a man as Hildebrand would carry out the decrees of reform, endeavoured to prevent the king from assenting to the election; but upon the favourable report of Count Eberhard of Nettenburg, who had been dispatched to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to assert the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the crown, Henry gave his approval (it proved to be the last instance in history of a papal election being ratified by an emperor), and the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in the meanwhile <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on the Feast of Sts. Peter and Paul, 29 June, 1073. In assuming the name of Gregory VII, Hildebrand not only <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> the memory and character of his earliest patron, <a href="../cathen/06791b.htm">Gregory VI</a>, but also proclaimed to the world the legitimacy of that pontiff's title.

<p>From the letters which Gregory addressed to his friends shortly after his election, imploring their intercession with <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> in his behalf, and begging their sympathy and support, it is abundantly evident that he assumed the burden of the pontificate, which had been thrust on him, only with the strongest reluctance, and not without a great struggle of mind. To Desiderius, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, he speaks of his elevation in terms of terror, giving utterance to the words of the Psalmist: "I am come into deep waters, so that the floods run over me"; "Fearlessness and trembling are come upon me, and darkness hath covered me." And in view of the appalling nature of the task that lay before him (of its difficulties no one indeed had a clearer perception than he), it cannot appear strange that even his intrepid spirit was for the moment overwhelmed. For at the time of Gregory's elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> the <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christian world</a> was in a deplorable condition. During the desolating era of transition--that terrible period of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> and rapine, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and corruption in high places, which followed immediately upon the dissolution of the <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> Empire, a period when <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and all existing institutions seemed doomed to utter destruction and ruin--the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had not been able to escape from the general debasement. The tenth century, the saddest, perhaps, in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> annals, is characterized by the vivid remark of <a href="../cathen/02304b.htm">Baronius</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was as if asleep in the vessel of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. At the time of <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX's</a> election in 1049, according to the testimony of <a href="../cathen/03014a.htm">St. Bruno</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Sengi, the whole world lay in wickedness, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> had disappeared, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> had perished and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> had been buried; <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> lording it over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were given to luxury and fornication" (Vita S. Leonis PP. IX in Watterich, Pont. Roman, Vitae, I, 96). <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a>, the fiercest censor of his age, unrolls a frightful picture of the decay of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> morality in the lurid pages of his "Liber Gomorrhianus" (Book of Gomorrha). Though allowance must no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> be made for the writer's exaggerated and rhetorical style--a style common to all moral censors-- yet the evidence derived from other sources justifies us in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that the corruption was widespread. In writing to his <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> friend, Abbot Hugh of Cluny (Jan., 1075), Gregory himself laments the unhappy state of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the following terms: "The <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> has fallen away from the Faith and is now assailed on every side by infidels. Wherever I turn my eyes--to the west, to the north, or to the south--I find everywhere <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who have obtained their office in an irregular way, whose lives and conversation are strangely at variance with their sacred calling; who go through their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> not for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ but from motives of worldly gain. There are no longer princes who set <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> before their own selfish ends, or who allow <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to stand in the way of their <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>. . . .And those among whom I live--Romans, <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombards</a>, and Normans--are, as I have often told them, worse than <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Pagans</a>" (Greg. VII, Registr., 1.II, ep. xlix).

<p>But whatever the personal feelings and anxieties of Gregory may have been in taking up the burden of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> at a time when <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandals</a> and abuses were everywhere pressing into view, the fearless pontiff felt not a moment's hesitation as to the performance of his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> in carrying out the work of reform already begun by his predecessors. Once securely established on the Apostolic throne, Gregory made every effort to stamp out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the two consuming evils of the age, <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> incontinency, and, with characteristic energy and vigor, laboured unceasingly for the assertion of those lofty principles with which he firmly believed the welfare of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christ's Church</a> and the regeneration of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> itself to be inseparably bound up. His first care, naturally, was to secure his own position in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. For this purpose he made a journey into Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, a few months after his election, and concluded treaties with Landolfo of <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>, Richard of Capun, and Gisolfo of Salerno, by which these princes engaged themselves to defend the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and never to invest anyone with a <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">church benefice</a> without the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sanction. The Norman leader, <a href="../cathen/07072b.htm">Robert Guiscard</a>, however, maintained a suspicious attitude towards the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and at the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> Synod (1075) Gregory solemnly <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him for his sacrilegious invasion of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">territory of the Holy See</a> (Capun and <a href="../cathen/02477b.htm">Benevento</a>). During the year 1074 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> mind was also greatly occupied by the project of an expedition to the East for the deliverance of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Oriental Christians</a> from the oppression of the Seljuk <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. To promote the cause of a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>, and to effect, if possible, a reunion between the Eastern and the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a>--hopes of which had been held out by the Emperor Michael VIII in his letter to Gregory in 1073--the pontiff sent the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> to Constantinople as his envoy. He wrote to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes, urging them to rally the hosts of <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Christendom</a> for the defense of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Christian East</a>; and in March, 1074, addressed a circular letter to all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, exhorting them to come to the rescue of their Eastern brethren. But the project met with much indifference and even opposition; and as Gregory himself soon became involved in complications elsewhere, which demanded all his energies, he was prevented from giving effect to his intentions, and the expedition came to naught. With the youthful monarch of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> Gregory's relations in the beginning of his pontificate were of a pacific nature. Henry, who was at the time hard pressed by the Saxons, had written to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (Sept., 1073) in a tone of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> deference, acknowledging his past misconduct, and expressing regret for his numerous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">misdeeds</a>--his invasion of the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>, his <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> promotions of unworthy <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, his negligence in punishing offenders; he promised amendment for the future, professed submission to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> in language more gentle and lowly than had ever been used by any of his predecessors to the pontiffs of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and expressed the hope that the royal power and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a>, bound together by the necessity of mutual assistance, might henceforth remain indissolubly united. But the passionate and headstrong king did not long abide by these sentiments.

<p>With admirable discernment, Gregory began his great work of purifying the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by a reformation of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. At his first <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> Synod (March, 1074) he enacted the following decrees: <ul> <li>That <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who had obtained any grade or office of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">sacred orders</a> by payment should cease to minister in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <li>That no one who had purchased any church should retain it, and that no one for the future should be permitted to buy or sell <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. <li>That all who were guilty of incontinence should cease to exercise their sacred ministry. <li>That the people should reject the ministrations of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who failed to obey these injunctions. </ul> Similar decrees had indeed been passed by previous <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and councils. <a href="../cathen/04017a.htm">Clement II</a>, <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a>, <a href="../cathen/11055a.htm">Nicholas II</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01286a.htm">Alexander II</a> had renewed the ancient <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of discipline, and made determined efforts to have them enforced. But they met with vigorous resistance, and were but partially successful. The <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> of Gregory's measures now, however, called forth a most violent storm of opposition throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. And the reason for this opposition on the part of the vast throng of immoral and <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> is not far to seek. Much of the reform thus far accomplished had been brought about mainly through the efforts of Gregory; all countries had felt the force of his will, the power of his dominant <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>. His character, therefore, was a sufficient guarantee that his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a> would not be suffered to remain a dead letter. In <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, particularly, the enactments of Gregory aroused a feeling of intense indignation. The whole body of the married <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> offered the most resolute resistance, and declared that the canon enjoining <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> was wholly unwarranted in Scripture. In support of their position they appealed to the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, <a href="../bible/1co007.htm#vrs2">1 Corinthians 7:2</a> and <a href="../bible/1co007.htm#vrs9">7:9</a>: "It is better to marry than to be burnt"; and <a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#vrs2">1 Timothy 3:2</a>: "It behooveth therefore a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to be blameless, the husband of one wife." They cited the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs11">Matthew 19:11</a>: "All men take not this word, but they to whom it is given"; and, recurred to the address of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Bishop Paphnutius at the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nice</a>. At <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a> they informed the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> that they would rather renounce their <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> than their wives, and that he for whom men were not good enough might go seek <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to preside over the Churches. Siegfried, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> and <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">Primate</a> of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, when forced to <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgate</a> the decrees, attempted to temporize, and allowed his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> six months of delay for consideration. The order, of course, remained ineffectual after the lapse of that period, and at a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at Erfurt in October, 1074, he could accomplish nothing. Altmann, the energetic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a>, nearly lost his life in publishing the measures, but adhered firmly to the instructions of the pontiff. The greater number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> received their instructions with manifest indifference, and some openly defied the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Otto of Constance, who had before tolerated the marriage of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, now formally sanctioned it. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the excitement was scarcely less vehement than in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. A council at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in 1074, condemned the Roman decrees, as implying that the validity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> depended on the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the minister, and declared them intolerable and irrational. John, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, while endeavouring to enforce the canon of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a> at a provincial synod, was stoned and had to flee for his life. Walter, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Pontoise, who attempted to defend the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> enactments, was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and threatened with death. At the Council of <a href="../cathen/03065c.htm">Burgos</a>, in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> was insulted and his dignity outraged. But the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of Gregory <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no abatement. He followed up his decrees by sending <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> into all quarters, fully empowered to depose immoral and <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>.

<p>It was clear that the causes of the <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and of the incontinence amongst the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were closely allied, and that the spread of the latter could be effectually checked only by the eradication of the former. Henry IV had failed to translate into action the promises made in his penitent letter to the new pontiff. On the subjugation of the Saxons and Thuringians, he deposed the Saxon <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and replaced them by his own creatures. In 1075 a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> "any person, even if he were emperor or king, who should confer an investiture in connection with any ecclesiastical office", and Gregory recognizing the futility of milder measures, deposed the <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> appointed by Henry, <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> several of the imperial counsellors, and cited the emperor himself to appear at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1076 to answer for his conduct before a council. To this Henry retorted by convening a meeting of his supporters at Worms on 23 January 1076. This diet naturally defended Henry against all the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> charges, accused the pontiff of most heinous crimes, and declared him deposed. Theses decisions were approved a few weeks later by two <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of Lombard <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/12069a.htm">Piacenza</a> and Pavia respectively, and a messenger, bearing a most offensive personal letter from Henry, was dispatched with this reply to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Gregory hesitated no longer: recognizing that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a> must be preserved and the flood of immorality stemmed at all costs, and seeing that the conflict was forced upon him by the emperor's <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and the violation of his solemn promises, he <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Henry and all his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> supporters, and released his subjects from their <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of allegiance in accordance with the usual political procedures of the age.

<p>Henry's position was now precarious. At first he was encouraged by his creatures to resist, but his friends, including his abettors among the episcopate, began to abandon him, and the Saxons revolted once more, demanding a new king. At a meeting of the German lords, spiritual and temporal, held at <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tibur</a> in October, 1076, the election of a new emperor was canvassed. On learning through the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> of Gregory's desire that the crown should be reserved for Henry if possible, the assembly contented itself with calling upon the emperor to abstain for the time being from all administration of public affairs and avoid the company of those who had been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, but declared his crown forfeited if he were not reconciled with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> within a year. It was further agreed to invite Gregory to a council at <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a> in the following February, at which Henry was summoned to present himself. Abandoned by his own partisans and fearing for his throne, Henry fled secretly with his wife and child and a single servant to Gregory to tender his submission. He crossed the Alps in the depth of one of the severest winters on record. On reaching <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italians</a> flocked around him promising aid and assistance in his quarrel with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but Henry spurned their offers. Gregory was already on his way to <a href="../cathen/02073b.htm">Augsburg</a>, and, fearing treachery, retired to the castle of <a href="../cathen/03298a.htm">Canossa</a>. Thither Henry followed him, but the pontiff, mindful of his former faithlessness, treated him with extreme severity. Stripped of his royal robes, and clad as a penitent, Henry had to come barefooted mid ice and snow, and crave for admission to the presence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. All day he remained at the door of the citadel, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and exposed to the inclemency of the wintry weather, but was refused admission. A second and a third day he thus humiliated and disciplined himself, and finally on 28 January, 1077, he was received by the pontiff and absolved from censure, but only on condition that he would appear at the proposed council and submit himself to its decision.

<p>Henry then returned to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, but his severe lesson failed to effect any radical improvement in his conduct. Disgusted by his inconsistencies and dishonesty, the German princes on 15 March, 1077, elected Rudolph of Swabia to succeed him. Gregory wished to remain neutral, and even strove to effect a compromise between the opposing parties. Both, however, were dissatisfied, and prevented the proposed council from being held. Henry's conduct toward the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was meanwhile characterized by the greatest duplicity, and, when he went so far as to threaten to set up an <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, Gregory renewed in 1080 the sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against him. At Brixen in June, 1080, the king and his feudatory <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, supported by the Lombards, carried their threat into effect, and selected <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Gilbert</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under the title of <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Clement III</a>. Rudolph of Swabia having fallen mortally wounded at the battle of Mersburg in 1080. Henry could concentrate all his forces against Gregory. In 1081 he marched on <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but failed to force his way into the city, which he finally accomplished only in 1084. Gregory thereupon retired into the exile of Sant' Angelo, and refused to entertain Henry's overtures, although the latter promised to hand over <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert</a> as a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">sovereign pontiff</a> would only consent to crown him emperor. Gregory, however, insisted as a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> preliminary that Henry should appear before a council and do penance. The emperor, while pretending to submit to these terms, tried hard to prevent the meeting of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. A small number however assembled, and, in accordance with their wishes, Gregory again <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Henry. The latter on receipt of this news again entered <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 21 March, 1084. <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and then <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Henry emperor. However, <a href="../cathen/07072b.htm">Robert Guiscard</a>, Duke of Normandy, with whom Gregory had formed an alliance, was already marching on the city, and Henry, learning of his advance, fled towards Citta Castellana. The pontiff was liberated, but, the people becoming incensed by the excesses of his Norman allies, he was compelled to leave <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Disappointed and sorrowing he withdrew to <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, and later to the castle of <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a> by the sea, where he died in the following year. Three days before his death he withdrew all the censures of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> that he had pronounced, except those against the two chief offenders--Henry and <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibert</a>. His last words were: "I have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> iniquity, therefore I die in exile." His body was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in the church of Saint Matthew at <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> in 1584, and <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> in 1728 by <a href="../cathen/02431a.htm">Benedict XIII</a>. His writings treat mainly of the principles and practice of Church government. They may be found under the title "Gregorii VII registri sive epistolarum libri" in <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio" (Florence, 1759) and "S. Gregorii VII epistolae et diplomata" by Horoy (Paris, 1877).
