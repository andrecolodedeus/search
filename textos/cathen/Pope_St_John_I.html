<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope St. John I</h1>  

<p>Died at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> on 18 or 19 May (according to the most popular calculation), 526. A <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscan</a> by birth and the son of Constantius, he was, after an interregnum of seven days, <a href="../cathen/11456a.htm">elected</a> on 13 August, 523, and occupied the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic see</a> for two years, nine months, and seven days.

<p>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of the matter of his administration, for his <a href="../cathen/03048c.htm">Bullarium</a> contains only the two letters addressed to an Archbishop Zacharias and to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> respectively, and it is very certain that both are <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>.

<p>We possess information &#151; though unfortunately very vague &#151; only about his journey to Constantinople, a journey which appears to have had results of great importance, and which was the cause of his death. The Emperor Justin, in his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, had issued in 523 a severe <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, compelling them, among other things, to surrender to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> the churches which they occupied. <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>, King of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a> and of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the ardent defender of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, keenly resented these measures directed against his coreligionists in the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Orient</a>, and was moreover highly displeased at seeing the progress of a mutual understanding between the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin</a> and <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Churches</a>, such as might favour certain secret dealings between the Roman senators and the Byzantine Court, aiming at the re-establishment of the imperial authority in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. To bring pressure to bear upon the emperor, and force him to moderate his policy of repression in regard to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> sent to him early in 525 an embassy composed of Roman senators, of which he <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to assume the direction, and imposed on the latter the task of securing a withdrawal of the Edict of 523 and &#151; if we are to believe "Anonymous Valesianus" &#151; of even urging the emperor to facilitate the return to <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> who had been <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a>.

<p>There has been much discussion as to the part played by John I in this affair. The sources which enable us to study the subject are far from explicit and may be reduced to four in number: "Anonymous Valesianus", already cited; the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>; <a href="../cathen/07018b.htm">Gregory of Tours's</a> "Liber in gloria martyrum"; and the "Liber Pontificalis Ecclesi&aelig; Ravennatis". But it is beyond question that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> could only counsel Justin to use gentleness and discretion towards the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>; his position as head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> prevented his inviting the emperor to favour <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. That this analysis of the situation is correct is evident from the reception which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was accorded in the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">East</a> &#151; a reception which certainly would not have been kindly, had the Roman ambassadors opposed the emperor and this <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> subjects in their struggle waged against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian sect</a>. The inhabitants of Constantinople went out in throngs to meet John. The Emperor Justin on meeting him prostrated himself, and, some time afterwards, he had himself <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. All the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">East</a> made haste to manifest their communion in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">supreme pontiff</a>; only Timothy of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, who had shown himself hostile to the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, held aloof. Finally, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, exercising his right of precedence over <a href="../cathen/05504b.htm">Epiphanius</a>, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, solemnly officiated at St. Sophia in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Rite</a> on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Day</a>, 19 April, 526. Immediately afterwards he made his way back to the West.

<p>If this brilliant reception of John I by the emperor, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Orient</a> proves that he had not been wanting in his task as supreme <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the strongly contrasting behaviour of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> towards him on his return is no less evident <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. This monarch, enraged at seeing the national party reviving in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, had just stained his hands with the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of <a href="../cathen/02610b.htm">Boethius</a>, the great <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and of Symmachus his father-in-law. He was exasperated against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, whose embassy had obtained a success very different from that which he, <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>, desired and whom, moreover, he suspected of favouring the defenders of the ancient liberty of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. As soon as John, returning from the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">East</a>, had landed in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be arrested and incarcerated at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. Worn out by the fatigues of the journey, and subjected to severe privations, John soon died in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.

<p>His body was transported to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Basilica of St. Peter</a>. In his epitaph there is no allusion to his historical role. The <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> has placed him among its <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and commemorates him on 27 May, the ninth <a href="../cathen/09193a.htm">lesson</a> in the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Roman Breviary</a> for that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to him.
