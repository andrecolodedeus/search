<h1>Pope St. Julius I</h1>  

<p>(337-352).

<p>The immediate successor of Pope Silvester, Arcus, ruled the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> for only a very short period &mdash; from 18 January to 7 October, 336 &mdash; and after his death the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chair remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> for four months. What occasioned this comparatively long vacancy is unknown. On 6 Feb., 337, Julius, son of Rustics and a native of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. His pontificate is chiefly celebrated for his judicious and firm intervention in the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> controversies, about which we have abundant sources of information. After the death of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> (22 May, 337), his son Constantine II, Governor of Gaul, permitted the exiled <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> to return to his <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">See of Alexandria</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">ATHANASIUS</a>). The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, however, set up a rival <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of Pistus, and sent an embassy to Julius asking him to admit Pistus into communion with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and delivering to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the decisions of the Council of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> (335) to prove that <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> had been validly deposed. On his side <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> likewise sent envoys to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to deliver to Julius a synodal letter of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, containing a complete justification of their patriarch. On the arrival of the Athanasian envoys in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Macarius, the head of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> representatives, left the city; the two remaining <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> envoys, with the Athanasian deputies, were summoned by Pope Julius. The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> envoys now begged the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to assemble a great synod before which both parties should present their case for decision.

<p>Julius convened the synod at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, having dispatched two envoys to bear a letter of invitation to the Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Under the leadership of <a href="../cathen/05623b.htm">Eusebius</a>, who had been raised from <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> to the See of Constantinople, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had meanwhile held a council at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and elected George of Cappadocia <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> in the place of Pistus. George was intruded forcibly into his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, being again exiled, made his way to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Many other Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> removed by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> party, among them <a href="../cathen/09642a.htm">Marcellus of Ancyra</a>, also came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In a letter couched in haughty terms, however, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the party of <a href="../cathen/05623b.htm">Eusebius</a> refused to attend the synod summoned by Julius. The synod was held in the autumn of 340 or 341, under the presidency of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in the titular church of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Vitus. After a detailed examination of the documents, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> and <a href="../cathen/09642a.htm">Marcellus of Ancyra</a>, who had made a satisfactory profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, were exonerated and re-established in their episcopal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Pope Julius communicated this decision in a very notable and able letter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Eusebian party. In this letter he justifies his proceedings in the case, defends in detail his action in reinstating <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a>, and animadverts strongly on the non-appearance of the Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at the council, the convening of which they themselves had suggested. Even if <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">Athanasius</a> and his companions were somewhat to blame, the letter runs, the Alexandrian Church should first have written to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. "Can you be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>," writes the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, "that this is the custom, that we should be written to first, so that from here what is just may be defined" (Julii ep. ad Antiochenos, c. xxii). After his victory over his brother Constantine II, Emperor Constans was ruler over the greater part of the Empire. He was entirely <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> in his views, and, at the request of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and other Western <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, interceded with his brother Constantius, Emperor of the East, in favour of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had been deposed and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> party. Both rulers agreed that there should be convened a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> of the Western and Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a>, the principal city of the Province of Dacia Mediterranea (the modern Sofia). It took place in the autumn of 342 or 343, Julius sending as his representatives the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> Archidamus and Philoxenus and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Leo. Although the Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> party did not join in the council, but held their assembly separate and then departed, the synod nevertheless accomplished its task. Through the important canons iii, iv, and v (vii in the Latin text) of this council, the procedure against accused <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was more exactly regulated, and the manner of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> intervention in the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was definitely established.

<p>At the close of its transactions the synod communicated its decisions to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in a dutiful letter. Notwithstanding the reaffirmation of his innocence by the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Synod of Sardica</a>, <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> was not restored to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> by Emperor Constantius until after the death of George, the rival <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, in 346. Pope Julius took this occasion to write a letter, which is still extant, to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and the faithful of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, to congratulate them on the return of their great <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. The two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Ursacius of Singidunum and <a href="../cathen/15253b.htm">Valens</a> of Mursia, who, on account of their <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, had been deposed by the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a>, now made a formal recantation of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to Julius, who, having summoned them to an audience and received a signed confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, restored to them their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal sees</a>. Concerning the inner life of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> during the pontificate of Julius we have no exact information; all agree, however, that there was a rapid increase in the number of the faithful in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where Julius had two new <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> erected: the titular church of Julius (now S. Maria in Trastevere) and the Basilica Julia (now the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Twelve Apostles</a>). Beside these he built three churches over cemeteries outside the walls of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>: one on the road to Porto, a second on the Via Aurelia, and a third on the Via Flaminia at the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> <a href="../cathen/15254a.htm">St. Valentine</a>. The ruins of the last-mentioned have been discovered. The veneration of the faithful for the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> continued to spread rapidly. Under the pontificate of Julius, if not earlier, catalogues of feast-days of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> came into use &mdash; the Roman feast-calendar of Philocalus dates from the year 336.

<p>Through St. Athanasius, who remained in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> several years subsequent to 339, the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> monastic life became well-known in the capital, and the example of the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">deserts</a> found many imitators in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. Julius died on 12 April, 352, and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> of Calepodius on the Aurelian Way, and, very soon after his death, was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a saint. His body was later transported to S. Maria in Trastevere, the church which he had built. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 12 April.
