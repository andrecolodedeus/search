<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope St. Leo II</h1>  

<p>Pope (682-83), <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; d. 28 June, 683. He was a <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a>, and son of one Paul. Though elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a few days after the death of St. Agatho (10 January, 681), he was not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> till after the lapse of a year and seven months (17 Aug., 682). Under Leo's predecessor St. Agatho, negotiations had been opened between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> Pogonatus concerning the relations of the Byzantine Court to papal elections. Constantine had already promised Agatho to abolish or reduce the tax which for about a century the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had had to pay to the imperial treasury on the occasion of their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and under Leo's successor he made other changes in what had hitherto been required of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> at the time of a papal election. In all probability, therefore, it was continued correspondence on this matter which caused the delay of the imperial confirmation of Leo's election, and hence the long postponement of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. The most important act accomplished by Leo in his short pontificate was his confirmation of the acts of the Sixth Oecumenical Council (680-1). This council had been held in Constantinople against the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelites</a>, and had been presided over by the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> of Pope Agatho. After Leo had notified the emperor that the decrees of the council had been confirmed by him, he proceeded to make them known to the nations of the West. The letters which he sent for this end to the king and to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and nobles of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> have come down to us. In them he explained what the council had effected, and he called upon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to subscribe to its decrees. At the same time he was at pains to make it clear that in condemning his predecessor Honorius I, he did so, not because he taught <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, but because he was not active enough in opposing it. In accordance with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> mandate, a synod was held at Toledo (684) in which the Council of Constantinople was accepted.

<p>The fact that <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> had long been the residence of the emperors or of their representatives, the exarchs, had awakened the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of its <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>. They aspired to the privileges of <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> and desired to be autocephalous, i.e. free from the direct <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, considered as their <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a>. As they could not succeed in inducing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> to agree to their wishes, they attempted to secure their accomplishment by an imperial <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> recognizing them as autocephalous. But this did not prove sufficient to enable the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> to effect their purpose, and Leo obtained from Constantine Pogonatus the revocation of the edict of Constans. On his side, however, Leo abolished the tax which the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> had been accustomed to pay when they received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>. And though he insisted that the archbishops-elect must come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, he consented to the arrangement that they should not be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to remain in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> more than eight days at the time of their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, and that, while they were not to be bound to come again to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> themselves in order to offer their homage to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, they were each year to send a delegate to do so in their name. Perhaps because he feared that the Lombards might again ravage the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>, Leo transferred thence many of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> into a church which he built to receive them. This <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who is called by his contemporary biographer both just and learned, is commemorated as a saint in the Roman Martyrology on 28 June.

<p>[<em>Note:</em> The feast of Saint Leo II was formerly observed on 3 July with the rank of a semi-double.]
