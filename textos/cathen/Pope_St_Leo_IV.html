<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope St. Leo IV</h1>  

<p>(Reigned 847-55)

<p>A Roman and the son of Radoald, was unanimously elected to succeed <a href="../cathen/13728c.htm">Sergius II</a>, and as the alarming attack of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> on <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 846 caused the people to fear for the safety of the city, he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> (10 April, 847) without the consent of the emperor. Leo received his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Martin, near St. Peter's. His <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> behaviour attracted the notice of <a href="../cathen/06789b.htm">Gregory IV</a>, who made him a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>; and he was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-Priest</a> of the church of the Quatuor Coronati by <a href="../cathen/13728c.htm">Sergius II</a>. As soon as Leo, much against his will, became <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he began to take precautions against a repetition of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> raid of 846. He put the walls of the city into a thorough state of repair, entirely rebuilding fifteen of the great towers. He was the first to enclose the Vatican hill by a wall. To do this, he received money from the emperor, and help from all the cities and agricultural colonies (<em>domus cultae</em>) of the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The work took him four years to accomplish, and the newly fortified portion was called the Leonine City, after him. In 852 the fortifications were completed, and were blessed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with great solemnity.

<p>Whilst the work of refortifying the city was in progress, a great fleet of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> sailed for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, seemingly from <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, but it was completely destroyed off <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> by the allied fleets of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06333a.htm">Gaeta</a>, and by a tempest (849). When the rebuilding of the walls of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was accomplished, Leo rebuilt Portus, and handed it over to a number of <a href="../cathen/04396b.htm">Corsican</a> exiles, whom the ravages of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> had driven from their homes. Other cities too in the Roman duchy were fortified, either by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> himself or in consequence of his exhortations. Leo also endeavoured to make good the damage which the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracen</a> raid of 846 had done to the different churches. St. Peter's had suffered very severely, and though as a whole it never again reached its former magnificence, Leo managed to make it in parts at least more beautiful than it had been before. St. Martin's, where he had been <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, the Quatuor Coronati, of which he had been the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, the Lateran Palace, the Anglo-Saxon Borgo, <a href="../cathen/14321a.htm">Subiaco</a>, and many other places both in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and out of it were renovated by the energetic Leo. It was by this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> that the church of S. Maria Nova was built, to replace S. Maria Antiqua, which the decaying Palace of the Caesars threatened to engulf, and of which the ruins have recently been brought to light. In 850 Leo associated with Lothair in the empire his son Louis, by imposing on him the imperial crown. Three years later "he hallowed the child Alfred to king [says an old English historian] by anointing; and receiving him for his own child by adoption, gave him confirmation, and sent him back [to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>] with the blessing of St. Peter the Apostle."

<p>The same year (853) he held an important synod in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in which various decrees were passed for the furtherance of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> and learning, and for the condemnation of the refractory Anastasius, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of St. Marcellus, and sometime librarian of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. Equally rebellious conduct on the part of John, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, forced Leo to undertake a journey to that city to inspire John and his accomplices with respect for the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. It was while engaged in endeavouring to inspire another <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar of Reims</a>, with this same reverence, that Leo died. Another man who, till his death (851), defied the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was Nomenoe, Duke of Brittany. Anxious to be independent of the imperial authority Nomenoe, in defiance both of Leo and Charles the Bald, not only deposed a number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but made new ones, and subjected them to a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a> (Dol) of his own creation. It was not till the thirteenth century that the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a> recovered his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the Breton <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. For consecrating a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> outside his own diocese, St. Methodius, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, had suspended Gregory Asbestas, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14395b.htm">Syracuse</a>. St. Ignatius, who succeeded St. Methodius, in consequence forbade Gregory to be present at his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. This led Gregory to break all bounds. St. Ignatius accordingly <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> him to be deposed, and begged the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to confirm the deposition. This, however, Leo would not do, because, as he said, Ignatius had assembled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and deposed others without his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, whereas he ought not to have done so "in the absence of our <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> or of letters from us". Despite the fact that Leo was then in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, one of his dependents, Daniel, a <em>magister militum</em>, accused him to the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Emperor Louis of wishing to overthrow the domination of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> by a Greek alliance. Leo had, however, no difficulty in convincing Louis that the charge was absolutely groundless. Daniel was condemned to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death</a> and only escaped it by the intercession of the emperor. Shortly after this Leo died, and was buried in St. Peter's (17 July, 855). He is credited with being a worker of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> both by his biographer and by the Patriarch Photius. His name is found in the Roman Martyrology.
