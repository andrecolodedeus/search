<h1>Pope St. Leo I (the Great)</h1>  

<p>(Reigned 440-61).

<p>Place and <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; died 10 November, 461. Leo's pontificate, next to that of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory I</a>, is the most significant and important in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity. At a time when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was experiencing the greatest obstacles to her progress in consequence of the hastening disintegration of the Western Empire, while the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Orient</a> was profoundly agitated over dogmatic controversies, this great <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, with far-seeing sagacity and powerful hand, guided the destiny of the Roman and Universal Church. According to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (ed. Mommsen, I, 101 sqq., ed. Duchesne, I, 238 sqq.), Leo was a native of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> name was Quintianus. Our earliest certain historical information about Leo reveals him a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> under <a href="../cathen/03477c.htm">Pope Celestine I</a> (422-32). Even during this period he was known outside of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and had some relations with Gaul, since Cassianus in 430 or 431 wrote at Leo's suggestion his work "De Incarnatione Domini contra Nestorium" (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, P.L., L, 9 sqq.), prefacing it with a letter of dedication to Leo. About this time <a href="../cathen/04592b.htm">Cyril of Alexandria</a> appealed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> against the pretensions of Bishop Juvenal of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>. From an assertion of Leo's in a letter of later date (ep. cxvi, ed. <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Ballerini</a>, I, 1212; II, 1528), it is not very clear whether Cyril wrote to him in the capacity of Roman <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, or to Pope Celestine. During the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/14032a.htm">Sixtus III</a> (422-40), Leo was sent to Gaul by <a href="../cathen/15255b.htm">Emperor Valentinian III</a> to settle a dispute and bring about a reconciliation between <a href="../cathen/01177b.htm">A&#235;tius</a>, the chief military commander of the province, and the chief magistrate, Albinus. This commission is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the great confidence placed in the clever and able <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> by the Imperial Court. <a href="../cathen/14032a.htm">Sixtus III</a> died on 19 August, 440, while Leo was in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, and the latter was chosen his successor. Returning to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Leo was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 29 September of the same year, and governed the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> for the next twenty-one years.

<p>Leo's chief aim was to sustain the <a href="../cathen/15179a.htm">unity of the Church</a>. Not long after his elevation to the Chair of Peter, he saw himself compelled to combat energetically the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> which seriously threatened church unity even in the West. Leo had ascertained through Bishop Septimus of Altinum, that in Aquileia <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, who had been adherents of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a>, were admitted to communion without an explicit <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjuration</a> of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sharply censured this procedure, and directed that a provincial synod should be assembled in <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, at which such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were to be required to <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjure</a> <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> publicly and to subscribe to an unequivocal confession of Faith (epp. i and ii). This <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> waged <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> even more strenuously against <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a>, inasmuch as its adherents, who had been driven from <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>, had settled in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and had succeeded in establishing a secret <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> community there. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ordered the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to point out these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and in 443, together with the senators and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, conducted in person an investigation, in the course of which the leaders of the community were examined. In several sermons he emphatically warned the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to be on their guard against this reprehensible <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and repeatedly charged them to give information about its followers, their dwellings, acquaintances, and rendezvous (Sermo ix, 4, xvi, 4; xxiv, 4; xxxiv, 4 sq.; xlii, 4 sq.; lxxvi, 6). A number of <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were converted and admitted to confession; others, who remained obdurate, were in obedience to imperial decrees banished from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by the civil magistrates. On 30 January, 444, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sent a letter to all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, to which he appended the documents containing his proceedings against the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and warned them to be on their guard and to take action against the followers of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> (ep. vii). On 19 June, 445, <a href="../cathen/15255b.htm">Emperor Valentinian III</a> issued, doubtless at the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> instigation, a stern edict in which he established seven punishments for the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> ("Epist. Leonis", ed. <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Ballerini</a>, I, 626; ep. viii inter Leon. ep). Prosper of Aquitaine states in his "Chronicle" (ad an. 447; "Mon. Germ. hist. Auct. antiquissimi", IX, I, 341 sqq.) that, in consequence of Leo's energetic measures, the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> were also driven out of the provinces, and even Oriental <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> emulated the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> example in regard to this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Priscillianism still survived, and for some time had been attracting fresh adherents. Bishop Turibius of <a href="../cathen/02018d.htm">Astorga</a> became cognizant of this, and by extensive journeys collected minute information about the condition of the churches and the spread of Priscillianism. He compiled the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, wrote a refutation of the same, and sent these documents to several African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. He also sent a copy to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, whereupon the latter sent a lengthy letter to Turibius (ep. xv) in refutation of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the Priscillianists. Leo at the same time ordered that a council of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> belonging to the neighbouring provinces should be convened to institute a rigid enquiry, with the object of determining whether any of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had become tainted with the poison of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Should any such be discovered, they were to be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> without hesitation. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> also addressed a similar letter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Spanish provinces, notifying them that a universal synod of all the chief <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> was to be summoned; if this should be found to be impossible, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Galicia at least should be assembled. These two <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were in fact held in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to deal with the points at issue (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, "Konziliengesch." II, 2nd ed., pp. 306 sqq.).



<p>The greatly disorganized <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> condition of certain countries, resulting from national migrations, demanded closer bonds between their episcopate and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for the better promotion of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> life. Leo, with this object in view, determined to make use of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> vicariate of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Arles for the province of Gaul for the creation of a centre for the Gallican episcopate in immediate union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In the beginning his efforts were greatly hampered by his conflict with <a href="../cathen/07349a.htm">St. Hilary</a>, then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles. Even earlier, conflicts had arisen relative to the vicariate of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Arles and its privileges. Hilary made excessive use of his authority over other ecclesiastical provinces, and claimed that all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by him, instead of by their own <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>. When, for example, the complaint was raised that Bishop Celidonius of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&#231;on</a> had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in violation of the canons&mdash;the grounds alleged being that he had, as a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, married a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, and, as a public officer, had given his consent to a death sentence&mdash;Hilary deposed him, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Importunus as his successor. Celidonius thereupon appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and set out in person for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. About the same time Hilary, as if the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> concerned had been vacant, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to take the place of a certain Bishop Projectus, who was ill. Projectus recovered, however, and he too laid a complaint at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> about the action of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles. Hilary then went himself to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to justify his proceedings. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> assembled a Roman synod (about 445) and, when the complaints brought against Celidonius could not be verified, reinstated the latter in his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>. Projectus also received his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> again. Hilary returned to Arles before the synod was over; the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> deprived him of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the other Gallic provinces and of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> over the province of Vienne, only allowing him to retain his Diocese of Arles.

<p>These decisions were disclosed by Leo in a letter to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Province of Vienne (ep. x). At the same time he sent them an edict of <a href="../cathen/15255b.htm">Valentinian III</a> of 8 July, 445, in which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> measures in regard to St. Hilary were supported, and the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a> over the whole Church solemnly recognized "Epist. Leonis," ed. <a href="../cathen/02223b.htm">Ballerini</a>, I, 642). On his return to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> Hilary sought a reconciliation with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. After this there arose no further difficulties between these two saintly men and, after his death in 449, Hilary was declared by Leo as "beat&aelig; memori&aelig;". To Bishop Ravennius, St. Hilary's successor in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> of Arles, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of that province, Leo addressed most cordial letters in 449 on the election of the new <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> (epp. xl, xli). When Ravennius <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> a little later a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to take the place of the deceased <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/16078b.htm">Vaison</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Vienne, who was then in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, took exception to this action. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province of Arles then wrote a joint letter to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, in which they begged him to restore to Ravennius the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of which his predecessor Hilary had been deprived (ep. lxv inter ep. Leonis). In his reply <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 5 May, 450 (ep. lxvi), Leo acceded to their request. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Vienne was to retain only the suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a>, <a href="../cathen/14454a.htm">Tarentaise</a>, <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>, and Grenoble; all the other sees in the Province of Vienne were made subject to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Arles, who also became again the mediator between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the whole Gallic episcopate. Leo transmitted to Ravennius (ep. lxvii), for communication to the other Gallican <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, his celebrated letter to <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian of Constantinople</a> on the Incarnation. Ravennius thereupon convened a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a>, at which forty-four chief <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> assembled. In their synodal letter of 451, they affirm that they accept the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> letter as a symbol of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (ep. xxix inter ep. Leonis). In his answer Leo speaks further of the condemnation of Nestorius (ep. cii). The Vicariate of Arles for a long time retained the position Leo had accorded it. Another <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> vicariate was that of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> extended over <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a>. The special <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of this vicariate was to protect the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> over the district of Eastern <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a>, which belonged to the Eastern Empire. Leo bestowed the vicariate upon Bishop Anastasius of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a>, just as <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">Pope Siricius</a> had formerly entrusted it to Bishop Anysius. The vicar was to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>, to assemble in a synod all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Province of Eastern <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a>, to oversee their administration of their office; but the most important matters were to be submitted to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (epp. v, vi, xiii). But Anastasius of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a> used his authority in an arbitrary and despotic manner, so much so that he was severely reproved by Leo, who sent him fuller directions for the exercise of his office (ep. xiv).

<p>In Leo's conception of his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as supreme <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>, the maintenance of strict <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> occupied a prominent place. This was particularly important at a time when the continual ravages of the barbarians were introducing disorder into all conditions of life, and the rules of morality were being seriously violated. Leo used his utmost energy in maintining this discipline, insisted on the exact observance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>, and did not hesitate to rebuke when <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Letters (ep. xvii) relative to these and other matters were sent to the different <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Western Empire&mdash;e.g., to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Italian provinces (epp. iv, xix, clxvi, clxviii), and to those of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, who had tolerated deviations from the Roman Liturgy in the administration of Baptism (ep. xvi), and concerning other matters (ep. xvii). A very important disciplinary <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was sent to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/13275a.htm">Rusticus of Narbonne</a> (ep. clxvii). Owing to the dominion of the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> in Latin North Africa, the position of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there had become extremely gloomy. Leo sent the Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Potentius thither to inform himself about the exact condition, and to forward a report to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On receiving this Leo sent a letter of detailed instructions to the episcopate of the province about the adjustment of numerous <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> and disciplinary questions (ep. xii). Leo also sent a letter to <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscurus of Alexandria</a> on 21 July, 445, urging him to the strict observance of the canons and discipline of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> (ep. ix). The primacy of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> was thus manifested under this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the most various and distinct ways. But it was especially in his interposition in the confusion of the <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a> quarrels, which then so profoundly agitated <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Christendom</a>, that Leo most brilliantly revealed himself the wise, learned, and energetic shepherd of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (see <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">M<font size=-2>ONOPHYSITISM</font></a>). From his first letter on this subject, written to <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a> on 1 June, 448 (ep. xx), to his last letter written to the new <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, Timotheus Salophaciolus, on 18 August, 460 (ep. clxxi), we cannot but admire the clear, positive, and systematic manner in which Leo, fortified by the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, took part in this difficult entanglement. For particulars refer to the articles: <a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">E<font size=-2>UTYCHES</font> </a>; <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">S<font size=-2>AINT</font> F<font size=-2>LAVIAN</font></a>; <a href="../cathen/05495a.htm">R<font size=-2>OBBER</font> C<font size=-2>OUNCIL OF</font> E<font size=-2>PHESUS</font></a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/05631a.htm">Eutyches</a> appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> after he had been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a>, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, on account of his <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> views. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, after investigating the disputed question, sent his sublime dogmatic letter to <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a> (ep. xxviii), concisely setting forth and confirming the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Incarnation, and the union of the Divine and human natures in the one Person of Christ . In 449 the council, which was designated by Leo as the "Robber Synod", was held. <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a> and other powerful <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> of the East appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The latter sent urgent letters to Constantinople, particularly to Emperor Theodosius II and Empress Pulcheria, urging them to convene a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> in order to restore peace to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. To the same end he used his influence with the Western emperor, <a href="../cathen/15255b.htm">Valentinian III</a>, and his mother Galla Placidia, especially during their visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 450. This general council was held in Chalcedon in 451 under Marcian, the successor of Theodosius. It solemnly accepted Leo's dogmatical epistle to <a href="../cathen/06098c.htm">Flavian</a> as an expression of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> concerning the Person of Christ. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> confirmed the decrees of the Council after eliminating the canon, which elevated the Patriarchate of Constantinople, while diminishing the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the ancient Oriental <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>. On 21 March, 453, Leo issued a circular letter confirming his <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">dogmatic definition</a> (ep. cxiv). Through the mediation of Bishop Julian of Cos, who was at that time the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> ambassador in Constantinople, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> tried to protect further <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> interests in the Orient. He persuaded the new Emperor of Constantinople, Leo I, to remove the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> and irregular patriarch, Timotheus Ailurus, from the <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">See of Alexandria</a>. A new and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> patriarch, Timotheus Salophaciolus, was chosen to fill his place, and received the congratulations of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the last letter which Leo ever sent to the Orient.

<p>In his far-reaching pastoral care of the Universal Church, in the West and in the East, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> never neglected the domestic interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. When Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> had been devastated by <a href="../cathen/02061b.htm">Attila</a>, Leo by a personal encounter with the King of the Huns prevented him from marching upon <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At the emperor's wish, Leo, accompanied by the Consul Avienus and the Prefect Trigetius, went in 452 to Upper <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and met <a href="../cathen/02061b.htm">Attila</a> at Mincio in the vicinity of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, obtaining from him the promise that he would withdraw from <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and negotiate peace with the emperor. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> also succeeded in obtaining another great favour for the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. When in 455 the city was captured by the <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a> under Genseric, although for a fortnight the town had been plundered, Leo's intercession obtained a promise that the city should not be injured and that the lives of the inhabitants should be spared. These incidents show the high moral authority enjoyed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, manifested even in temporal affairs. Leo was always on terms of intimacy with the Western Imperial Court. In 450 <a href="../cathen/15255b.htm">Emperor Valentinian III</a> visited <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, accompanied by his wife Eudoxia and his mother Galla Placidia. On the feast of Cathedra Petri (22 February), the Imperial <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> with their brilliant retinue took part in the solemn services at St. Peter's, upon which occasion the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> delivered an impressive sermon. Leo was also active in building and restoring churches. He built a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> over the grave of <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Pope Cornelius</a> in the Via Appia. The roof of <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul's without the Walls</a> having been destroyed by lightning, he had it replaced, and undertook other improvements in the basilica. He persuaded Empress Galla Placidia, as seen from the inscription, to have executed the great <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> of the Arch of Triumph, which has survived to our day. Leo also restored St. Peter's on the Vatican. During his pontificate a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Roman lady, named Demetria, erected on her <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> on the Via Appia a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of St. Stephen, the ruins of which have been excavated.

<p>Leo was no less active in the spiritual elevation of the <a href="../cathen/13136a.htm">Roman congregations</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/07448a.htm">sermons</a>, of which ninety-six genuine examples have been preserved, are remarkable for their profundity, clearness of diction, and elevated style. The first five of these, which were delivered on the anniversaries of his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, manifest his lofty conception of the dignity of his office, as well as his thorough conviction of the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>, shown forth in so outspoken and decisive a manner by his whole activity as supreme <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. Of his letters, which are of great importance for <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, 143 have come down to us: we also possess thirty which were sent to him. The so-called "Sacramentarium Leonianum" is a collection of orations and prefaces of the Mass, prepared in the second half of the sixth century. Leo died on 10 November, 461, and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibule</a> of St. Peter's on the Vatican. In 688 <a href="../cathen/13728b.htm">Pope Sergius</a> had his remains transferred to the basilica itself, and a special altar erected over them. They rest today in St. Peter's, beneath the altar specially dedicated to St. Leo. In 1754 <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> exalted him to the dignity of <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Church</a> (<em>doctor ecclesi&aelig;</em>). In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast day</a> of the great <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is held on 11 April, and in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> on 18 February.
