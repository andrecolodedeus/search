<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope St. Linus</h1>  

<p>(Reigned about A.D. 64 or 67 <em>to</em> 76 or 79).

<p>All the ancient records of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman bishops</a> which have been handed down to us by <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">St. Irenaeus</a>, <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Julius Africanus</a>, <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">St. Hippolytus</a>, <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, also the Liberian catalogue of 354, place the name of Linus directly after that of the Prince of the Apostles, <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a>. These records are traced back to a list of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman bishops</a> which existed in the time of <a href="../cathen/05378a.htm">Pope Eleutherus</a> (about 174-189), when <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> wrote his book "Adversus haereses". As opposed to this testimony, we cannot accept as more reliable <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian's</a> assertion, which unquestionably places <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">St. Clement</a> (De praescriptione, xxii) after the <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Apostle Peter</a>, as was also done later by other Latin scholars (Jerome, <a href="../fathers/2708.htm"><em>Illustrious Men</em> 15</a>). The Roman list in <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> has undoubtedly greater claims to historical authority. This author claims that Pope Linus is the Linus mentioned by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> in his <a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs21">2 Timothy 4:21</a>. The passage by <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103303.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> III.3.3</a>) reads:

<blockquote><p>After the Holy Apostles (<a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>) had founded and set the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in order (in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>) they gave over the exercise of the episcopal office to Linus. The same Linus is mentioned by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> in his Epistle to Timothy. His successor was Anacletus.</p></blockquote>

<p>We cannot be positive whether this identification of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as being the Linus mentioned in <a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs21">2 Timothy 4:21</a> goes back to an ancient and reliable source, or originated later on account of the similarity of the name.

<p>Linus's term of office, according to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> lists handed down to us, lasted only twelve years. The Liberian Catalogue shows that it lasted twelve years, four months, and twelve days. The dates given in this catalogue, A.D. 56 until A.D. 67, are incorrect. Perhaps it was on account of these dates that the writers of the fourth century gave their opinion that Linus had held the position of head of the Roman community during the life of the Apostle; e.g., <a href="../cathen/13221b.htm">Rufinus</a> in the preface to his translation of the pseudo-Clementine "Recognitiones". But this hypothesis has no historical foundation. It cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that according to the accounts of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> in the second century, Linus was chosen to be head of the community of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, after the death of the Apostle. For this reason his pontificate dates from the year of the death of the Apostles <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, which, however, is not known for <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> asserts that Linus's home was in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, and that his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> name was Herculanus; but we cannot discover the origin of this assertion. According to the same work on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, Linus is supposed to have issued a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "in conformity with the ordinance of St. Peter", that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> should have their heads covered in church. Without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> is <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a>, and copied by the author of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> from the <a href="../bible/1co011.htm#vrs5">first Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians (11:5)</a> and arbitrarily attributed to the first successor of the Apostle in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The statement made in the same source, that Linus suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> and is improbable. For between <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a> and <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> there is no mention of any <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>; and <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (1. c., III, iv, 3) from among the early Roman <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> designates only <a href="../cathen/14477b.htm">Telesphorus</a> as a glorious <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>.

<p>Finally this book asserts that Linus after his death, was buried in the Vatican beside <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a>. We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether the author had any decisive reason for this assertion. As <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a> was certainly buried at the foot of the Vatican Hill, it is quite possible that the earliest <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> also were <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> there. There was nothing in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> tradition of the fourth-century <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> to prove this, because it was only at the end of the second century that any special feast of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> was instituted and consequently Linus does not appear in the fourth-century lists of the feasts of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. According to Torrigio ("Le sacre grotte Vaticane", <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, 1618, 53) when the present <a href="../cathen/04214a.htm">confession</a> was constructed in St. Peter's (1615), sarcophagi were found, and among them was one which bore the word Linus. The explanation given by Severano of this discovery ("Memorie delle sette chiese di Roma", Rome, 1630, 120) is that probably these sarcophagi contained the remains of the first Roman <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and that the one bearing that inscription was Linus's burial place. This assertion was repeated later on by different writers. But from a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of Torrigio's we see that on the sarcophagus in question there were other letters beside the word Linus, so that they rather belonged to some other name (such as Aquilinus, Anullinus). The place of the discovery of the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that it could not be the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Linus (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Inscriptiones christianae urbis Romae", II, 23-7).

<p>The feast of St. Linus is now celebrated on 23 September. This is also the date given in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>. An epistle on the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the Apostles <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was at a later period attributed to St. Linus, and supposedly was sent by him to the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Churches</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> and of later date than the history of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of the two Apostles, by some attributed to Marcellus, which is also <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> ("Acta Apostolorum apocrypha", ed. Lipsius and Bonnet, I, ed; Leipzig, 1891, XIV sqq., 1 sqq.).
