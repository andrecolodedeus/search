<h1>Pope St. Lucius I</h1>  

<p>Reigned 253-254; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 5 March, 254. After the death of <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">St. Cornelius</a>, who died in exile in the summer of 253, Lucius was chosen to fill his place, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>. Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of the early life of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> before his elevation. According to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, he was Roman born, and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> name was Porphyrius. Where the author obtained this information is not known. The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> under the Emperor Gallus, during which <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> had been banished, still went on. Lucius also was sent into exile soon after his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, but in a short time, presumably when <a href="../cathen/15256b.htm">Valerian</a> was made emperor, he was allowed to return to his flock. The Felician Catalogue, whose information is found in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, informs us of the banishment and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> return of Lucius: "Hic exul fuit et postea nutu Dei incolumis ad ecclesiam reversus est." <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, who wrote a (lost) letter of congratulation to Lucius on his elevation to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> and on his banishment, sent a second letter of congratulation to him and his companions in exile, as well as to the whole <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> (ep. lxi, ed. Hartel, II, 695 sqq.).

<p>The letter begins:

<blockquote><p>Beloved Brother, only a short time ago we offered you our congratulations, when in exalting you to govern His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> graciously bestowed upon you the twofold glory of confessor and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Again we congratulate you, your companions, and the whole congregation, in that, owing to the kind and mighty protection of our Lord, He has led you back with praise and glory to His own, so that the flock can again receive its shepherd, the ship her pilot, and the people a director to govern them and to show openly that it was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> disposition that He permitted your banishment, not that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who had been expelled should be deprived of his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but rather that he might return to his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with greater authority. </p></blockquote>

<p><a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> continues, alluding to the three Hebrew children in the fiery furnace, that the return from exile did not lessen the glory of the confession, and that the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, which was directed only against the confessors of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> which was the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. In conclusion he describes the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on the return of its shepherd. When <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> asserts that the Lord by means of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> sought "to bring the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to shame and to silence them," and thus to prove where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was, who was her one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> chosen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>, who were her <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> bound up with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the glory of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, who were the real people of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, united to His flock by a peculiar <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, who were those who were oppressed by their enemies, and at the same time who those were whom the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> protects as his own, he obviously means the <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatians</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, through which he was brought forward as <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, in opposition to <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a>, still continued in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> under Lucius.

<p>In the matter of confession and the restoration of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">"Lapsi"</a> (fallen) Lucius adhered to the principles of <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>. According to the testimony of the latter, contained in a letter to <a href="../cathen/14288a.htm">Pope Stephen</a> (ep. lxviii, 5, ed. Hartel, II, 748), Lucius, like <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a>, had expressed his opinions in writing: "Illi enim pleni spiritu Domini et in glorioso martyrio constituti dandam esse lapsis pacem censuerunt et poenitentia acta fructum communicationis et pacis negandum non esse litteris suis signaverunt." (For they, filled with the spirit of the Lord and confirmed in glorious <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, judged that pardon ought to be given to the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">Lapsi</a>, and signified in their letters that, when these had done penance, they were not to be denied the enjoyment of communion and reconciliation.) Lucius died in the beginning of March, 254. In the "Depositio episcoporum" the "Chronograph of 354" gives the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death as 5 March, the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum" as 4 March. The first date is probably right. Perhaps Lucius died on 4 March and was buried 5 March. According to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was beheaded in the time of <a href="../cathen/15256b.htm">Valerian</a>, but this testimony cannot be admitted. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a> in the letter to <a href="../cathen/14288a.htm">Stephen</a> above mentioned (ep. lxviii, 5) gives him, as well as <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a>, the honorary title of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>: "servandus est enim antecessorum nostrorum beatorum martyrum Cornelii et Lucii honor gloriosus" (for the glorious memory of our predecessors the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> and Lucius is to be preserved); but probably this was on account of Lucius's short banishment. <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a>, who died in exile, was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> by the Romans after his death; but not Lucius. In the Roman calendar of feasts of the "Chronograph of 354" he is mentioned in the "Depositio episcoporum", and not under the head of "Depositio martyrum". His memory was, nevertheless, particularly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a>, as is clear from the appearance of his name in the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum". <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, maintains (<a href="../fathers/250107.htm"><em>Church History</em> VII.10</a>) that <a href="../cathen/15256b.htm">Valerian</a> was favourable to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the early part of his reign. The emperor's first <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> edict appeared only in 257.

<p>Lucius was buried in a compartment of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> vault in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> of St. Callistus. On the excavation of the vault, de Rossi found a large fragment of the original epitaph, which only gives the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> name in Greek: LOUKIS. The slab is broken off just behind the word, so that in all probability there was nothing else on it except the title EPISKOPOS (<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>). The <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> were transferred by <a href="../cathen/11577a.htm">Pope Paul I</a> (757-767) to the church of San Silvestro in Capite, or by <a href="../cathen/11514a.htm">Pope Paschal I</a> (817-824) to the Basilica of St. Praxedes [Marucchi, "Basiliques et eglisesde Rome", Rome, 1902, 399 (inscription in San Silvestro), 325 (inscription in S. Praxedes)]. The author of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> has unauthorizedly ascribed to St. Lucius a <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretal</a>, according to which two <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and three <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> must always accompany the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to bear witness to his virtuous life: "Hic praecepit, ut duo presbyteri et tres diaconi in omni loco episcopum non desererent propter testimonium ecclesiasticum." Such a measure might have been <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> under certain conditions at a later period; but in Lucius's time it was incredible. This alleged <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> induced a later <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forger</a> to invent another <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretal</a>, and attribute it to Lucius. The story in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> that Lucius, as he was being led to death, gave the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> Stephen power over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is also a fabrication. The feast of St. Lucius is held on 4 March.
