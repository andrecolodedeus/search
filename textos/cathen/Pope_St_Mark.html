<h1>Pope St. Mark</h1>  

<p>Date of birth unknown; <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 18 Jan., 336; d. 7 Oct., 336. After the death of Pope Sylvester, Mark was raised to the Roman episcopal chair as his successor. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> says that he was a Roman, and that his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> name was Priscus. <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great's</a> letter, which summoned a conference of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for the investigation of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> dispute, is directed to <a href="../cathen/10318a.htm">Pope Miltiades</a> and one Mark (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250110.htm"><em>Church History</em> X.5</a>). This Mark was evidently a member of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, either <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or first <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and is perhaps identical with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The date of Mark's election (18 Jan., 336) is given in the Liberian Catalogue of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> (Duchesne, <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, I, 9), and is historically certain; so is the day of his death (7 Oct.), which is specified in the same way in the "Depositio episcoporum" of Philocalus's "Chronography", the first edition of which appeared also in 336. Concerning an interposition of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> troubles, which were then so actively affecting the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the East, nothing has been handed down. An alleged letter of his to <a href="../cathen/02035a.htm">St. Athanasius</a> is a later <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>. Two constitutions are attributed to Mark by the author of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (ed. Duchesne, I, 20). According to the one, he invested the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> with the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> that this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that, towards the end of the fourth century, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> did bestow the episcopal <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> upon the newly-elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; Augustine expressly bears witness to this (Breviarium Collationis, III, 16). It is indeed possible that Mark had confirmed this privilege by a constitution, which does not preclude the fact that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11346a.htm">Ostia</a> before this time usually <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. As for the bestowal of the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, the account cannot be established from sources of the fourth century, since the oldest memorials which show this badge, belong to the fifth and sixth centuries, and the oldest written mention of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> bestowing the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> dates from the sixth century (cf. Grisar, "Das r&ouml;mische Pallium und die altesten liturgischen Sch&auml;rpen", in "Festschrift des deutschen Campo Santo in Rom", Freiburg im Br., 1897, 83-114).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> remarks further of Marcus: "Et constitutum de omni ecclesia ordinavit"; but we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> which constitution this refers to. The building of two <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> is attributed to this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by the author of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>. One of these was built within the city in the region "juxta Pallacinis"; it is the present church of San Marco, which however received its present external shape by later alterations. It is mentioned in the fifth century as a Roman title church, so that its foundation may without difficulty be attributed to St. Mark. The other was outside the city; it was a cemetery church, which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> got built over the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Balbina, between the Via Appia and the Via Ardeatina (cf. de Rossi, "Roma sotterranea", III, 8-13; "Bullettino di arch. crist.", 1867, 1 sqq.; Wilpert, "Topographische Studien uber die christlichen Monumente der Appia und der Ardeatina", in "Rom. Quartalschrift", 1901, 32-49). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> obtained from <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> gifts of land and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> furniture for both <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>. Mark was buried in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Balbina, where he had built the cemetery church. His grave is expressly mentioned there by the itineraries of the seventh century (de Rossi, "Roma sotterranea", I, 180-1). The <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> of the deceased <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was given on 7 Oct. in the old Roman calendar of feasts, which was inserted in the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum"; it is still kept on the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. In an ancient <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> a laudatory poem is preserved (unfortunately in a mutilated text), which Pope Damasus had composed on a Saint Marcus (de Rossi, "Inscriptiones christ. urbis Romae.", II, 108; Ihm, "Damasi epigrammata", Leipzig, 1895, 17, no. 11). <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> refers this to Pope Mark, but Duchesne (loc. cit., 204), is unable to accept this view. Since the contents of the poem are of an entirely general nature, without any particularly characteristic feature from the life of Pope Mark, the question is not of great importance.
