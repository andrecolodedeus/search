<h1>Pope St. Martin I</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">Martyr</a>, born at <a href="../cathen/14754a.htm">Todi</a> on the Tiber, son of <a href="../cathen/05745a.htm">Fabricius</a>; <a href="../cathen/12270a.htm">elected</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Pope</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 21 July, 649, to succeed Theodore I; died at Cherson in the present peninsulas of Krym, 16 Sept., 655, after a reign of 6 years, one month and twenty six days, having <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> eleven <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, five <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and thirty-three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. 5 July is the date commonly given for his <a href="../cathen/12270a.htm">election</a>, but 21 July (given by Lobkowitz, "Statistik der Papste" Freiburg, 1905) seems to correspond better with the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of his death and reign (Duchesne "Lib. Pont.", I, 336); his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is on 12 November.The Greeks honor him on 13 April and 15 September, the <a href="../cathen/13253a.htm">Muscovites</a> on 14 April. In the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of the Office the Greeks style him <em>infallibilis fidei magister</em> because he was the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">successor of St. Peter</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">See of Rome</a> (<a href="../cathen/11078a.htm">Nilles</a>, "Calendarium Manuale", Innsbruck, 1896, I, 336).

<p>Martin, one of the noblest figures in a long line of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiffs</a> (Hodgkin, "Italy", VI, 268) was, according to his biographer Theodore (Mai, "Spicil. Rom.", IV 293) of noble birth, a great student, of commanding intelligence, of profound learning, and of great charity to the poor. Piazza, II 45 7 states that he belonged to the <a href="../cathen/02322a.htm">order of St. Basil</a>. He governed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at a time when the leaders of the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite heresy</a>, supported by the emperor, were making most strenuous efforts to spread their tenets in the East and West. <a href="../cathen/14570a.htm">Pope Theodore</a> had sent Martin as <a href="../cathen/01600a.htm">apocrysiary</a> to <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Constantinople</a> to make arrangements for <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">canonical deposition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> patriarch, Pyrrhus. After his <a href="../cathen/12270a.htm">election</a>, Martin had himself <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> without waiting for the imperial confirmation, and soon called a council in the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran</a> at which one hundred and five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> met. Five sessions were held on 5, 8, 17, 119 and 31 Oct., 649 (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, "Conciliengeschichte", III, 190). The "Ecthesis" of Heraclius and the "Typus" of Constans II were rejected; nominal <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> was passed against Sergius, Pyrrus, and Paul of Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/04597c.htm">Cyrus of Alexandria</a> and Theodore of Phran in Arabia; twenty canons were enacted defining the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> on the two wills of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The decrees signed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the assembled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were sent to the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and the faithful of the world together with an <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">encyclical</a> of Martin. The Acts with a Greek translation were also sent to the Emperor Constans II.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appointed John, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Philadelphia, as his vicar in the East with <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> instructions and full authority . Bishop Paul of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a> refused to recall his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> letters previously sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and added others,&mdash;he was, therefore, formally <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Constantinople</a>, Paul, had urged the emperor to use drastic means to force the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the Western Bishops at least to subscribe to the "Typus". The emperor sent Olympius as <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where he arrived while the council was still in session. Olympius tried to create a faction among the fathers to favor the views of the emperor, but without success. Then upon pretense of reconciliation he wished to receive <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> from the hands of the pontiff with the intention of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">slaying</a> him. But <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> protected the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and Olympius left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to fight against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> and died there. Constans II thwarted in his plans, sent as <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> Theodore Calliopas with orders to bring Martin to <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Constantinople</a>. Calliopas arrived in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 15 June, 653, and, entering the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a> two days later, informed the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> that Martin had been <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> as an unworthy intruder, that he must be brought to <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Constantinople</a> and that another was to be chosen in his place. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, wishing to avoid the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">shedding of human blood</a>, forbade resistance and declared himself willing to be brought before the emperor. The saintly <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a>, accompanied by only a few attendants, and suffering much from bodily ailments and privations, arrived at <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Constantinople</a> on 17 Sept., 653 or 654, having landed nowhere except the island of Naxos. The letters of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> seem to indicate he was kept at Naxos for a year. Jaffe, n. 1608, and Ewald, n 2079, consider the <em>annum fecimus</em> an interpolation and would allow only a very short stop at Naxos, which granted the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> an opportunity to enjoy a bath. Duchesne, "Lib. Pont.", I, 336 can see no reason for abandoning the original account; Hefele,"Conciliengeschichte" III, 212, held the same view (see "Zeitschr. f&uuml;r Kath. Theol.", 1892, XVI, 375).

<p>From Abydos messengers were sent to the imperial city to announce the arrival of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoner</a> who was branded as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> and rebel, an enemy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the State. Upon his arrival in <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Constantinople</a> Martin was left for several hours on deck exposed to the jests and insults of a curious crowd of spectators. Towards evening he was brought to a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> called Prandearia and kept in close and cruel confinement for ninety-three days, suffering from hunger, cold and thirst. All this did not break his energy and on 19 December he was brought before the assembled senate where the imperial treasurer acted as judge. Various political charges were made, but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and only charge was the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> refusal to sign the "Typus". He was then carried to an open space in full view of the emperor and of a large crowd of people. These were asked to pass <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to which but few responded. Numberless indignities were heaped upon him, he was stripped of nearly all his clothing, loaded with chains, dragged through the streets of the city and then again thrown into the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of Diomede, where he remained for eighty five days. Perhaps influenced by the death of Paul, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Constantinople</a>, Constans did not sentence the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to death, but to exile. He was put on board a ship, 26 March, 654 (655) and arrived at his destination on 15 May. Cherson was at the time suffering from a great famine. The venerable pontiff here passed the remaining days of his life. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the church of Our Lady, called Blachern&#230;, near Cherson, and many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are related as wrought by St Martin in life and after death. The greater part of his <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are said to have been transferred to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where they repose in the church of San Martino ai Monti. Of his letters seventeen are extant in P.L., LXXXVII, 119.
