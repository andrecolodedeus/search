<h1>Pope St. Miltiades</h1>  

<p>The year of his birth is not known; he was elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in either 310 or 311; died 10 or 11 January, 314. After the banishment of <a href="../cathen/05615b.htm">Pope Eusebius</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> was vacant for some time, probably because of the complications which has arisen on account of the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">apostates (<em>lapsi</em>)</a>, and which were not cleared up by the banishment of <a href="../cathen/05615b.htm">Eusebius</a> and Heraclius. On 2 July, 310 or 311, Miltiadea (the name is also written Melchiades), a native of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, was elevated to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. There is some uncertainty as to the exact year, as the "Liberian Catalogue of the Popes" (Duchesne, <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, I, 9) gives 2 July, 311, as the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (ex die VI non. iul. a cons. Maximiliano VIII solo, quod fuit mense septembri Volusiano et Rufino); but in contradiction to this the death of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is said to have occurred on 2 January, 314, and the duration of the pontificate is given as three years, six months and eight days; possibly owing to the mistake of a copyist, we ought to read "ann. II" instead of "ann. III"; and therefore the year of his elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> was most probably 311. About this time (311 or 310), an edict of toleration signed by the Emperors Galerius, Licinius, and Constantine, put an end to the great <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and they were permitted to live as such, and also to reconstruct their places of religious worship (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250108.htm"><em>Church History</em> VIII.17</a>; Lactantius, <a href="../fathers/0705.htm"><em>How the Persecutors Died</em> 34</a>). Only in those countries of the Orient which were under the sway of Maximinus Daia did the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> continue to be <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. The emperor now gave Pope Miltiades in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to receive back, through the prefect of the city, all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> buildings and possessions which had been confiscated during the persecutions. The two Roman <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, Strato and Cassianus, were ordered by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to discuss this matter with the prefect, and to take over the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church properties</a> (Augustinus, "Breviculus collationis cum Donatistis", iii, 34); it thus became possible to reorganize thoroughly the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration and the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>.

<p>Miltiades caused the remains of his predecessor, <a href="../cathen/05615b.htm">Eusebius</a>, to be brought back from <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and had them <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> in a <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacombs</a> of St. Callistus. In the following year the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> witnessed the final triumph of the Cross, through the defeat of <a href="../cathen/10073b.htm">Maxentius</a>, and the entry into <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> (now <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>), after the victory at the Milvian Bridge (27 October, 312). Later the emperor presented the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> with the Lateran Palace, which then became the residence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and consequently also the seat of the seat of the central administration of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. The basilica which adjoined the palace or was afterwards built there became the principal church of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In 313 the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> came to Constantine with a request to nominate <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from Gaul as judges in the controversy of the African episcopate regarding the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> in Carthage of the two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, C&aelig;cilian and Majorinus. Constantine wrote about this to Miltiades, and also to Marcus, requesting the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with three <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from Gaul to give a hearing in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to C&aelig;cilian and his opponent, and to decide the case. On 2 October, 313, there assembled in the Lateran Palace, under the presidency of Miltiades, a synod of eighteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from Gaul and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, which, after thoroughly considering the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> controversy for three days, decided in favor of C&aelig;cilian, whose election and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> was declared to be legitimate. In the biography of Miltiades, in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, it is stated that at the time <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> were found in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; this was quite possible as <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a> began to be spread in the West in the fourth century. The same source attributes to this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> which absolutely forbade the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to fast on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> or on Thursdays, "because these days were observed by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> as a holy fast". This reason is remarkable; it comes most likely from the author of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> who with this alleged <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> traces back a Roman custom of his own time to an ordinance of Miltiades. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> is probably no less arbitrary in crediting this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> to the effect that the Oblation <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> at the Solemn Mass of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (by which is meant the Eucharistic Bread) should be taken to the different churches in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Such a custom actually existed in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Duchesne, "Christian Worship," London, 1903, 185); but there is nothing definite to show that it was introduced by Miltiades, as the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> asserts.

<p>After his death, on 10 or 11 January (the Liberian Catalogue" give it as III id. jan.; the "Depositio Episcoporum" as IIII id. jan.), 314, Miltiades was laid to rest in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of St. Callistus and he was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a saint. <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a> regards as highly probably his [this] location of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> burial-chamber (Roma Sotterranea, II, 188 sq.). His feast was celebrated in the fourth century, on 10 January, according to the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum". In the present "Roman Martyrology" it occurs on 10 December.
