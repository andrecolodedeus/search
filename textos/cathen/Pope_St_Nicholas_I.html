<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope St. Nicholas I</h1>  

<p>Born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> unknown; died 13 November, 867.

<p>One of the great <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, who exerted decisive influence upon the historical development of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> and its position among the Christian nations of Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>.

<p>He was of a distinguished <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, being the son of the Defensor Theodore, and received an excellent training. Already distinguished for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, benevolence, ability, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and eloquence, he entered, at an early age, the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, was made <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> by <a href="../cathen/13728c.htm">Pope Sergius II</a> (844-47), and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> by <a href="../cathen/09159a.htm">Leo IV</a> (847-55). After <a href="../cathen/02427e.htm">Benedict's</a> death (7 April, 858) the Emperor Louis II, who was in the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, came into the city to exert his influence upon the <a href="../cathen/12270a.htm">election</a>. On 24 April Nicholas was <a href="../cathen/12270a.htm">elected pope</a>, and on the same day was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a> in the presence of the emperor. Three days after, he gave a farewell banquet to the emperor, and afterward, accompanied by the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> nobility, visited him in his camp before the city, on which occasion the emperor came to meet the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and led his horse for some distance.

<p><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> was then in a most melancholy condition. The empire of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> had fallen to pieces, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> territory was threatened both from the north and the east, and <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> seemed on the brink of <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a> was despised; many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were worldly and unworthy of their office. There was danger of a universal decline of the higher civilization. Pope Nicholas appeared as a conscientious representative of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">Primacy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He was filled with a high conception of his mission for the vindication of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morality</a>, the defence of <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a> against powerful <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p>Archbishop John of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> oppressed the inhabitants of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">papal territory</a>, treated his suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> with <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, made <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> demands upon them for money, and illegally <a href="../cathen/12436a.htm">imprisoned</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. He also <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forged</a> documents to support his claims against the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> and maltreated the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>. As the warnings of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> were without result, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> ignored a thrice-repeated summons to appear before the <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">papal tribunal</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Having first visited the Emperor Louis at <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> repaired, with two imperial delegates, to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where Nicholas cited him before the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> assembled in the autumn of 860. Upon this John fled from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Going in person to <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> then investigated and equitably regulated everything. Again appealing to the emperor, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was recommended by him to submit to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, which he did at the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">Synod</a> of November, 861. Later on, however, he entered into a pact with the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> and <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, was himself again <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, and once more forced to make his submission to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>Another conflict arose between Nicholas and <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Archbishop Hincmar of Reims</a>: this concerned the prerogatives of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. Bishop Rothad of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a> had <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appealed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> against the decision of the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">Synod</a> of <a href="../cathen/14130c.htm">Soissons</a>, of 861, which had <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> him; <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar</a> opposed the <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appeal</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, but eventually had to acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> to take cognizance of important <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legal</a> causes (<em>caus&aelig; majores</em>) and pass independent judgment upon them. A further dispute broke out between <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> as to the elevation of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> Wulfad to the <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">archiepiscopal See of Bourges</a>, but here, again, <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar</a> finally submitted to the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decrees</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> passed corresponding <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">ordinances</a>.

<p>Nicholas showed the same <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in other efforts to maintain <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>, especially as to the marriage <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Ingiltrud, wife of Count Boso, had left her husband for a paramour; Nicholas commanded the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the dominions of Charles the Bold to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> her unless she returned to her husband. As she paid no attention to the summons to appear before the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">Synod</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> in 860, she was put under the ban. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was also involved in a desperate struggle with Lothair II of <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a> over the inviolability of marriage. Lothair had abandoned his lawful wife Theutberga to marry Waldrada. At the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">Synod</a> of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>, 28 April, 862, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, unmindful of their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, approved of this illicit union. At the <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">Synod</a> of <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, June, 863, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a>, bribed by the king, assented to the <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> decision, and condemned the absent Theutberga. Upon this the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> brought the matter before his own <a href="../cathen/04447a.htm">tribunal</a>. The two <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/07088a.htm">G&uuml;nther of Cologne</a> and Thietgaud of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, who had come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as delegates, were summoned before the Lateran <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">Synod</a> of October, 863, when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> condemned and <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> them as well as John of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and Hagano of <a href="../cathen/02489c.htm">Bergamo</a>. The Emperor Louis II took up the cause of the <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, while King Lothair advanced upon <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with an army and laid siege to the city, so that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was confined for two days in <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a> without food. Yet Nicholas did not waver in his determination; the emperor, after being reconciled with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, withdrew from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and commanded the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> and <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a> to return to their homes. Nicholas never ceased from his efforts to bring about a reconciliation between Lothair and his lawful wife, but without effect. Another matrimonial case in which Nicholas interposed was that of Judith, daughter of Charles the Bold, who had married Baldwin, Count of <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a>, without her father's consent. <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Judith, and <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar of Reims</a> had taken sides against her, but Nicholas urged leniency, in order to protect freedom of marriage. In many other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, also, he issued letters and decisions, and he took active measures against <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were neglectful of their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>.

<p>In the matter of the emperor and the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of Constantinople Nicholas showed himself the Divinely appointed ruler of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In violation of ecclesiastical law, the Patriarch Ignatius was <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> in 857 and <a href="../cathen/12043b.htm">Photius</a> illegally raised to the patriarchal see. In a letter addressed (8 May, 862) to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of the East, Nicholas called upon them and all their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to refuse recognition to <a href="../cathen/12043b.htm">Photius</a>, and at a <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held in April, 863, he <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/12043b.htm">Photius</a>. He also encouraged the missionary activity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. He sanctioned the union of the Sees of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a> and <a href="../cathen/07121b.htm">Hamburg</a>, and confirmed to <a href="../cathen/01544c.htm">St. Anschar</a>, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02756a.htm">Bremen</a>, and his successors the office of <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> to the Danes, <a href="../cathen/14347a.htm">Swedes</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>. <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a> having been converted by Greek missionaries, its ruler, Prince Boris, in August, 863, sent an embassy to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> with one hundred and six questions on the teaching and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a>. Nicholas answered these inquiries exhaustively in the celebrated "Responsa Nicolai ad consulta Bulgarorum" (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Coll. Conc.", XV, 401 sqq.). The letter shows how keen was his desire to foster the principles of an earnest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life in this newly-converted people. At the same time he sent an embassy to Prince Boris, charged to use their personal efforts to attain the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> object. Nevertheless, Boris finally joined the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>.

<p>At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Nicholas rebuilt and endowed several churches, and constantly sought to encourage <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. His own personal life was guided by a spirit of earnest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> asceticism and profound <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. He was very highly esteemed by the citizens of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as he was by his contemporaries generally (cf. Regino, "Chronicon", ad an. 868, in "Mon. Germ. Hist." Script.", I, 579), and after death was regarded as a saint. A much discussed question and one that is important in judging the position taken by this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is, whether he made use of the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forged</a> <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">pseudo-Isidorian papal decretals</a>. After exhaustive investigation, Schr&ouml;rs has decided that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was neither acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">pseudo-Isidorian collection</a> in its entire extent, nor did he make use of its individual parts; that he had perhaps a general <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05773a.htm">false decretals</a>, but did not base his view of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> upon them, and that he owed his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them solely to documents which came to him from the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire [Schr&ouml;rs, "Papst Nikolaus I. und Pseudo-Isidor" in "Historisches Jahrbuch", XXV (1904), 1 sqq.; Idem, "Die pseudoisidorische 'Exceptio spolii' bei Papst Nikolaus I" in "Historisches Jahrbuch", XXVI (1905), 275 sqq.].
