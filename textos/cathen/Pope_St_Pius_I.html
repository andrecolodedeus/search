<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope St. Pius I</h1>  

<p>Date of birth unknown; <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> from about 140 to about 154. According to the earliest list of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, given by <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103231.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> II.31</a>; cf. Eusebius, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.6</a>), Pius was the ninth <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">successor of St. Peter</a>. The dates given in the Liberian Catalogue for his pontificate (146-61) rest on a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> calculation of earlier chroniclers, and cannot be accepted. The only chronological datum we possess is supplied by the year of <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">St. Polycarp of Smyrna's</a> death, which may be referred with great <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> to 155-6. On his visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the year before his death <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> found Anicetus, the successor of Pius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> there; consequently, the death of Pius must have occurred about 154. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (ed. Duchesne, I, 132) says the father of Pius was Rufinus, and makes him a native of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>; this is, however, probably a conjecture of the author, who had heard of Rufinus of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> (end of fourth century). From a notice in the "Liberian Catalogue" (in Duchesne, <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, I, 5), which is confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/10642a.htm">Muratorian Fragment</a> (ed. Preuschen, "Analecta", I, T&uuml;bingen, 1910), we learn that a brother of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Hermas by name, published "The Shepherd" (see <a href="../cathen/07268b.htm">HERMAS</a>). If the information which the author gives concerning his personal conditions and station (first a slave, then a freedman) were historical, we should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> more about the origin of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, his brother. It is very possible that the story which Hermas relates of himself is a fiction.

<p>During the pontificate of Pius the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> was visited by various <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who sought to propagate their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a> among the faithful of the capital. The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> Valentinus, who had made his appearance under Pope Hyginus, continued to sow his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, apparently not without success. The <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> Cerdon was also active in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at this period, during which <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> arrived in the capital (see <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">MARCIONITES</a>). Excluded from communion by Pius, the latter founded his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> body (<a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a>, <a href="../fathers/0103303.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> III.3</a>). But <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers also visited the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, the most important being <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a>, who expounded the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian teachings</a> during the pontificate of Pius and that of his successor. A great activity thus marks the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which stands clearly conspicuous as the centre of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (ed. cit.) speaks of a decision of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to the effect that Jewish converts to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> should be admitted and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. What this means we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; doubtless the author of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, here as frequently, refers to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> valid in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of his own time. A later legend refers the foundation of the two churches, the <em>titulus Pudentis (ecclesia Pudentiana)</em> and the <em>titulus Praxedis</em>, to the time of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who is also supposed to have built a baptistry near the former and to have exercised episcopal functions there (Acta SS., IV May, 299 sqq.; cf. de Rossi, "Musaici delle chiese di Roma: S. Pudenziana, S. Prassede"). The story, however, can lay no claim to historical credibility. These two churches came into existence in the fourth century, although it is not impossible that they replaced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> houses, in which the faithful of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> assembled for Divine service before the time of Constantine; the legend, however, should not be alleged as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this fact. In many later writings (e.g. the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>) the "Pastor" or "Shepherd" in the work of Hermas is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> accepted as the name of the author, and, since a Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Pastor is assigned an important role in the foundation of these churches, it is quite possible that the writer of the legend was similarly misled, and consequently interwove Pope Pius into his legendary narrative (see <a href="../cathen/12344b.htm">PRAXEDES AND PUDENTIANA</a>). Two letters written to Bishop Justus of Vienne (P.L., V, 1125 sq.; Jaff&eacute;, "Regesta", I, 2nd ed., pp. 7 sq.), ascribed to Pius, are not authentic. The feast of St. Pius I is celebrated on 11 July.
