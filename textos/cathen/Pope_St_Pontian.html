<h1>Pope St. Pontian</h1>  

<p>Dates of birth and death unknown. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (ed. Duchesne, I, 145) gives <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as his native city and calls his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> Calpurnius. With him begins the brief chronicle of the Roman <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the third century, of which the author of the Liberian Catalogue of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> made use in the fourth century and which gives more exact data for the lives of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. According to this account  Pontian was made <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> 21 July, 230, and reigned until 235. The <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> continued during his episcopate; towards the end of his pontificate there was a reconciliation between the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> party and its leader with the Roman <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. After the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> (231-2), a synod was held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, according to Jerome (Epist. XXXII, iv) and Rufinus (Apol. contra Hieron., II, xx), which concurred in the decisions of the Alexandrian synod against <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>; without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> this synod was held by  Pontian (<a href="../cathen/07191a.htm">Hefele</a>, Konziliengeschichte, 2nd ed., I, 106 sq.). In 235 in the reign of Maximinus the Thracian began a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> directed chiefly against the heads of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. One of its first victims was  Pontian, who with <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> was banished to the unhealthy island of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>. To make the election of a new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> possible,  Pontian resigned 28 Sept., 235, the Liberian Catalogue says "discinctus est". Consequently <a href="../cathen/01553a.htm">Anteros</a> was elected in his stead. Shortly before this or soon afterwards <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, who had been banished with  Pontian, became reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>, and with this the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> he had caused came to an end. How much longer  Pontian endured the sufferings of exile and harsh treatment in the <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinian</a> mines is unknown. According to old and no longer existing Acts of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, used by the author of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, he died in consequence of the privations and inhuman treatment he had to bear. Pope Fabian (236-50) had the remains of  Pontian and <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> brought to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> at a later date and  Pontian was buried on 13 August in the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Callistus. In 1909 the original epitaph was found in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a> of <a href="../cathen/03471b.htm">St. Cecilia</a>, near the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>. The epitaph, agreeing with the other known epitaphs of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">crypt</a>, reads: PONTIANOS, EPISK. MARTUR (Pontianus, Bishop, Martyr). The word <em>m&aacute;rtur</em> was added later and is written in ligature [cf. Wilpert, "Die Papstgr&#228;ber und die C&#228;ciliengruft in der Katakombe des hl. Kalixtus" (Freiburg, 1909), 1 sq., 17 sq., Plate III]. He is placed under 13 Aug. in the list of the "Depositiones martyrum" in the chronographia of 354. The Roman Martyrology gives his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> on 19 Nov.
