<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope St. Silverius</h1>  

<p>(Reigned 536-37).

<p>Dates of birth and death unknown. He was the son of Pope Hormisdas who had been married before becoming one of the higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Silverius entered the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and was <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> when Pope Agapetus died at Constantinople, 22 April, 536. The Empress Theodora, who favoured the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> sought to bring about the election as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Vigilius who was then at Constantinople and had given her the desired guarantees as to the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>. However, Theodatus, King of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a>, who wished to prevent the election of a pope connected with Constantinople, forestalled her, and by his influence the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> Silverius was chosen. The election of a <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a> as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a> was unusual. Consequently, it is easy to understand that, as the author of the first part of the life of Silverius in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber pontificalis"</a> (ed. Duchesne, I, 210) relates, a strong opposition to it appeared among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. This, however, was suppressed by Theodatus so that, finally, after Silverius had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (probably on 8 June, 536) all the Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> gave their consent in writing to his elevation. The assertion made by the author just mentioned that Silverius secured the intervention of Theodatus by payment of money is unwarranted, and is to be explained by the writer's hostile opinion of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>. The author of the second part of the life in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber pontificalis"</a> is favourably inclined to Silverius. The pontificate of this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> belongs to an unsettled, disorderly period and he himself fell a victim to the intrigues of the Byzantine Court.

<p>After Silverius had become <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the Empress Theodora sought to win him for the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>. She desired especially to have him enter into communion with the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, Anthimus, who had been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and deposed by Agapetus, and with Severus of Antioch. However, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> committed himself to nothing and Theodora now resolved to overthrow him and to gain the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">papal see</a> for Vigilius. Troublous times befell <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> during the struggle that broke out in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> between the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogoths</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> after the death of Amalasuntha, daughter of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric the Great</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Ostrogothic</a> king, Vitiges, who ascended the throne in August, 536, besieged the city. The churches over the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> outside of the city were devastated, the graves of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> themselves were broken open and <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecrated</a>. In December, 536, the Byzantine general Belisarius garrisoned <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and was received by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in a friendly and courteous manner. Theodora sought to use Belisarius for the carrying out of her plan to depose Silverius and to put in his place the Roman <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Vigilius, formerly apocrisary at Constantinople, who had now gone to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Antonina, wife of Belisarius, influenced her husband to act as Theodora desired. By means of a forged letter the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was accused of a treasonable agreement with the Gothic king who was besieging <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. It was asserted that Silverius had offered the king to leave one of the city gates secretly open so as to permit the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> to enter. Silverius was consequently arrested in March, 537, roughly stripped of his episcopal dress, given the clothing of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> and carried off to exile in the East. Vigilius was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a> in his stead.

<p>Silverius was taken to Lycia where he was went to reside at <a href="../cathen/11541a.htm">Patara</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11541a.htm">Patara</a> very soon discovered that the exiled <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was innocent. He journeyed to Constantinople and was able to lay before the Emperor Justinian such <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the innocence of the exile that the emperor wrote to Belisarius commanding a new investigation of the matter. Should it turn out that the letter concerning the alleged plot in favour of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> was forged, Silverius should be placed once more in possession of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">papal see</a>. At the same time the emperor allowed Silverius to return to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and the latter soon entered the country, apparently at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>. However, Vigilius arranged to take charge of his unlawfully deposed predecessor. He evidently acted in agreement with the Empress Theodora and was aided by Antonina, the wife of Belisarius. Silverius was taken to the Island of Palmaria in the Tyrrhenian Sea and kept their in close confinement. Here he died in consequence of the privations and harsh treatment he endured. The year of his death is unknown, but he probably did not live long after reaching Palmaria. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> on the island, according to the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber pontificalis"</a> on 20 June; his remains were never taken from Palmaria. According to the same witness he was invoked after death by the believers who visited his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">grave</a>. In later times he was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a saint. The earliest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this is given by a list of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the eleventh century (M&eacute;langes d'arch&eacute;ologie et d'histoire, 1893, 169). The "Martyrologium" of Peter de Natalibus of the fourteenth century also contains his feast, which is recorded in the present Roman Martyrology on 20 June.

<p>[<em>Editor's note:</em> According to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">Liber Pontificalis</a>, Pope St. Silverius was exiled not to Palmaria, but rather to the Island of Palmarola, a much smaller and more desolate island near Ponza, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, in the Bay of Naples.]
