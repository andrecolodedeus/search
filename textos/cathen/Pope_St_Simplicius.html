<h1>Pope St. Simplicius</h1>  

<p>Reigned 468-483; <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> of birth unknown; died 10 March, 483. According to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (ed. Duchesne, I, 249) Simplicius was the son of a citizen of <a href="../cathen/14747b.htm">Tivoli</a> named Castinus; and after the death of Pope Hilarius in 468 was elected to succeed the latter. The elevation of the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was not attended with any difficulties. During his pontificate the Western Empire came to an end. Since the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of <a href="../cathen/15255b.htm">Valentinian III</a> (455) there had been a rapid succession of insignificant emperors in the Western Roman Empire, who were constantly threatened by <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and revolution. Following other German tribes the Heruli entered <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and their ruler Odoacer put an end to the Western Empire by deposing the last emperor, Romulus Augustulus, and assuming himself the title of King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Although an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, Odoacer treated the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with much respect; he also retained the greater part of the former administrative organization, so that the change produced no great differences at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> controversy, that was still carried on in the Eastern Empire, Simplicius vigorously defended the independence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against the C&aelig;saropapism of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine</a> rulers and the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> in questions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The twenty-eighth canon of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> (451) granted the See of Constantinople the same privileges of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> that were enjoyed by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Old <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, although the primacy and the highest rank of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> were due to the latter. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> protested against this elevation of the Byzantine Patriarch, and Pope Leo confirmed only the dogmatic decrees of the council. However, the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople sought to bring the canon into force, and the Emperor Leo II desired to obtain its confirmation by Simplicius. The latter, however, rejected the request of the emperor and opposed the carrying out of the canon, that moreover limited the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the old Oriental <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchates</a>.

<p>The rebellion of Basiliscus, who in 476 drove the Emperor Zeno into exile and seized the Byzantine throne, intensified the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> dispute. Basiliscus looked for support to the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, and he granted permission to the deposed <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, Timotheus Ailurus of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> and Peter Fullo of Antioch, to return to their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a>. At the same time he issued a religious edict (<em>Enkyklikon</em>) addressed to Ailurus, which commanded that only the first three ecumenical <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> were to be accepted, and rejected the Synod of Chalcedon and the Letter of Pope Leo. All <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were to sign the edict. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Constantinople, Acacius (from 471), wavered and was about to proclaim this edict. But the firm stand taken by the populace, influenced by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who were rigidly <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in their opinions, moved the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to oppose the emperor and to defend the threatened <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Constantinople united with Pope Simplicius, who made every effort to maintain the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> and the definitions of the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> exhorted to loyal adherence to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in letters to Acacius, to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, as well as to the usurper Basiliscus himself. In a letter to Basiliscus of 10 Jan., 476, Simplicius says of the See of Peter at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>: "This same norm of Apostolic <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is firmly maintained by his (Peter's) successors, of him to whom the Lord entrusted the care of the entire flock of sheep, to whom He promised not to leave him until the end of time" (Thiel, "Rom. Pont.", 182). In the same way he took up with the emperor the cause of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Alexandria</a>, Timotheus Salophakiolus, who had been superseded by Ailurus. When the Emperor Zeno in 477 drove away the usurper and again gained the supremacy, he sent the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a completely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whereupon Simplicius (9 Oct., 477) congratulated him on his restoration to power and exhorted him to ascribe the victory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who wished in this way to restore liberty to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>Zeno recalled the edicts of Basiliscus, banished Peter Fullo from Antioch, and reinstated Timotheus Salophakiolus at <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. He did not disturb Ailurus on account of the latter's great age, and as matter of fact the latter soon died. The <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> now put forward <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Peter Mongus</a>, the former <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> of Ailurus, as his successor. Urged by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the Eastern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, Zeno commanded the banishment of <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Peter Mongus</a>, but the latter was able to hide in <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, and fear of the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> prevented the use of force. In a moment of weakness Salophakiolus himself had permitted the placing of the name of the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> patriarch <a href="../cathen/05019a.htm">Dioscurus</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> to be read at the church services. On 13 March, 478, Simplicius wrote to <a href="../cathen/01082a.htm">Acacius of Constantinople</a> that Salophakiolus should be urged to wipe out the disgrace that he had brought upon himself. The latter sent <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> and letters to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to give satisfaction to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. At the request of Acacius, who was still active against the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> condemned by name the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Mongus</a>, Fullo, Paul of Epheseus, and John of <a href="../cathen/01592b.htm">Apamea</a>, and delegated the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople to be in this his representative. When the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> at Antioch raised a revolt in 497 against the patriarch Stephen II, and killed him, Acacius <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Stephen III, and afterwards Kalendion as Stephen's successors. Simplicius made an energetic demand upon the emperor to punish the murderers of the patriarch, and also reproved Acacius for exceeding his competence in performing this <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>; at the same time, though, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> granted him the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a>. After the death of Salophakiolus, the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> again elected <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Peter Mongus</a> patriarch, while the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> chose Johannes Talaia. Both Acacius and the emperor, whom he influenced, were opposed to Talaia, and sided with <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Mongus</a>. <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Mongus</a> went to Constantinople to advance his cause. Acacius and he agreed upon a formula of union between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysites</a> that was approved by the Emperor Zeno in 482 (<em>Henotikon</em>). Talaia had sent ambassadors to Pope Simplicius to notify the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> of his election. However, at the same time, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> received a letter from the emperor in which Talaia was accused of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> and bribery and a demand was made for the recognition of <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Mongus</a>. Simplicius, therefore, delayed to recognize Talaia, but protested energetically against the elevation of <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Mongus</a> to the Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>. Acacius, however, maintained his alliance with <a href="../cathen/11770a.htm">Mongus</a> and sought to prevail upon the Eastern <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to enter into Church communion with him. For a long time Acacius sent no information of any kind to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, so that the latter in a letter blamed him severely for this. When finally Talaia came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 483 Simplicius was already dead.

<p>Simplicius exercised a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> pastoral care in western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> also, notwithstanding the trying circumstances of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> during the disorders of the Migrations. He issued decisions in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> questions, appointed Bishop Zeno of Seville <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> vicar in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, so that the prerogatives of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">papal see</a> could be exercised in the country itself for the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> administration. When Bishop John of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> in 482 claimed Mutina as a suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of his <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">see</a>, and without more ado <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Bishop George for this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, Simplicius vigorously opposed him and defended the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">papal see</a>. Simplicius established four new churches in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself. A large hall built in the form of a rotunda on the C&aelig;lian Hill was turned into a church and dedicated to St. Stephen; the main part of this building still exists as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Stefano Rotondo. A fine hall near the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Maggiore was given to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and turned by Simplicius into a church dedicated to St. Andrew by the addition of an <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> adorned with <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>; it is no longer in existence (cf. de Rossi, "Bull. di archeol. crist.", 1871, 1-64). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> dedicated to the first <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, St. Stephen, behind the memorial church of San Lorenzo in Agro Verano; this church is no longer standing. He had a fourth church built in the city in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/02216a.htm">St. Balbina</a>, "juxta palatium Licinianum", where her grave was; this church still remains. In order to make sure of the regular holding of church services, of the administration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and of the discipline of penance in the great churches of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> outside the city walls, namely the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter (in the Vatican), of <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul</a> on the Via Ostiensis, and of <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a> on the Via Tiburtina, Simplicius ordained that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of three designated sections of the city should, in an established order, have charge of the religious functions at these churches of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>. Simplicius was buried in St. Peter's on the Vatican. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> gives 2 March as the day of burial (VI non.); probably 10 March (VI id.) should be read. After his death King Odoacer desired to influence the filling of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">papal see</a>. The prefect of the city, Basilius, asserted that before death Pope Simplicius had begged to issue the order that no one should be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> Roman <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> without his consent (cf. concerning the regulation Thiel, "Epist. Rom. Pont.", 686-88). The Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> opposed this edict that limited their right of election. They maintained the force of the edict, issued by the <a href="../cathen/07460a.htm">Emperor Honorius</a> at the instance of <a href="../cathen/02658a.htm">Pope Boniface I</a>, that only that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> should be regarded as the rightful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a> who was elected according to canonical form with Divine approval and universal consent. Simplicius was <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as a saint; his <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is on 2 or 3 March.
