<h1>Pope St. Siricius</h1>  

<p>(384-99).

<p>Born about 334; died 26 November, 399, Siricius was a native of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> name was Tiburtius. Siricius entered the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at an early age and, according to the testimony of the inscription on his <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">grave</a>, was <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lector</a> and then <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> during the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a> (352-66). After the death of Damasus, Siricius was unanimously elected his successor (December, 384) and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> probably on 17 December. Ursinus, who had been a rival to Damasus (366), was alive and still maintained his claims. However, the <a href="../cathen/15255b.htm">Emperor Valentinian III</a>, in a letter to Pinian (23 Feb., 385), gave his consent to the election that had been held and praised the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the newly-elected <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; consequently no difficulties arose. Immediately upon his elevation Siricius had occasion to assert his primacy over the universal Church. A letter, in which questions were asked on fifteen different points concerning <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, penance, church discipline, and the <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy of the clergy</a>, came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> addressed to Pope Damasus by Bishop Himerius of <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Siricius answered this letter on 10 February, 385, and gave the decisions as to the matters in question, exercising with full consciousness his supreme power of authority in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (<a href="../cathen/04454a.htm">Coustant</a>, "Epist. Rom. Pont.", 625 sq.). This letter of Siricius is of special importance because it is the oldest completely preserved <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretal</a> (edict for the authoritative decision of questions of discipline and canon law). It is, however, certain that before this earlier <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> had also issued such <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a>, for Siricius himself in his letter mentions "general decrees" of <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Liberius</a> that the latter had sent to the provinces; but these earlier ones have not been preserved. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> directed Himerius to make known his decrees to the neighbouring provinces, so that they should also be observed there. This <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had very much at heart the maintenance of Church discipline and the observance of canons by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. A Roman synod of 6 January, 386, at which eighty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were present, reaffirmed in nine canons the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on various points of discipline (<a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibacy</a>, etc.). The decisions of the council were communicated by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of North Africa and probably in the same manner to others who had not attended the synod, with the command to act in accordance with them. Another letter which was sent to various churches dealt with the election of worthy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. A synodal letter to the Gallican <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, ascribed by <a href="../cathen/04454a.htm">Coustant</a> and others to Siricius, is assigned to <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Pope Innocent I</a> by other historians (P.L., XIII, 1179 sq.). In all his decrees the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> speaks with the consciousness of his supreme <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority and of his pastoral care over all the churches.

<p>Siricius was also <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to take a stand against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> movements. A Roman <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/08530a.htm">Jovinian</a> came forward as an opponent of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, and the higher merit of <a href="../cathen/03481a.htm">celibate</a> life. He found some adherents among the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. About 390-392 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> held a synod at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, at which <a href="../cathen/08530a.htm">Jovinian</a> and eight of his followers were condemned and excluded from communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The decision was sent to <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, the great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and a friend of Siricius. Ambrose now held a synod of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of upper <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> which, as the letter says, in agreement with his decision also condemned the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> including Bishop Bonosus of <a href="../cathen/13472b.htm">Sardica</a> (390), who was also accused of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the Trinity, maintained the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a> that Mary was not always a virgin. Siricius and Ambrose opposed Bonosus and his adherents and refuted their <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> views. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> then left further proceedings against Bonosus to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a> and the other Illyrian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Like his predecessor Damasus, Siricius also took part in the Priscillian controversy; he sharply condemned the episcopal accusers of Priscillian, who had brought the matter before the secular court and had prevailed upon the usurper Maximus to condemn to death and execute Priscillian and some of his followers. Maximus sought to justify his action by sending to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the proceedings in the case. Siricius, however, <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Bishop Felix of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> who supported Ithacius, the accuser of Priscillian, and in whose city the execution had taken place. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> addressed a letter to the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in which he stated the conditions under which the converted Priscillians were to be restored to communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>According to the life in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (ed. Duchesne, I, 216), Siricius also took severe measures against the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. However, as Duchesne remarks (loc. cit., notes) it cannot be assumed from the writings of the converted Augustine, who was a <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> when he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (383), that Siricius took any particular steps against them, yet Augustine would certainly have commented on this if such had been the case. The mention in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> belongs properly to the life of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Pope Leo I</a>. Neither is it probable, as Langen thinks (Gesch. der r&ouml;m. Kirche, I, 633), that Priscillians are to be understood by this mention of <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, although probably Priscillians were at times called <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> in the writings of that age. The western emperors, including Honorius and <a href="../cathen/15255b.htm">Valentinian III</a>, issued <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, whom they declared to be political offenders, and took severe action against the members of this <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> (Codex Theodosian, XVI, V, various <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>). In the East Siricius interposed to settle the Meletian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; this <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> had continued notwithstanding the death in 381 of Meletius at the Council of Constantinople. The followers of Meletius elected Flavian as his successor, while the adherents of Bishop Paulinus, after the death of this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (388), elected Evagrius. Evagrius died in 392 and through Flavian's management no successor was elected. By the mediation of <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. John Chrysostom</a> and Theophilus of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a> an embassy, led by Bishop <a href="../cathen/01080a.htm">Acacius of Beroea</a>, was sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to persuade Siricius to recognize Flavian and to readmit him to communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the name of Siricius is particularly connected with the <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">basilica</a> over the grave of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> on the Via Ostiensis which was rebuilt by the emperor as a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> of five <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a> during the pontificate of Siricius and was dedicated by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 390. The name of Siricius is still to be found on one of the pillars that was not destroyed in the fire of 1823, and which now stands in the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibule</a> of the side entrance to the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a>. Two of his contemporaries describe the character of Siricius disparagingly. <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">Paulinus of Nola</a>, who on his visit to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 395 was treated in a guarded manner by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, speaks of the <em>urbici pap&aelig; superba discretio</em>, the haughty policy of the Roman <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Epist., V, 14). This action of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is, however, explained by the fact that there had been irregularities in the election and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of Paulinus (Buse, "Paulin von Nola", I, 193). Jerome, for his part, speaks of the "lack of judgment" of Siricius (Epist., cxxvii, 9) on account of the latter's treatment of Rufinus of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, to whom the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had given a letter when Rufinus left <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 398, which showed that he was in communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The reason, however, does not justify the judgment which Jerome expressed against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; moreover, Jerome in his polemical writings often exceeds the limits of propriety. All that is known of the labours of Siricius refutes the criticism of the caustic <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> of Bethlehem. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> gives an incorrect date for his death; he was buried in the <em>c&aelig;meterium</em> of Priscilla on the Via Salaria. The text of the inscription on his grave is known (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Inscriptiones christ. urbis Rom&aelig;", II, 102, 138). His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is celebrated on 26 November. His name was inserted in the Roman Martyrology by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>.
