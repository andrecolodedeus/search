<h1>Pope St. Stephen I</h1>  

<p>Although there is some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the dates connected with the pontificate of Stephen, it is generally believed that he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 12 May, 254, and that he died 2 August, 257. According to the most ancient catalogues, he was a Roman by birth, and the son of Jovius, and there is no reason to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the assertion of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> that Lucius I, when about to be <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a>, made over the care of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to his <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> Stephen (254). Most of what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> regarding Pope Stephen is connected directly or indirectly with the severe teachings of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> Novatus. Concerning his most important work, his defence of the validity of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> against the mistaken opinion of <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> and other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Africa and <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, there is no need to speak now, as the history of this important controversy will be found under <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">BAPTISM</a> and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">SAINT CYPRIAN OF CARTHAGE</a>. Suffice it here to call attention to certain newly discovered letters on the subject by <a href="../cathen/05011a.htm">St. Dionysius of Alexandria</a> ("Eng. Hist. Rev.", Jan., 1910, 111 sq.), and to note, with the late Archbishop Benson of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, that Stephen "triumphed, and in him the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> triumphed, as she deserved" [E.W. Benson, "Cyprian, His Life, His Times, His Works", VIII (London), 1897, 3]. In the early part of his pontificate Stephen was frequently urged by Faustinus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, to take action against Marcian, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Arles, who, attaching himself to doctrines of Novatus, denied communion to the penitent <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsi</a>. For some reason unknown to us Stephen did not move. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gaul accordingly turned to <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, and begged him to write to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. This the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> did in a letter which is our sole source of information regarding this affair (Epp. lxix, lxviii). The <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Bishop of Carthage</a> entreats Stephen to imitate his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyred</a> predecessors, and to instruct the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gaul to condemn Marcian, and to elect another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in his stead. As no more is said by <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> on this affair, it is supposed that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> acted in accordance with his wishes, and that Marcian was deposed. The case of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Martial and <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> also brought Stephen in connection with <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>. As <em>libellatici</em> they had been condemned by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of their province for denying the Faith. At first they acknowledged their guilt, but afterwards appealed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and, deceived by their story, Stephen exerted himself to secure their restoration. Accordingly some of their fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> took their part, but the others laid the case before <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>. An assembly of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">African</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> which he convoked renewed the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a> and Martial, and exhorted the people to enter into communion with their successors. At the same time they were at pains to point out that Stephen had acted as he had done because "situated at a distance, and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> facts of the case" he had been deceived by <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>. Anxious to preserve the tradition of his predecessors in matters of practical charity, as well as of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, Stephen, we are told, relieved in their necessities "all the provinces of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and Arabia". In his days the vestments worn by the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> at Mass and other church services did not differ in shape or material from those ordinarily worn by the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. Stephen, however, is said by the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> to have ordained that the vestments which had been used for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> purposes were not to be employed for daily wear. The same authority adds that he finished his pontificate by <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, but the evidence for this is generally regarded as <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the cemetery of St. Calixtus, whence his body was transferred by <a href="../cathen/11577a.htm">Paul I</a> to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which he had founded in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.
