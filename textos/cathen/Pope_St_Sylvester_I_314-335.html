<h1>Pope St. Sylvester I (314-335)</h1>  

<p>Date of birth unknown; d. 31 December, 335. According to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber pontificalis"</a> (ed. Duchesne, I, 170) he was the son of a Roman named Rufinus; the legendary "Vita beati Sylvestri" calls his mother Justa. After the death of <a href="../cathen/10318a.htm">Miltiades</a> (Melchiades), Sylvester was made <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a> and occupied this position twenty-one years. This was the era of <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>, when the public position of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> so greatly improved, a change which must certainly have been very noticeable at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; it is consequently to be regretted that there is so little authoritative information concerning Sylvester's pontificate. At an early <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> legend brings him into close relationship wtih the first <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperor, but in a way that is contrary to historical fact. These legends were introduced especially into the "Vita beati Sylvestri" (Duchesne, loc. cit., Introd., cix sq.) which appeared in the East and has been preserved in Greek, Syriac, and Latin in the "Constitutum Sylvestri"&mdash;an <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> account of an alleged Roman council which belongs to the Symmachian forgeries and appeared between 501 and 508, and also in the "Donatio Constantini". The accounts given in all these writings concerning the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Sylvester, the healing and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Constantine, the emperor's gift to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> granted to the latter, and the council of 275 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, are entirely legendary. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, however, took part in the negotiations concerning <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nic&aelig;a</a>, and the expression <em>&lsquo;omoo&uacute;sion</em> was probably agreed upon with him before the council. The pontiff also sent <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> to the first &aelig;cumenical council. Still it is not certain whether Constantine had arranged beforehand with Sylvester concerning the actual convening of the council, nor whether there was an express <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation of the decrees beyond the signatures of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> (cf. Funk in "Kirchengesch. Abhandlungen und Untersuchungen", I, 95, 501 sq.).

<p>During Sylvester's pontificate were built the great churches founded at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by Constantine, e.g. the basilica and <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> of the Lateran near the former imperial palace where the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> lived, the basilica of the Sessorian palace (Santa Croce), the Church of St. Peter in the Vatican, and several cemeterial churches over the graves of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> helped towards the construction of these churches. Sylvester's memory is especially connected with the titular Church of Equitius, which takes its name from a Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> who is said to have erected this church on his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. It was situated near the <em>therm&aelig;</em> of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a>, and still exists. Parts of the present building may date from the fourth century. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> contributed to the development of the liturgy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. During his reign, moreover, the first <a href="../cathen/09741a.htm">martyrology</a> of Roman <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> was probably drawn up. Sylvester is connected also with the establishment of the Roman <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of singing. on the Via Salaria he built a cemeterial church over the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of Priscilla, the ruins of which have lately been brought to light. In this church he was buried. His <a href="../cathen/06021b.htm">feast</a> is given under 31 December in the "Depositio episcoporum", or list of the burial days of the Roman <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, which was compiled barely a year after his death; the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> is given in the "Calendar" of Philocalus. This day, therefore, is doubtless the day of his burial. For his possible relations with <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenia</a>, see <a href="../cathen/07023a.htm">G<font size=-2>REGORY THE</font> I<font size=-2>LLUMINATOR</font></a>.
