<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope St. Symmachus (498-514)</h1>  

<p>Date of birth unknown; d. 19, July, 514. According to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber pontificalis"</a> (ed. Duchesne, I, 260) he was a native of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> was named Fortunatus. Symmachus was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Thiel, "Epist. pont. rom.", I, 702), entered the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. Directly after the death of Pope Anastasius II, Symmachus was elected his successor by a majority of the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> at the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran Basilica</a> on 22 November, 498. The election was approved by a part of the Roman senate and he was at once <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>. Later on the same day a minority of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who were friendly to the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> and were supported by a party in the Senate met in the Basilica of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Maggiore and elected the Roman archpresbyter Laurentius as <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>. According to Theodorus Lector (P.G., LXXXVI, 193), the Laurentian party was aided with money supplied chiefly by the rich Senator Festus, who hoped that Laurentius would be influenced by this to sign the "Henotikon", the edict of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Emperor Zeno. The other authorities do not speak of such motives, which are very probable, and the testimony of Theodorus can very readily be accepted. Both parties, however, agreed that the two candidates should appear at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> before the Gothic king <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>, the ruler of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and abide by his decision. <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> pronouncing in favour of Symmachus on the ground that he was elected first and by the majority of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, Laurentius submitted to the decision. At a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 1 March, 499, the Acts of which have been preserved, Symmachus, who was now universally acknowledged, bestowed on Laurentius the <a href="../cathen/11086c.htm">Diocese of Nocera</a> in Campania. The synod <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> that any Roman cleric who sought to gain votes for a successor to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> during the lifetime of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, or who called conferences and held consultations for that purpose, should be deposed. <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">King Theodoric</a> was given a vote of thanks by acclamation for his unpartisan decision. When the king came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the following year he had a brilliant reception both from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the people. However, the Byzantine party, headed by the two senators Festus and Probinus, did not abandon its hostility and hope of overthrowing the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and gaining the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">papal see</a> for Laurentius. The opportunity occurred in the following year, 501. Pope Symmachus celebrated <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> on 25 March, following the old Roman cycle, while the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> and others observed the feast on 22 April, according to a new reckoning. The Laurentian party appealed to <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">King Theodoric</a> against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, making other accusations besides this digression in the celebration of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> summoned the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and Symmachus set out to meet him. At <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a> Symmachus learned the contents of the indictment and, refusing to acknowledge the king as his judge, returned home. The opposing party now accused him of squandering the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a> and other matters. It gained in strength and occupied the Lateran palace, so that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to live near the Church of St. Peter outside the city walls. His opponents requested the king to call a synod for the investigation of the accusations and to appoint a visitor for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Symmachus agreed to the calling of a synod, but he and his adherents protested against the sending of a visitor. <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>, however, sent as visitor Bishop Peter of Altinum in upper <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, who was to administer the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> in the place of the accused <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Peter came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and, contrary to the commands of king, allowed himself to be won over by the adherents of Laurentius, so that <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> at a later date dismissed him. Not long after <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, between May and July, 502, the synod met in the basilica of Julius (Santa Maria in Trastevere). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> declared before the synod that it had been called with his consent and that he was ready to answer the accusations before it, if the visitor were removed and he were re-established as the administrator of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. To this the majority of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> agreed and sent an embassy to the king to demand the execution of these conditions. <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>, however, refused, and demanded, first of all, an investigation of the accusations against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. A second session of the synod was held, therefore, on 1 September, 502, in the Sessorian basilica (Santa Croce in Gerusalemme), and the minority had the indictment made by the Laurentian party read aloud. Symmachus desired to go from St. Peter's to the synod in order to defend himself, but on the way there he was attacked by his opponents and maltreated, and, escaping only with great difficulty, returned to St. Peter's; several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who were with him were killed or severely wounded. The <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> sent by <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> promised him a reliable escort but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> now refused to appear before the synod, although invited three times. Consequently the assembled <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> declared at the third session, held about the middle of September, they could not pass judgment upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, because he had appeared twice before his judges, and because there was no precedent showing that an occupant of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> had been subjected to the judgment of other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. They called upon the opposing <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> to submit to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and requested the king to permit the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to return to their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. All these steps were in vain; the majority of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people sided indeed with Symmachus, but a minority of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and a majority of the Senators were at that time partizans of Laurentius. A fourth session, therefore, was held on 23 October, 502, called the "Synodus Palmaris" (Palmary synod) either from the place where it was held (<em>ad Palmata, Palma</em>), or because it was the most important session (<em>palmaris</em>). At this session it was decided that on account of the reasons given earlier the decision must be left to the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; Symmachus was to be regarded as free from all the crimes of which he was accused, and therefore entitled to the full exercise of his episcopal office; the whole <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the church was to be transferred to him; whoever returned to his obedience should escape punishment, but whoever undertook <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> functions at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> without <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> permission was to be regarded as a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a>. The decision was signed by seventy-five <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, among them the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. Many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> now returned to their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. The majority, however, met with the Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in St. Peter's for a fifth session under the presidency of Symmachus on 6 November, 502. The edict issued by the prefect Basilius, in 483, regulating the administration of the possessions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was declared invalid and Symmachus issued a new edict respecting the administration of this <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and especially in regard to its sale.



<p><a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">King Theodoric</a>, not satisfied with the decision of the synod, although the great majority of the Italian episcopate was on the side of the rightful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, did nothing to carry out the new ordinances. Consequently the opposition called its candidate Laurentius again to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He resided in the Lateran palace, which was in the hands of his adherents, while Symmachus retained the house of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (<em>episcopium</em>) near St. Peter's. The division continued for four years, during which both parties carried on a furious quarrel at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Laurentius had his portrait added to the series of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">Church of Saint Paul Without the Walls</a>. However, certain prominent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> exerted their influence in favour of Symmachus, as Bishop Avitus of Vienne, who, at the request of the Gallican <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, addressed an urgent letter to the Senate on behalf of the rightful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and for the restoration of unity. Symmachus gradually won over a number of adherents of the opposition. The greatest factor in the healing of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was the interposition of Deacon Dioscurus of <a href="../cathen/01300a.htm">Alexandria</a>, who had come to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was commissioned by Symmachus to go to <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>, and won the king over to the side of the rightful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Apparently political motives were involved, as the king wished to take action against the Laurentian party, which inclined to Constantinople. He commanded Senator Festus, the head of the hostile party, to return all Roman churches to Symmachus. Laurentius having lost many adherents among the senators the king's command was executed without difficulty. The <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, retired to a farm belonging to his protector Festus. Only a small party still held to Laurentius and refused to recognize Symmachus as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Bishop of Rome</a>; but it was insignificant and was reconciled later to Hormisdas, the successor of Symmachus. During the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> a number of polemical writings appeared, as from the party of Laurentius the treatise "Contra Synodum absolutionis incongruae", to which Deacon Ennodius replied in "Libellus adversus eos qui contra Synodum scribere praseumpserunt" ("Mon. Germ. Hist.: Auct. ant.", VII, 48 sq.). While the author of the life of Symmachus in the completely preserved text of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber pontificalis"</a> is very favourable to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, the writer of another continuation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> biographies supports the cause of Laurentius ("Fragment Laurentine", ed. Duchesne in <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber pontificalis"</a>, I, 44-46). During the dispute the adherents of Symmachus drew up four <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> writings called the "Symmachian Forgeries"; these were: "Gesta synodi Sinuessanae de Marcellino"; "Constitutum Silvestri", "Gesta Liberii"; "Gesta de purgatione Xysti et Polychronii accusatione". These four works are to be found in <a href="../cathen/04454a.htm">Coustant</a>, "Epist. rom. pontif." (Paris, 1721), appendix, 29 sq.; cf. Duchesne, <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber pontificalis"</a>, I, introduction, CXXXIII sq.: "Histoire litt&eacute;raire des apocryphes symmachiens". The object of these forgeries was to produce alleged instances from earlier times to support the whole procedure of the adherents of Symmachus, and, in particular, the position that the Roman <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> could not be judged by any court composed of other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Still these forgeries are not the first documents to maintain this latter tenet.

<p>Symmachus <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> defended the supporters of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> during the disorders of the <a href="../cathen/01082a.htm">Acacian</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. He defends, although without success, the opponents of the "Henotikon" in a letter to Emperor Anastasius I (491-518). At a later date many of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> oriental <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> addressed themselves to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to whom they sent a confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Shortly after 506 the emperor sent him a letter full of invectives, to which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sent a firm answer, maintaining forcibly the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and liberty of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (Thiel, "Epist. rom. pont.", I, 700 sq.). In a letter of 8 October, 512, addressed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyria</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> warned the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of that province not to hold communion with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Soon after the beginning of his pontificate Symmachus interposed in the quarrel between the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a> of Arles and Vienne as to the boundaries of their respective territories. He annulled the edict issued by Anastasius II in favour of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Vienne and later (6 November, 513) confirmed the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> <a href="../cathen/03135b.htm">Caesarius of Arles</a>, as these had been fixed by <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a>. Moreover, he granted Caesarius the privilege of wearing the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, the first-known instance of such a grant by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> outside of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In a letter of 11 June, 514, he appointed Caesarius to represent the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> both in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, to hold <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in certain cases, to give letters of recommendation to <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who journeyed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. More important matters were to be laid before the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. In the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber pontificalis"</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> took severe measures against the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, ordered the burning of their books, and expelled them from the city. He erected or restored and adorned various churches. Thus he built a Church of St. Andrew near St. Peter's, a Basilica of St. Agnes on the Via Aurelia, adorned the Church of St. Peter's, completely rebuilt the Basilica of Sts. Sylvester and Martinus, and made improvements over the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacomb</a> of the Jordani on the Via Salaria. He built episcopal houses (<em>episcopia</em>) to the right and left of the parvis of <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">St. Peter's</a>. These buildings were evidently connected with the residence of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for several years near St. Peter's during the disorders of the Laurentian <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. He also built asylums for the poor near the three churches of St. Peter, St. Paul, and St. Laurence that were outside the city walls. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> contributed large sums for the support of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Africa who were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/15268b.htm">Vandals</a>. He also aided the inhabitants of the provinces of upper <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> who suffered so sorely from the invasion of the barbarians. After his death he was buried at St. Peter's. Symmachus is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> as a saint.
