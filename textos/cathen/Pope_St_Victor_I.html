<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope St. Victor I</h1>  

<p>(189-198 or 199), date of birth unknown. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> makes him a native of Africa and gives his father the name of Felix. This authority, taking the "Liberian Catalogue" as its basis, gives the years 186-197 as the period of Victor's <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">episcopate</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a> text of the <a href="../cathen/05616a.htm">"Chronicle" of Eusebius</a> (Leipzig, 1911, p. 223) places the beginning of Victor's pontificate in the seventh year of the reign of the <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Emperor Commodus</a> (180-87) and gives it a duration of twelve years; in his "Church History" (V, xxxii, ed. Schwarts, <a href="../cathen/09138b.htm">Leipzig</a>, 1902, p. 486) <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> transfers the beginning of the pontificate to the tenth year of the reign of <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Commodus</a> and makes it last ten years.

<p>During the closing years of the reign of <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Commodus</a> (180-192) and the early years of <a href="../cathen/13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a> (from 193) the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> Church enjoyed in general great external peace. The favourable opinion of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> held by <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Commodus</a> is ascribed to the influence of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> named Marcia. According to the testimony of Hippolytus ("Philosophumena", IX, 12) she had been brought up by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Hyacinthus, was very favourably inclined towards the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, perhaps even a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> herself (<a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>, loc. cit., calls her <em>philotheos</em> God-loving). One day she summoned Pope Victor to the imperial palace and asked for a list of the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who had been condemned to forced labour in the mines of <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a>, so that she might obtain their freedom. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> handed her the list and Marcia, having received from the <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">emperor</a> the required pardon, sent the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Hyacinthus to <a href="../cathen/13473b.htm">Sardinia</a> with an order of release for the <a href="../cathen/04215a.htm">Christian confessors</a>. <a href="../cathen/03183d.htm">Callistus</a>, afterwards <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who had been among those deported, did not return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but remained at Antium, where he received a monthly pension from the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> (<a href="../fathers/0103430.htm"><em>Against Heresies</em> IV.30.1</a>) points out that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were employed at this period as officials of the imperial Court. Among these officials was the imperial freedman Prosenes, whose gravestone and epitaph have been preserved (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Inscriptiones christ. urbis Romae", I, 9, no. 5). <a href="../cathen/13721a.htm">Septimius Severus</a>, also, during the early years of his reign, regarded the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> kindly, so that the influence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> officials continued. The <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">emperor</a> retained in his palace a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> named Proculus who had once cured him. He protected <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of rank against the excesses of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> rabble, and his son <a href="../cathen/03328c.htm">Caracalla</a> had a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> wet nurse (<a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, "Ad Scapulam", IV). <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> made great advances in the capital and also found adherents among the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> who were distinguished for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and noble descent (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.21</a>).

<p>Internal dissensions during this era affected the Church at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The dispute over the celebration of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/05228a.htm">EASTER CONTROVERSY</a>) grew more acute. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, who had come from the province of Asia, were accustomed to observe <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> on the 14th day of Nisan, whatever day of the week that date might happen to fall on, just as they had done at home. This difference inevitably led to trouble when it appeared in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Pope Victor decided, therefore, to bring about unity in the observance of the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter festival</a> and to persuade the Quartodecimans to join in the general practice of the Church. He wrote, therefore, to Bishop Polycrates of Ephesus and induced the latter to call together the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province of Asia in order to discuss the matter with them. This was done; but in the letter sent by Polycrates to Pope Victor he declared that he firmly held to the Quartoceciman custom observed by so many celebrated and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of that region. Victor called a meeting of Italian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, which is the earliest <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> known. He also wrote to the leading <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the various districts, urging them to call together the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of their sections of the country and to take counsel with them on the question of the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter festival</a>. Letters came from all sides: from the synod in Palestine, at which Theophilus of Caesarea and Narcissus of Jerusalem presided; from the synod of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> over which Palmas as the oldest presided; from the communities in Gaul whose <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Irenaeus of Lyons; from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Kingdom of Osrhoene; also from individual <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, as Bakchylus of Corinth. These letters all unanimously reported that <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> was observed on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a>. Victor, who acted throughout the entire matter as the head of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>, now called upon the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province of Asia to abandon their custom and to accept the universally prevailing practice of always celebrating <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a>. In case they would not do this he declared they would be excluded from the fellowship of the Church.

<p>This severe procedure did not please all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus of Lyons</a> and others wrote to Pope Victor; they blamed his severity, urged him to maintain peace and unity with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, and to entertain affectionate feelings toward them. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> reminded him that his predecessors had indeed always maintained the Sunday observance of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, as was right, but had not broken off friendly relations and communion with <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> because they followed another custom (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.23-25</a>). We have no information concerning the further course of the matter under Victor I so far as it regards the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. All that is known is that in the course of the third century the Roman practice in the observance of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> became gradually universal. In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself, where Pope Victor naturally enforced the observance of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> on Sunday by all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the capital, an Oriental named Blastus, with a few followers, opposed the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and brought about a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, which, however, did not grow in importance (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, loc. cit., B, xx). Pope Victor also had difficulties with a Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> named Florinus, who probably came from <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>. As an official of the imperial court, Florinus had become acquainted in <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a> with <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a>, and later was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. He fell into the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic heresy</a> and defended the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> learning of Valentine. St. Iren&aelig;us wrote two treatises against him: "On the Monarchy [of God] and that God is not the Author of Evil", and "On the Ogdoad". <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Irenaeus</a> also called Victor's attention to the dangerous writings of Florinus, who was probably degraded from his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and expelled from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.25.20</a>).

<p>During the pontificate of Victor a rich <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, Theodotus the Leather-seller, came from Constantinople to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and taught <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrines</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Whom he declared to be merely a man endowed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, with <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> power. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> condemned this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and excluded Theodotus from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The latter, however, would not submit, but, together with his adherents, formed a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> party, which maintained itself for a time at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Victor may also have come into contact with the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a>. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> reports ("Ad Praceam", 1) that a Roman <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whose name he does not give, had declared his acceptance of the prophecies of Montanus, but had been persuaded by <a href="../cathen/12344a.htm">Praxeas</a> to withdraw. Duchesne ("Histoire ancienne de l'&eacute;glise", I, 278) and others think <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> means Pope Eleutherius, but many investigators consider it more probable that he meant Pope Victor, because the latter had had much to do with the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, and because, between 190 and 200, Praceas had gone from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, where he was opposed by <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>. The question cannot be decided positively.

<p>Jerome calls Pope Victor the first Latin writer in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (Chronicon, ad an. Abr. 2209); he mentions small treatises (<em>mediocria de religione volumina</em>, loc. cit.; cf. "De viris illustribus", XXXIV: "Victor, thirteenth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Roman city, the writer of certain <em>opuscula</em> on the <a href="../cathen/05228a.htm">paschal question</a> and others, ruled the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ten years under Severus"). Besides the letters touching the <a href="../cathen/05228a.htm">Easter controversy</a> none of St. Victor's works is known. Harnack tried to prove that he was the author of the treatise against the dice-throwers ("De alcatoribus"), <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> ascribed to <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (see "Texte und Untersuchungen," V, Leipzig, 1899), though the opinion is how universally rejected (cf. Harnack, "Geschichte der altchristl. Literatur", II, pt. II, 370). It was during Victor's administration, perhaps, that the canon of Scripture used at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and which has been partially preserved in the <a href="../cathen/10642a.htm">Muratorian Fragment</a>, was drawn up. In the note concerning him in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (ed. Duchesne, I, 137) the <a href="../cathen/05228a.htm">Easter controversy</a> is also mentioned; in addition, the introduction of <em>sequentes</em> among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> is also attributed to him. It is not certain what this means, whether it applies to the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>, or to the assistants who appeared later at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for such <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> as were much occupied with the administration of their cures. In any case the note is one of those which the author arbitrarily inserted into the biographies of the various <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, and has, accordingly, no historical value. The same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the ordinance respecting the administration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in cases of necessity ascribed to Pope Victor by the same author.
