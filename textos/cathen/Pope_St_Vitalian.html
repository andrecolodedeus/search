<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope St. Vitalian</h1>  

<p>(Reigned 657-72).

<p>Date of birth unknown; d. 27 January, 672. Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of Vitalian's life before he was raised to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. According to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (ed. Duchesne, I, 343) he was a native of <a href="../cathen/13683b.htm">Segni</a> in Campagna, and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> name was Anastasius. After the death of <a href="../cathen/05598a.htm">Pope Eugene I</a>, on 2 or 3 June, 657, Vitalian was elected his successor, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> on 30 July. Like his predecessor, Vitalian sought to restore the connection with Constantinople by friendly advances to the Eastern Emperor Constans II (641-668) and to prepare the way for the settlement of the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite</a> controversy. He sent letters (<em>synodica</em>) announcing his elevation by envoys both to the emperor and to Patriarch Peter of Constantinople, who was inclined to <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a>. The emperor confirmed the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and sent to St. Peter as a present a codex of the Gospels in a cover of gold richly ornamented with precious stones. The Patriarch Peter also sent an answer, though not a definite one, as to <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a>, which he sought to defend. He made it appear that he was of the same opinion as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who in writing to Peter had expounded the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> intercourse between <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Constantinople was restored on the basis of this mutual reserve over the dogmatic question, and Vitalian's name was entered on the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a>---the only name of a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> so entered between the reign of Honorius I (d. 638) and the Sixth &OElig;cumenical Council of 680-81). Vitalian also showed the same friendliness to the Emperor Constans II, when the latter, in 663, came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and spent twelve days there during the campaign against the Lombards. On 5 July the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, accompanied by the Roman <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, went as far as the sixth milestone to meet the emperor and accompanied him to St. Peter's, where the emperor offered gifts. On the following Sunday Constans went in state to St. Peter's, offered a <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> wrought with gold, and was present during the Mass celebrated by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The emperor dined with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on the following Saturday, attended Mass again on Sunday at St. Peter's, and after Mass took leave of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. At his departure Constans carried off a large number of bronze works of art from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, taking even the bronze tiles from the roof of the Pantheon, which had been dedicated to <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Christian worship</a>. Constans stopped in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, where he cruelly oppressed the population, and was assassinated at <a href="../cathen/14395b.htm">Syracuse</a> in 668. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> supported his son Constantine IV Pogonatus against a usurper and thus aided him to attain the Byzantine throne. The new emperor had no intention of using force to maintain the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> (<em>typus</em>) of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, and Pope Vitalian probably made use of this inclination to take a more decided stand against <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a> and to win the emperor to <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. In this latter attempt, however, he was not able to succeed. The <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite</a> patriarch Theodore of Constantinople (from 678) even removed Vitalian's name from the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a>. It was not until the Sixth &OElig;cumenical Council (681) that <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a> was suppressed, and Vitalian's name was replaced on the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04312d.htm">Byzantine Church</a>.

<p>Pope Vitalian was very successful in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where disputes still divided the Anglo-Saxon and the British <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, respecting various <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> customs. At the <a href="../cathen/15610a.htm">Synod of Streaneshalch (Whitby)</a> King Oswy of Northumberland decided for the general acceptance of the Roman practices in regard to the keeping of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, and the shape of the <a href="../cathen/14779a.htm">tonsure</a>. Together with King Egbert of Kent, he sent the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Wighard to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> there after the death of Archbishop Deusdedit of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> in 664, but Wighard died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> of the pestilence. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> wrote a letter to King Oswy promising to send a suitable <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> as soon as possible. Hadrian, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> near <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, was selected to go, but he considered himself unworthy to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. At his recommendation a highly <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, Theodore of <a href="../cathen/14461b.htm">Tarsus</a>, who understood both Latin and Greek and who was at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, was chosen as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 26 March, 668. Accompanied by Abbot Hadrian, Theodore went to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he was recognized as the head of the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> by all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, Saxon and British. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> confirmed to him all the privileges that <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> had formerly granted to Archbishop Augustine.

<p>The archiepiscopal See of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> was <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Archbishop Maurus of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> (648-71) sought to rid himself of this dependence, and make his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> autocephalous. When Pope Vitalian called upon him to justify his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> views, he refused to obey and declared himself independent of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him, but Maurus did not submit, and even went so far as to <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The Emperor Constans II sided with the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, issued an edict removing the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> from the patriarchal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and ordained that the former should receive the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from the emperor. The successor of Maurus, Reparatus, was in fact <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, in 671, by three of his suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and received the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> from the emperor. It was not until the reign of <a href="../cathen/09157a.htm">Pope Leo II</a> (682-83) that the independence of the See of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> was suppressed: Emperor Constantine IV repealed the edict of Constans and confirmed the ancient <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> over the See of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. Vitalian also had occasion to enforce his authority as supreme judge in the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a>. Bishop John of Lappa in Crete, deposed by a synod under the presidency of the Metropolitan Paulus, appealed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> for so doing. He escaped, however, and went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where Vitalian held a synod in December, 667, to investigate the matter, basing its action on the records of the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> Synod of Crete, and pronounced John guiltless. Vitalian wrote to the Metropolitan Paulus demanding the restoration of John to his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and the return of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> which had been <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> taken from him. At the same time the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> directed the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> to remove two <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> who had married after <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>. Vitalian also wrote respecting John to an imperial official and to Bishop George of Syracuse, who had supported the deposed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Some of the letters attributed to this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> are spurious. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> at St. Peter's.
