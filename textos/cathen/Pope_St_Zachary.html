<h1>Pope St. Zachary</h1>  

<p>(ZACHARIAS.)

<p>Reigned 741-52. Year of birth unknown; died in March, 752. Zachary sprang from a Greek <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> living in Calabria; his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a>, was called Polichronius. Most probably he was a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> and as such signed the decrees of the Roman council of 732. After the burial of his predecessor <a href="../cathen/06789a.htm">Gregory III</a> on 29 November, 741, he was immediately and unanimously elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> and <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> on 5 December. His biographer in the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> describes him as a man of gentle and conciliatory character who was charitable towards the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people. As a fact the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> always showed himself to be shrewd and conciliatory in his actions and thus his undertakings were very successful. Soon after his elevation he notified Constantinople of his election; it is noticeable that his <em>synodica</em> (letter) was not addressed to the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">iconoclastic</a> Patriarch Anastasius but to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople. The envoys of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> also brought a letter for the emperor. After the death of Leo III (18 June, 741) his successor was his son Constantine V, Copronymus. However, in 742 Constantine's brother-in-law Artabasdus raised a revolt against the new emperor and established himself in Constantinople; thus when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> envoys reached Constantinople they found Artabasdus the ruler there. As late as 743 the <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letters</a> were dated from the year of the reign of Constantine V; in 744, however, they are <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> form the year of the reign of Artabasdus. Still the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> envoys do not seem to have come into close relations with the usurper at Constantinople, although the latter re-established the worship of images. After Constantine V had overthrown his rival, the envoys of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> presented to him the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> letter in which Zachary exhorted the emperor to restore the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in respect to the worship of images. The emperor received the envoys in a friendly manner and presented the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> with the villages of Nympha and Normia (Norba) in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, which with their territories extended to the sea.

<p>When Zachary ascended the throne the position of the city and Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was a very serious one. Luitprand, King of the Lombards, was preparing a new incursion into Roman territory. Duke Trasamund of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, with whom <a href="../cathen/06789a.htm">Pope Gregory III</a> had formed an alliance against Luitprand, did not keep his promise to aid the Romans in regaining the cities taken by the Lombards. Consequently Zachary abandoned the alliance with Trasamund and sought to protect the interests of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and Roman territory by personal influence over Luitprand. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> went to <a href="../cathen/10704a.htm">Terni</a> to see the Lombard king who received him with every mark of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Zachary was able to obtain from Luitprand that the four cities of Ameria, Horta, Polimartium, and Blera should be returned to the Romans, and that all the patrimonies of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> that the Lombards had taken from it within the last thirty years, should be given back; he was also able to conclude a truce for twenty years between the Roman Duchy and the Lombards. A <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> to the Saviour was built in the Church of St. Peter at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the name of Luitprand, in which the deeds respecting this return of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> were placed. After the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> return, the Roman people went in solemn procession to St. Peter's to thank <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the fortunate result of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> efforts. Throughout the entire affair the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appears as the secular ruler of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the Roman territory. In the next year Luitprand made ready to attack the territory of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. The Byzantine <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> begged Pope Zachary to intervene. The latter first sent envoys to the Lombard king, and when these were unsuccessful he went himself to <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and from there to Pavia to see Luitprand. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> reached Pavia on the eve of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul. He celebrated the vigil and the feast of the princes of the Apostles at <a href="../cathen/11592b.htm">Pavia</a>, and was able to induce the king to abandon the attack on <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and to restore the territory belonging to the city itself. Luitprand died shortly after than and after his first successor Hildebrand was overthrown, Ratchis became King of the Lombards. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was on the best of terms with him. In 749 the new king confirmed the treaty of peace with the Roman Duchy. The same year Ratchis abdicated, with his wife and daughter took the <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and all three entered the monastic life.

<p>In 743 Pope Zachary held a synod at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> which was attended by sixty <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. This synod issued fourteen canons on various matters of church discipline. On this occasion the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> took up the question of the impediments to marriage of relationship in the fourth degree, in regard to which the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> claimed to have obtained a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from <a href="../cathen/06787a.htm">Pope Gregory II</a>. The year previous Zachary had written on this point to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and kings of that province. An active correspondence was kept up between Zachary and <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>. The latter in his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> labours had organized the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the German territories, and while doing this had kept in close connection with the Papal See. Early in 742, soon after his elevation, Zachary received a letter from <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> in which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> expressed his full submission to the possessor of the Chair of Peter and requested then confirmation of the three newly established <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of Wurzburg, Buraburg, and Erfurt; <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> also sought authority to hold a synod in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and to suppress abuses in the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> confirmed the three <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and commissioned <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> to attend, as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> synod which Karlmann wished to hold. In a later letter Zachary confirmed the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>, <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, and Sens appointed by <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a>, and also confirmed the condemnation of the two <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> Adelbert and Clement. Various questions in which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> disagreed were discussed in letters. In 745 was held the general synod for the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> kingdom called by Pepin and Carloman. Here decrees were passed against unworthy <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a>, and the two <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, Adelbert and Clement, were again condemned. <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> sent a <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to make a report to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and the latter held on 25 October, 745, a synod at the Lateran at which, after exhaustive investigation, an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> was pronounced against the two <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Zachary forwarded the acts of the synod with a letter to <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a>. Pepin and the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> sent a list of questions respecting the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> population to Pope Zachary, and the latter answered in a letter of 746 in which decisions respecting the various points are given. These decisions were communicated to <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> so that he might make them generally known at a <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> synod. The following year, 747, Carloman resigned his authority and the world, went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and was received by Pope Zachary into a monastic order. At first he lived in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the Soracte, later at <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>. Thanks to the efforts of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> all the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were now agreed in submission to the See of St. Peter. Zachary sent still other letters to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Gaul and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and also to <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> as the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of this region. <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">Boniface</a> was constantly in intercourse with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> both by letters and envoys and sent important questions to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for decision. An important <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the recognition by the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> of the high moral power of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> is shown by the appeal to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> authority on the occasion of the overthrow of the Merovingian dynasty. Pepin's ambassadors, Bishop Burkard of Wurzburg and Chaplain Folrad of St. Denis, laid the question before Zachary: whether it seemed right to him that one should be king who did not really possess the royal power. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> declared that this did not appear good to him, and on the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> Pepin considered himself justified in having himself proclaimed King of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">SAINT BONIFACE</a>; and <a href="../cathen/11662b.htm">PEPIN THE SHORT</a>). The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> activity of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> also extended to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Through his efforts the Synod of Cloveshove was held in 747 for the reform of church discipline in accordance with the advice given by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and in imitation of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>.

<p>Zachary was very <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in the restoration of the churches of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to which he made costly gifts. He also restored the Lateran palace and established several large domains as the settled landed possessions (<em>domus cult&aelig;</em>) of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> translated to the Church of St. George in Velabro the head of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> <a href="../cathen/06453a.htm">St. George</a> which was found during the repairs of the decayed Lateran Palace. He was very benevolent to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, to whom <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> were given regularly from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> palace. When merchants from <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> bought slaves at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in order to sell them again to the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> bought all the slaves, so that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> should not become the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>. Thus in a troubled era Zachary proved himself to be an excellent, capable, vigorous, and charitable successor of Peter. He also carried on <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies and made a translation of the Dialogues of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> into Greek, which was largely circulated in the East. After his death Zachary was buried in St. Peters.
