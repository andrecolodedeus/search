<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope St. Zephyrinus</h1>  

<p>(Reigned 198-217).

<p>Date of birth unknown; died 20 Dec., 217. After the death of Pope Victor in 198, Zephyrinus was elected his successor and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> is described by <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> in the "Philosophymena" (IX, xi) as a simple man without <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>. This is evidently to be understood as meaning that Zephyrinus had not taken the higher studies and had devoted himself to the practical administration of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and not to <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> learning. Immediately after his elevation to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>, Zephyrinus called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the confessor Callistus, who lived at Antium and who had received a monthly pension from Pope Victor, and intrusted him with the oversight of the <em>coemeterium.</em> It is evident that shortly before this the Roman <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community had, under Victor, become the owner of a common place of burial on the Via Appia, and Zephyrinus now placed Callistus over this cemetery which was given the name of Callistus. Undoubtedly Callistus was also made a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> by Zephyrinus. He was the confidential counsellor of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, whom he succeeded. The positions of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, which had remained favourable in the first years of the government of Emperor Septimus Severus (193-211), grew constantly worse, and in 202 or 203 the edict of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> appeared which forbade conversion to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> under the severest penalties. Nothing is known as to the execution of the edict in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself nor of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> in this era.

<p>More, however, is certain concerning the internal disputes in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> over the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Trinity. The adherents of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teacher Theodotus the Tanner had been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> with their leader by Pope Victor. They formed an independent <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> community at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> which was ruled by another Theodotus, the Money Changer, and Aselepodotus. These men persuaded a confessor of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> named Natalis, who had acknowledged his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without wavering before the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> judge and had suffered torture, to permit himself to be made the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> for a monthly payment of 170 denarii. Natalis, however, received many warnings in dreams. At first he paid no attention to these visions, but on one occasion he believed that he had been severely tortured by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and now he began to ponder the matter. Early in the morning he put on a penitential garment, covered himself with ashes, and threw himself with tears at the feet of Zephyrinus. He confessed his wrong-doing and begged to be received again into the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which was finally granted him (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250105.htm"><em>Church History</em> V.32</a>). In the same era the adherents of Montanus also worked with great energy at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanist</a> Proculus (or Proclus) published a work in defense of the new prophecies. A refutation of Proclus in the form of a dialogue was written by a learned and rigidly <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Roman <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> named Caius, wherein he refers to the grave of St. Peter on the Vatican Hill and of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> on the <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">Via Ostiensis</a>. Caius rejects the Apocalypse of St. John, which he regards as a work of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> <a href="../cathen/03539a.htm">Cerinthus</a>. In opposition to Caius, <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> wrote his "Capita contra Caium" (cf. Eusebius, <a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.28</a> and <a href="../fathers/250106.htm">VI.20</a>).

<p><a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> was the most important <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> among the Roman <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> of this era. He was an avowed adherent of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Divine Logos. He taught that the Divine Logos became man in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that the Logos differs in every thing from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he is the mediary between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the world of creatures. This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> in the form in which it was set forth by <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> and his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> aroused many <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a>, and another <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> appeared in opposition to it. This latter <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was represented at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in this era by Cleomenes and particularly by Sabellius. These men were rigid opponents of the Theodotians, but were not willing to acknowledge the incarnation of the Logos, and emphasized above all the absolute unity (<em>monarchia</em>) of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. They explained the Incarnation of Christ in the sense that this was another manifestation (<em>modus</em>) of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in His union with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. Consequently they were called Modalists or Patripassians, as according to them it was not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> but the Father Who had been crucified. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> common people held firmly, above all, to the Unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and at the same time to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Originally no distrust of this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was felt among them. Pope Zephyrinus did not interpose authoritatively in the dispute between the two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the Modalists was not at first clearly evident, and the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> offered many difficulties as regards the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Zephyrinus said simply that he acknowledged only one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this was the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, but it was the Son, not the Father, Who had died. This was the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> urged that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should approve of a distinct <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> which represented the Person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as actually different from that of the Father and condemned the opposing views of the <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Monarchians</a> and Patripassians. However, Zephyrinus would not consent to this. The result was that <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> grew constantly more irritated and angry against he <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and particularly against the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Callistus whom, as the councillor of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he made responsible for the position of the latter. When after the death of Zephyrinus Callistus was elected Roman <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a> withdrew from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with his scholars, caused a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and made himself a rival <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.

<p>Zephyrinus was buried in a separate sepulchral chamber over the cemetery of Calistus on the Via Appia (cf. Wilpert, "Die papstgruber und die Suciliengruft in der Katakombe des hl. Kallistus", Freiburg, 1909, 91 sqq.). The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> attributes two Decrees to Zephyrinus; one on the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the other on the Eucharistic Liturgy in the title churches of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The author of the biography has ascribed these Decrees to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> arbitrarily and without historical basis.
