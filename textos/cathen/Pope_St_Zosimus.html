<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope St. Zosimus</h1>  

<p>(Reigned 417-18).

<p>Year of birth unknown; died 27 December, 418. After the death of <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Pope Innocent I</a> on 12 March, 417, Zosimus was <a href="../cathen/11456a.htm">elected</a> his successor.

<p>According to the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> Zosimus was a <a href="../cathen/06735a.htm">Greek</a> and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> name was Abram. Harnack (Sitzungsberichte der Berliner Akademie, 1904, 1050) wished to deduce from this name that the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was of Jewish origin, but the statements of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> in respect to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of this period cannot always be regarded as exact (Duchesne, "Histoire ancienne de l'&eacute;glise", 111, 228, note).

<p>Nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of the life of Zosimus before his elevation to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">papal see</a>. His <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> took place on 18 March, 417. The festival was attended by Patroclus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Arles</a>, who had been raised to that <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in place of Bishop Hero, who had been forcibly and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> removed by the imperial general Constantine. Patroclus gained the confidence of the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at once; as early as 22 March he received a <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letter</a> which conferred upon him the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> over all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gallic</a> provinces of Viennensis and Narbonensis I and II. In addition he was made a kind of <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">papal vicar</a> for the whole of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, no <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gallic</a> ecclesiastic being permitted to journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> without bringing with him a certificate of identity from Patroclus.

<p>In the year 400 <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Arles</a> had been substituted for <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> as the residence of the chief government official of the civil <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Diocese of Gaul</a>, the "Prefectus Praetorio Galliarum". Patroclus, who enjoyed the support of the commander Constantine, used this opportunity to procure for himself the position of supremacy above mentioned, by winning over Zosimus to his <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Vienne, Narbonne, and <a href="../cathen/09715b.htm">Marseilles</a> regarded this elevation of the <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">See of Arles</a> as an infringement of their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, and raised objections which occasioned several <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">letters</a> from Zosimus. The dispute, however, was not settled until the pontificate of <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Pope Leo I</a> (see <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">AIX</a>). Not long after the <a href="../cathen/11456a.htm">election</a> of Zosimus the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> Coelestius, who had been condemned by the preceding <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent I</a>, came to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to justify himself before the new <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, having been expelled from Constantinople. In the summer of 417 Zosimus held a meeting of the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the Basilica of St. Clement before which Coelestius appeared. The propositions drawn up by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Paulinus of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, on account of which Coelestius had been condemned at <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Carthage</a> in 411, were laid before him. Coelestius refused to condemn these propositions, at the same time declaring in general that he accepted the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> expounded in the <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">letters</a> of <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Pope Innocent</a> and making a confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was approved. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was won over by the shrewdly calculated conduct of Coelestius, and said that it was not certain whether the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> had really maintained the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a> rejected by <a href="../cathen/08011a.htm">Innocent</a>, and that therefore he considered the action of the <a href="../cathen/01191a.htm">African</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> against Coelestius too hasty. He wrote at once in this sense to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01191a.htm">African province</a>, and called upon those who had anything to bring against Coelestius to appear at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> within two months. Soon after this Zosimus received from <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> also an artfully expressed confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, together with a new treatise by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> on <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> held a new <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, before which both these writings were read. The skilfully chosen expressions of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> concealed the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> contents; the assembly held the statements to be <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, and Zosimus again wrote to the <a href="../cathen/01191a.htm">African</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> defending <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagius</a> and reproving his accusers, among whom were the <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gallic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Hero and Lazarus. <a href="../cathen/02108d.htm">Archbishop Aurelius of Carthage</a> quickly called a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a>, which sent a <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">letter</a> to Zosimus in which it was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had been deceived by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. In his answer Zosimus declared that he had settled nothing definitely, and wished to settle nothing without consulting the <a href="../cathen/01191a.htm">African</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. After the new synodal <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">letter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">African council</a> of 1 May, 418, to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and after the steps taken by the <a href="../cathen/07460a.htm">Emperor Honorius</a> against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, Zosimus recognized the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> character of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. He now issued his "Tractoria", in which <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> and its authors were condemned. Thus, finally, the occupant of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> at the right moment maintained with all authority the traditional <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and protected the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> against <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.

<p>Shortly after this Zosimus became involved in a dispute with the <a href="../cathen/01191a.htm">African</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in regard to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> of <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appeal</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> who had been condemned by their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/01594a.htm">Apiarius of Sicca</a> had been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> on account of his crimes he <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appealed</a> directly to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, without regard to the regular course of <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appeal</a> in <a href="../cathen/01191a.htm">Africa</a> which was exactly prescribed. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at once accepted the <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appeal</a>, and sent <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> with <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">letters</a> to <a href="../cathen/01191a.htm">Africa</a> to investigate the matter. A wiser course would have been to have first referred <a href="../cathen/01594a.htm">Apiarius</a> to the ordinary course of <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appeal</a> in <a href="../cathen/01191a.htm">Africa</a> itself. Zosimus next made the further mistake of basing his action on a reputed <a href="../cathen/03287a.htm">canon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Council of Nicaea</a>, which was in reality a <a href="../cathen/03287a.htm">canon</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Roman</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> the <a href="../cathen/03287a.htm">canons</a> of <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Sardica</a> followed those of <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Nicaea</a> immediately, without an independent title, while the <a href="../cathen/01191a.htm">African</a> <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> contained only the genuine <a href="../cathen/03287a.htm">canons</a> of <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Nicaea</a>, so that the <a href="../cathen/03287a.htm">canon</a> appealed to by Zosimus was not contained in the <a href="../cathen/01191a.htm">African</a> copies of the <a href="../cathen/11044a.htm">Nicene</a> <a href="../cathen/03287a.htm">canons</a>. Thus a serious disagreement arose over this <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appeal</a>, which continued after the death of Zosimus.

<p>Besides the writings of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> already mentioned, there are extant other <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">letters</a> to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine</a> province in <a href="../cathen/01191a.htm">Africa</a>, in regard to a <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> in respect to <a href="../cathen/12429b.htm">Priscillianism</a> and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the different grades of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> attributes to Zosimus a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> on the wearing of the <a href="../cathen/09601b.htm">maniple</a> by <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and on the <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedication</a> of <a href="../cathen/11515b.htm">Easter candles</a> in the country <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>; also a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> forbidding <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> to visit taverns. Zosimus was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the sepulchral Church of St. Laurence in Agro Verano (cf. <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Bulletino di arch. christ.", 1881, 91 sqq.).
