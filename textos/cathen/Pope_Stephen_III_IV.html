<h1>Pope Stephen (III) IV</h1>  

<p>Born about 720; died 1 or 3 August, 772. <a href="../cathen/11577a.htm">Paul I</a> was not dead when trouble began about the election of his successor. Toto of Nepi with a body of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscans</a> burst into <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and, despite the opposition of the <em>primicerius</em> Christopher, forcibly intruded his brother Constantine, a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, into the chair of Peter (June, 767). In the spring of 768, however, Christopher and his son Sergius contrived to escape from the city, and with the aid of the Lombards deposed the usurper. They were also able to overthrow the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Philip, whom some of their Lombard allies had clandestinely elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. By their efforts Stephen, a <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a>, the son of Olivus, was at length canonically elected and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> (7 August, 768). He had been a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and had been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by Pope Zachary. After his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipopes</a> were treated with the greatest cruelty which, it seems to be generally allowed, Stephen was unable to hinder. To prevent the recurrence of such an election as that of Constantine, the Lateran council forbade <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> to be elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> or to take part in their election for the future. Only <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> were to be chosen <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> (April, 769). Through Stephen's support the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> Leo was enabled to hold the See of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> against a lay intruder, and in turn through the support of the brothers <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and Carloman, Kings of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, Stephen was able to recover some territories from the Lombards. But their king, Desiderius, managed to strike two serious blows at Stephen. He brought about a marriage between his daughter and <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, and in some mysterious manner effected the fall of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> chief <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, Christopher and Sergius. He also allied himself with Paul Afiarta, Stephen's chamberlain, who practised great cruelties when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> lay dying. Desiderius also brought about trouble in Istria by trying to cause a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> against the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Grado, but Stephen defended the patriarch promising him even armed support if <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>. Stephen is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as saint in some Martyrologies.
