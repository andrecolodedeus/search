<h1>Pope Stephen (II) III</h1>  

<p>Unanimously elected in St. Mary Major's and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on 26 March (or 3 April), 752; d. 26 April, 757. He had at once to face the Lombards who were resolved to bring all <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> under their sway. With the capture of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> (751), they had put an end to the power of the Byzantine exarchs and were preparing to seize the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. In vain did Stephen apply for help to Constantinople and freely spent his money to induce them to keep the peace they had made with him, and to refrain from hostilities. He accordingly devoted himself to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and endeavoured to obtain assistance from Pepin and the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>. As a last resource he went himself to Gaul to plead his cause before the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> king. Receiving a most favourable reception, he <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> Pepin as King of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Franks</a>, and at Kiersey was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> assured by him that he would defend him, and would restore the exarchate to St. Peter. Failing to make any impression on <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a>, the Lombard king, by repeated embassies, Pepin forced the passes of the Alps, and compelled him to swear to restore <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and the other cities he had taken (754). But no sooner had Pepin withdrawn from <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> than <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a> roused the whole Lombard nation, appeared in arms before the walls of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Jan., 756), ravaged the neighbourhood, and made a desparate attempt to capture the city. After receiving one appeal for help after another from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, Pepin crossed the Alps a second time (756), and again forced <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a> to submission. This time Stephen was put in possession of the cities of the exarchate and of the Pentapolis, and became practically the first <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>-king. Towards the close of this same year <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a> died amid preparations for once more violating his engagements. On his death two rivals claimed the Lombard throne, Desiderius, Duke of Istria and Ratchis, brother of <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a>, who in 749 had resigned the Lombard crown, and had taken the monastic habit in <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>. Desiderius at once invoked the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and, on condition of his help, promised to restore to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> certain cities in the exarchate and the Pentapolis which still remained in the hands of the Lombards, and to give the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a large sum of money. Stephen at once sent envoys to both the rivals, and, impressing on Ratchis the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of being true to his <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monastic</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, succeeded in bringing about peace, and preventing civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Ratchis returned to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and Desiderius was recognized as king (about March, 757). The latter, however, did not fulfill his promise to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in its entirety. He gave up <a href="../cathen/05751b.htm">Faenza</a>, <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, and two small towns, but retained Bologna, <a href="../cathen/07692a.htm">Imola</a>, and other towns in the Pentapolis till his overthrow by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>. Stephen had scarcely established a system of government in the exarchate when he had to quell the rebellion of Sergius, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, whom he had made its governor. He, however, caused the rebel to be brought to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and kept him there whilst he lived. Stephen corresponded with the <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Emperor Constantine</a> on the subject of the restoration of the sacred images, and himself restored many of the ancient churches of the city. Remarkable for his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, Stephen built <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> for them near St. Peter's, in which church he was buried.
