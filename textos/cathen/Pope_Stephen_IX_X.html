<h1>Pope Stephen (IX) X</h1>  

<p>Born probably about the beginning of the eleventh century; died at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, 29 March, 1058. (Junian?) Frederick, destined to become Pope Stephen X, was the son of Gozelon, Duke of Lower Lorraine and of Junca, the daughter of <a href="../cathen/02487a.htm">Berengarius</a> II, King of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. As he advanced in years he became as distinguished for character and learning as he was for his birth. It was seemingly whilst he was a canon of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> that his cousin <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> met him and made him chancellor and librarian of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> (c. 1051). He accompanied <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> in his apostolic journeyings throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and was sent by him on the famous embassy to Constantinople (1054) which terminated in the final separation of the Eastern and <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Churches</a>. On his return from the East he was robbed by the Count of Teate, and, to avoid falling into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Emperor Henry III</a>, the Black (who seems to have distrusted him as the brother of the rebellious Godfrey the Bearded, Duke of Lorraine), he became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> (1055), and, after the death of the Emperor Henry, its <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> (1057). He was made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal-priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/03742b.htm">St. Chrysogonus</a> by Victor II, and, on the latter's death, he was freely chosen his successor, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> on the following day (3 August, 1057). As <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, he carried on the work of reformation which had been inaugurated by <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">St. Leo IX</a>. To show how much he was in earnest, he at once made <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> of both that <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> champion of reform, <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a>, and the quondam <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Humbert, his own uncompromising companion on the embassy to Constantinople. He also made no little use of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Cardinal Hildebrand</a> (afterwards <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">St. Gregory VII</a>), the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the reforming party. He sent him to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> to effect an improvement in the <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> of its <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> with instructions to proceed to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and to induce the regent, the empress-mother Agnes, to accept his election which had been made without any reference to her. It was further arranged that <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a> was then to go on to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Stephen was preparing to reopen negotiations with the <a href="../cathen/06752a.htm">Greek Church</a>, and to try to stop the advance of the Normans in southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, when he died, exhorting the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> to await the return of <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a> before electing his successor. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the Church of St. Reparata.
