<h1>Pope Sylvester II</h1>  

<p>Reigned 999-1003; also called Gerbert. Born at or near Aurillac, Auvergne, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, about 940-950, of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 12 May, 1003. Gerbert entered the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and received his first training in the Monastery of Aurillac. He was then taken by a Spanish count to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where he studied at Barcelona and also under Arabian teachers at <a href="../cathen/04359b.htm">Cordova</a> and Seville, giving much attention to mathematics and the natural <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, in which he made unusual progress. From <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> he proceeded to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with Bishop Hatto of <a href="../cathen/15405a.htm">Vich</a>, who had been his chief <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> instructor, and <a href="../cathen/08427a.htm">John XIII</a> recommended him to the <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Emperor Otto I</a>, who sent him to <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> Gerannus. There he was soon appointed a teacher in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> by Archbishop Adalbero. He undertook journeys of considerable length, e.g., to <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, where he held a disputation with Ortricus of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a> before <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a>. In 983 <a href="../cathen/11355a.htm">Otto II</a> bestowed on him the abbey of <a href="../cathen/02605b.htm">Bobbio</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was very poor and Gerbert returned to <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. He again taught the most varied branches with great success, devoted himself <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> to study, and helped raise <a href="../cathen/07515c.htm">Hugh Capet</a> to the throne. Adalbero wished Gerbert to be his successor, but when the former died in 988 Arnulph, a natural son of King Lothaire, was raised to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> at the instigation of <a href="../cathen/07515c.htm">Hugh Capet</a>. Arnulph was deposed in 991 by a <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held near <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> for alleged treason against the king, and Gerbert was elected his successor. Although Gerbert soon held a provincial synod to condemn those who had injured the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a>, and these decisions were confirmed at another <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synod</a> held at Chela under the presidency of Robert, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, there was much opposition to Gerbert's elevation to the See of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. Consequently <a href="../cathen/08427c.htm">John XV</a> sent Leo, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Sts. Boniface and Alexius at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. On 2 June, 995, Leo held a synod at Mouson. Gerbert appeared personally to defend himself, but was temporarily suspended from his episcopal office. He sought to show that this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> was unlawful, but a further synod (concilium Causeiense), held on 1 July, 995, at which Gerbert was present, declared Arnulph's deposition and Gerbert's elevation illegal and invalid.

<p>Gerbert now went to the court of the youthful Emperor <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a>, whose teacher he became and whom he accompanied to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> for the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>. As the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a> was not restored to Gerbert, he remained in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and in 998 <a href="../cathen/06790a.htm">Gregory V</a> appointed him <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>. Gerbert attended the Roman synod before which the marital affairs of King Robert of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> were laid. When <a href="../cathen/06790a.htm">Gregory V</a> died on 18 February, 999, Gerbert was elected his successor through the influence of the emperor, and took the name of Sylvester. He was the first <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The new head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> administered his high office with great earnestness and a profound sense of responsibility. His discourse upon the episcopal office shows what his view of the chief spiritual <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was ("Sermo de informatione episocoporum", P.L., CXXXIX, 169 sq.). He took energetic measures against the abuses in the life of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> caused by <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a>, and was anxious that only capable men of spotless lives should receive the episcopal office. His relations with <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> were very friendly, and he supported the emperor's political <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Otto gave the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> eight Italian countships, which formerly had belonged to the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">States of the Church</a>, by a deed of gift the genuineness of which, however, is questioned (Wilmans, "Jahrbucher des deutschen Reiches unten den sachsischen Kaisen", II, pt. II, 233 sq.). At the same time the emperor declared the Donation of Constantine to be a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>. During Otto's residence at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the winter of 1000-1001 Sylvester held a Roman synod on 1 February, 1001, in the presence of the emperor, at which amongst other matters the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Gandersheim were discussed. A revolt at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> directed against the emperor forced Otto and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to flee. Sylvester was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to remain away for several months, during which the city suffered party quarrels. On 27 December he called a second synod at <a href="../cathen/14754a.htm">Todi</a> on account of the difficulties at Gandersheim, and shortly after was present at Otto's death.

<p>Sylvester regulated important <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters in various countries. Soon after his elevation to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> he confirmed anew his former opponent Arnulph as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> which he sent to him gives clear <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that he had now abandoned his earlier position in regard to the authority of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> decisions concerning the disputed see. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> established an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> for <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> at <a href="../cathen/06590b.htm">Gnesen</a>, and one for <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> at <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>. On 27 March, 1000, he granted the title of king to the ruler of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and appointed him <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> vicar for his country. He energetically maintained church discipline in the question of the marriage of the French King Robert, and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> the king to send <a href="../cathen/02519a.htm">Bertha</a> away. Sylvester returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> soon after Otto's death, although the leaders of the different parties of nobles still retained all their power. A little later he died. His epitaph has been preserved. Besides a dogmatic treatise, "De corpore et sanguine Domini", Sylvester wrote a series of works principally on <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a>, mathematical, and physical subjects; they are to be found in P.L., CXXXIX. He was held in high repute for his learning; the common people regarded his as a magician in league with the devil, and many legends grew up around his name. He is said to have introduced the use of Arabic figures into Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and to have invented the pendulum clock.
