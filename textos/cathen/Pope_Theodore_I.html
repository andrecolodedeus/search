<h1>Pope Theodore I</h1>  

<p>Pope from 642 to 649; the date of his birth is unknown. He was a Greek of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> and the son of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Theodore. His election as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was promptly confirmed by the Exarch of <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, perhaps because he was a Greek, and he was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 24 Nov., 642. Engaged throughout all his pontificate in the struggle against <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a>, he at once wrote to the Byzantine Emperor Constans II to inform him that he could not recognize Paul as <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of Constantinople, because the deposition of his predecessor (Pyrrhus) had not been canonical. He then urged Constans to withdraw the Ecthesis. He also wrote to Paul and to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him, to impress upon them the importance of securing the legal deposition of Pyrrhus, if the accession of Paul was to be recognized. If Theodore's vigorous action produced no result at Constantinople, it elsewhere excited strong opposition to <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelitism</a>. The Bishops of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, Palestine, and Africa expressed their loyal submission to his teaching in very striking language. Even the deposed patriarch Pyrrhus recanted his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> before Theodore (645), but soon relapsed into his old <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (648). Meanwhile, urged by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Africa, Theodore made another effort to reclaim Paul, but only succeeded in drawing from him an express declaration of his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of one Will in our Lord. This brought upon him sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and deposition from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (649). To this Paul replied by barbarously ill-treating the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <em>apocrisiarii</em> (or <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncios</a>) at Constantinople. He also prevailed upon Constans to issue a new <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> known as the Type <em>(Typus)</em>. This document ordered the <em>Ecthesis</em> to be taken down, and enjoined that in future there was to be no more discussion on the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of one or two Wills or Operations. The Type was promptly condemned "by the whole West" in general, and specifically by Theodore's successor (<a href="../cathen/09723c.htm">St. Martin I</a>), but it is not certain whether Theodore lived long enough to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> it. This energetic pontiff, who was good to the poor of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and a benefactor of its <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, was buried in St. Peter's, 14 May, 649.
