<h1>Pope Urban III</h1>  

<p>Reigned 1185-87, born at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>; died at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, 19 October, 1187. Uberto, of the noble <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the Crivelli, was created <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by Lucius III in 1182 and <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> in 1185. On 25 November of this year Lucius died at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was elected to succeed him on the same day; he was <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> on 1 December. This haste was probably due to fear of imperial interference. Urban inherited from his predecessor a legacy of feud with the great <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Emperor Frederick Barbarossa</a>, and this was embittered by personal enmity, for at the sack of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> in 1162 the emperor had caused several of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> relatives to be proscribed or mutilated. It has been noticed that the breach between Lucius III and Frederick coincided with the arrival in Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> (August, 1185) of Constance, the heiress of the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Kingdom of Sicily</a>, who was <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to Frederick's son Henry. The marriage, which was celebrated at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> on 4 Jan., 1186, six weeks after Urban's accession, "constituted for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> the gravest check it had suffered for a long time. By it was ruined the whole political edifice so laboriously raised by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of the eleventh and twelfth centuries to keep in check the power of the Emperors in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and to assure the independence of the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>" (Chalandon, II, 390). By this marriage was lost that Norman support on which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a> had so long relied in its contest with the empire. Nor was this the only cause of quarrel. The treaty of 1177 had left unsettled the question of the succession to the estates of Matilda of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, while Frederick had seized the revenues of vacant German <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and suppressed <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">nunneries</a> for the sake of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>.

<p>Urban maintained the refusal of Lucius III to crown Henry, and the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a> was induced by the emperor to perform the office, although it belonged to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in right of the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> which he had retained, possibly to that end, after his election. Urban replied by <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicating</a> the patriarch and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had assisted at the <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>. On 31 May he promoted to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a> the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a> Folmar, and next day <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> him as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, contrary to a promise he had made to the emperor, for though Folmar had been canonically elected, Frederick had granted investiture to Rudolf, the candidate of the minority. The emperor closed the passes of the Alps against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> messengers to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and sent Henry to ravage the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>. Urban had hoped for support from the German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but at the Diet of Gelnhausen (April or May, 1187), from which the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, Philip von Heinsberg, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, was excluded, Frederick won the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to his side and caused them to send letters to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> urging him "to do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to the Emperor in those things which were justly demanded of him" (Arnold of L&uuml;beck, III, 18). Urban replied by summoning the emperor to appear before his tribunal at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, and was only prevented from pronouncing <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> against him by the Veronese, who, as Frederick's subjects, would not permit the sentence to be <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in their city. Urban set out for <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, where he would have been able to carry out his threat, but died at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, after a pontificate of a year and eleven months. His death is ascribed by <a href="../cathen/02472a.htm">Benedict of Peterborough</a> to grief at the news of the utter defeat of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a> at the battle of Hattin, and it is commonly stated that it was caused by the news of the fall of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, but <a href="../cathen/15634c.htm">William of Newburgh</a> assures us that the report of the disaster of Hattin (3-4 July) did not reach the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> till after the election of <a href="../cathen/06795a.htm">Gregory VIII</a>, so it is hardly probable that Urban III ever heard of the surrender of the Holy City which took place on 2 October.

<p>A curious story is told by Peter of <a href="../cathen/02602b.htm">Blois</a>, <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Bath, who claims to have been intimate with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ("in scholis Urbani socius et descipulus fueram Maldyebyrig") and connects his death with his wrath against Baldwin, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>. At the very beginning of his pontificate Urban had granted the request made to his predecessor by Henry II of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and appointed Baldwin <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">Apostolic legate</a> in the Province of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, but in the latter's quarrel with the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had taken the part of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> obdurate. Perhaps this was not the only cause of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; for Baldwin, moved probably by jealousy, had persuaded the king to conduct back to Normandy the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> sent to crown John as King of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> (<a href="../cathen/02472a.htm">Benedict of Peterborough</a>, "Gesta regis Henrici Secundi"). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> even sent a gold crown ("coronam auro contextam") for this purpose. He exerted himself to bring about peace between <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and on 23 June, 1187, his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a> by threats of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> prevented a pitched battle between the armies of the rival kings near Ch&acirc;teauroux, and brought about a two years' truce. Urban's letters show <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the Holy Land and a desire to promote peace among the quarrelling <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> potentates of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. Unfortunately, it cannot be ascertained whether the interesting letter addressed to Philip of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> (Jaff&eacute;, "Regesta", 15,924) really belongs to this <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The number of privileges in favour of the Knights <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> is remarkable. The letters and privileges of Urban III are given in P.L., CCII. His <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a>, "a handsome sarcophagus resting on four columns" (Gregorovius), may still be seen in <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>.
