<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Pope Urban IV</h1>  

<p>Reigned 1261-64 (Jacques Pantal&eacute;on), son of a French cobbler, born at <a href="../cathen/15067a.htm">Troyes</a>, probably in the last years of the twelfth century; died at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, 2 Oct., 1264. He became a canon of Laon and later <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, attracted the attention of <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> at the Council of Lyons (1245), and in 1247 was sent on a mission to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. There his chief work was the restoration of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> in <a href="../cathen/13790b.htm">Silesia</a> and the reconciliation of the <a href="../cathen/14541b.htm">Teutonic Knights</a> with their <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> vassals. He became <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">Archdeacon</a> of Laon two years later, and in 1251 was sent into north <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> with the commission to obtain recruits for the cause of William of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> candidate for the empire. He was made <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15350c.htm">Verdun</a> in 1253 and <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in 1255, at a time of great difficulty and distress for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the Holy Land. On the death of <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> (25 May, 1261) he had returned to the west and was at <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>. After a three months' <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a>, protracted by the jealousies of the eight <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> who composed the whole <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> was elected on 29 August, 1261. <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a>, the feeblest and most pacific of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> who were engaged in the struggle with the imperial house of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, had left two heavy tasks for his successor to accomplish: the wresting of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> from the Hohenstaufen and the restoration in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> of the influence which the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> had lost through his indecision. The Latin Empire of Constantinople came to an end with the capture of the city by the Greeks a fortnight before Urban's election, and for a while he intended a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> for its re-establishment; but he felt that the tasks near home had the first claim on him. In 1268 Conradin, the last of the Hohenstaufen, died on the scaffold at <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>; it was Urban IV's action in calling Charles of Anjou into the field against Manfred that brought this about. "The fact", says Ranke, "that Urban IV contrived this combination, places him among the important <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>."

<p>His experience of affairs and his personal character fitted him for his work. He had had an excellent <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> and was active, capable, self-reliant, and always ready for any work that presented itself. His life was a full one, yet business had not banished <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. "The Pope does what he will", reports a <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienese</a> ambassador, "there has been no Pope since <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> so energetic in word and deed . . .There is no obstacle to his will . . .he does everything by himself without taking advice" (Pflug-Harttung, "Iter Italicum", 675). Had his reign been longer, he would have been one of the most striking figures in the history of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. Urban's great antagonist was Manfred, son of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, and usurper of the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> crown. Manfred's chief gift was tact; as an administrator he had his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> highly centralized system to rely on, but as a warrior he was lacking in decision and boldness. After the battle of Montaperti, he became the hero of half <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the centre of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> party and of all opposition to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. He was anxious for peace and recognition from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and Urban was able to keep him in play until the long drawn-out negotiations with Charles of Anjou were nearly complete. Within less than a year of his election the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> created fourteen new <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>. Of these six were relatives or dependents of the eight who had elected him, but seven were <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a>, including his own nephew and three who had been St. Louis's counsellors. Thus Urban was sure of a majority in the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#x">Sacred College</a>, but he brought into being a French party which was a principal factor in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> policy for the rest of the thirteenth century and in the fourteenth century became practically the whole College. Among the new <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> were the three future <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/09724a.htm">Martin IV</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07459a.htm">Honorius IV</a>, who were to have the greatest share in finishing and defending his work.

<p>Urban's first step towards the restoration of his power in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was to put the finances in order and pay his predecessor's <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a>. He changed the bankers of the Apostolic Camera, employing a <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienese</a> firm whose services did much to assure the ultimate success of his plans. Urban's Italian policy gives a complete picture of his statesmanship--astute and diplomatic on occasions, but with a marked predilection for energetic measures. He aroused dissensions between rival <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibelline</a> cities and, by an adroit use of the then generally acknowledged right of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> to declare null all <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> towards <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicate</a>, was able to throw their commercial affairs into confusion (for some curious details see Jordan, "Origines", 337 sq.). He established an ascendancy over his partisans and raised up a new <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> party bound to him by personal interest, which eventually furnished Charles of Anjou with monetary support without which his expedition must have failed. In the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a> new officers were appointed, important points fortified, and the defensive system of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> restored. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Urban obtained the recognition of his sovereignty, but he never risked a visit to the city. In <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a> his most important act was the strengthening of the traditional alliance between the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> and the House of Este. By the middle of 1263 the general results of Urban's extra-Sicilian Italian policy were seen in the almost complete restoration of order in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>, the weakening of Manfred's alliances in <a href="../cathen/09336b.htm">Lombardy</a>, and the resurrection in <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> of the crushed <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelphs</a>.

<p>A foreign conqueror for <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to attain the expulsion of Manfred, for after the defeat of <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV's</a> forces at <a href="../cathen/06123b.htm">Foggia</a> (20 Aug., 1255) all hope was lost of a direct conquest by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. In 1252 <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> had granted the crown of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> to the English Henry III for his second son, Edmund; but the king had his hands too full at home and was himself too prodigal to allow him to embark on the very costly <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> adventure. Charles of Anjou, though he had refused the offer of <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a>, had both the power and the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for such an undertaking. St. Louis's scruples as to the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of Conradin and Edmund were overcome, and though he refused the crown for himself or his sons, he finally permitted its offer to his brother. In the mind of the holy king the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> expedition appeared as a preliminary to a great <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>: he saw that <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> would, in the hands of a French prince, be an ideal starting-point. Yet Louis had been desirous of peace between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and Manfred, and even the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for a time seemed prepared to recognize him as King of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, but the negotiations finally failed. Urban made it his business to prove that the fault lay with his opponent, for <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> opinion was interested in a struggle in which great princes such as Alphonsus of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> and Baldwin, the exiled Latin Emperor of Constantinople, had intervened on the side of peace. It was about May, 1263, that St. Louis made up his mind, and shortly afterwards the envoy of Charles of Anjou appeared in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The chief conditions laid down by Urban were as follows: <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> must never be united to the empire, its king must pay an annual tribute, take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of fealty to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and abstain from acquiring any considerable dominion in Northern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; the succession also was strictly regulated. The treaty in fact "was to be the last link in the long chain of acts which had established the suzerainty of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> over <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>" (Jordan, 443).

<p>The negotiations dragged on slowly as long as the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> felt no acute need of French intervention in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, but by May, 1264, the fortunes of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were threatening to decline quickly, in face of the rising activity and fortunes of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibellines</a>. Urban sent the French Cardinal Simon de Brion to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> as his <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> with power to concede certain disputed points: he was, however, to insist on a guarantee that Charles would not retain in perpetuity the Senatorship of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> to go on a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> to the Holy Land were to be commuted for the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against Manfred and his <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, which was to be preached throughout <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Urban's position was daily growing more dangerous in spite of the incomprehensible inactivity of Manfred. He feared a simultaneous attack from north and south, and even attempts to assassinate himself and Charles of Anjou by the emissaries of Manfred's reputed ally, the "Old Man of the Mountains". In August St. Louis's last objections to the treaty were overcome, and various concessions made to Charles's demands. The <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> held several <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> to obtain from the French <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> granted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for the expedition. In <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> fortune continued to favour the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibellines</a>; a <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> army was defeated in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Patrimony</a>, and Lucca deserted to the enemy. <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienese</a> intrigue threatened Urban's security at <a href="../cathen/11331c.htm">Orvieto</a>, and on 9 Sept. he set out for <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>, where he died.

<p>"Thus the man, whose bold initiative was to influence so greatly the destinies of three great countries, to bring to a close the most glorious period of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> by the ruin of the Hohenstaufen, to introduce a new dynasty into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and to direct French policy in a direction as yet unknown, quitted the stage before he had seen the consequences of his acts at the very hour when the negotiations, commenced at his accession and continued throughout his reign, had reached completion" (Jordan, op. cit., 513).

<p>If Urban's treatment of Manfred appear harsh and unscrupulous, it must be remembered how the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had suffered at the hands of the Hohenstaufen ever since the days of Frederick I. In the eyes of <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> law Manfred was a usurper without <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>: he had callously seized his nephew Conradin's crown, and even that nephew could not inherit from a grandfather who had been deprived of his fief for rebellion against his suzerain. At this period, too, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Government, owing in part to its very weakness, stood for municipal freedom, while the Hohenstaufen had in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> substituted for the aristocratic <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudalism</a> a bureaucratic despotism supported by the arms of their devoted <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>.

<p>Two other points in Urban's policy must be noted: his dealings with the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantine Empire</a> and with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. Manfred's designs on the territories of Palaeologus, together with the exiled Baldwin's secret attempt to reconcile Manfred with St. Louis, made the Greek emperor, politically, at least, the natural ally for a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> fearful of an increase in the power of the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> king. Urban sought an understanding with Michael Palaeologus, and here too gave a lasting direction to <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> policy, setting it on the path which led to the union (inoperative though it was) of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> in 1274. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> Urban's collectors of money were exceedingly busy; like St. Louis, he supported Henry III against the barons. He absolved the king from his promise to observe the Provisions of Oxford, declared <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> taken against him to be unlawful, and condemned the rising of the barons. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>. The Feast of Corpus Christi was instituted by Urban IV.
