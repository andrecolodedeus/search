<h1>Pope Urban VII</h1>  

<p>Giambattista Castagna, born at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 4 Aug., 1521; elected <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, 15 September, 1590; died at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 27 September, 1590. His father, Cosimo, was a <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoese</a> nobleman; his mother, Costanza Ricci, was a Roman and sister of Cardinal Jacovazzi. He studied civil and canon law at various <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and graduated as doctor of both <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> at Bologna. Soon after he became auditor of his uncle, Cardinal Girolamo Verallo, whom he accompanied as datary on a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> legation to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. On his return to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a> made him referendary of the Segnatura di Giustizia and on 1 March, 1553, appointed him <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13203a.htm">Rossano</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 30 March, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by Cardinal Verallo, 4 April. <a href="../cathen/08564a.htm">Julius III</a> sent him as governor to Fano in 1555, and under <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a> he was for a short time Governor of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> and Umbria. During the reign of <a href="../cathen/12129a.htm">Pius IV</a> he settled satisfactorily a long-standing boundary dispute between the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/10704a.htm">Terni</a> and <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>. From 1562 to 1563 he assisted at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, where he was made president of various congregations and manifested great <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and learning. In 1565 he accompained the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>-legate Buoncompagni (afterwards <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a>) to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where he remained seven years as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> at the Court of Philip II. On his return to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> he <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> resigned the archiepiscopal <a href="../cathen/13203a.htm">See of Rossano</a> in January, 1573, and was sent by <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> as <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, whence he was transferred as governor to Bologna in 1577. A year later he was sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> extraordinary to <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, to represent <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> at the peace conference between Philip II and the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">United Provinces</a>. Upon his return to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he was appointed Consultor of the Holy Office and the Ecclesiastical State. On 12 December, 1583, <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> created him <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">cardinal priest</a> with the titular Church of S. Marcello, and on 8 October, 1584, appointed him <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of Bologna. During the reign of <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> (1585-90) he was highly influential. On 19 November, 1586, he became Inquisitor-General of the Holy Office.

<p><a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> having died 27 August, 1590, the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, 54 in number, entered the <a href="../cathen/04192a.htm">conclave</a> at the Vatican on 7 September, and elected Cardinal Castagna as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> on 15 September. The news of his election was a cause of universal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. The new pontiff was not only highly esteemed for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and learning, he had also, in the many important and difficult positions which he filled as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, manifested extraordinary <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and administrative ability. He chose the name <em>Urban</em> in order that this name, which in Latin signifies "kind", might be a continuous reminder to him to show kindness towards all his subjects. One of his first acts was to have a list made of all the poor in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> that he might alleviate their needs. He also gave liberal <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to those <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> whose income was insufficient, paid the <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debts</a> of all the <em>monts-de-pi&eacute;t&eacute;</em> in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Ecclesiastical State</a>, and ordered the bakers of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to make larger loaves of bread and sell them cheaper, indemnifying their losses out of his own purse. Desirous of checking the luxury of the rich, he forbade his chamberlains to wear silk garments. In order to give occupation to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, he ordered the completion of the public works that had been commenced by his predecessor. He appointed a committee of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, consisting of <a href="../cathen/11419a.htm">Paleotti</a>, Fachinetti, Lancelotti, and Aldobrandini, for the reform of the Apostolic Datary. Strongly opposed to nepotism, he expressed his purpose never to appoint any of his relatives to an office in the <a href="../cathen/13147a.htm">Curia</a> and forbade them to make use of the title "Excellence", which it was customary to give the nearest relatives of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. A few days after his election he became seriously ill. The faithful united in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for his recovery; public processions, expositions of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> exercises were conducted. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> confessed and communicated every day of his illness. He once expressed a desire to remove to the Quirinal, where the air was purer and more wholesome, but, when told that it was not customary for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to be seen in the city before his <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a>, he remained in the Vatican. He died before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> could take place and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/13369b.htm">Vatican Basilica</a>. On 22 September, 1606, his remains were transferred to the Church of S. Maria sopra Minerva, where a magnificent monument was erected in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. His temporal possessions, consisting of 30,000 <em>scudi</em>, he bequeathed to the Archconfraternity of the Annunciation to be used as dowries for poor girls.
