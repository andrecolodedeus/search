<h1>Pope Victor II</h1>  

<p>(GEBHARD, COUNT OF CALW, TOLLENSTEIN, AND HIRSCHBERG.)

<p>Born about 1018; died at <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a>, 28 July, 1057. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> catalogues make him a native of the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Nordgau, while most German sources designate Swabia as his birthplace. His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were Count Hartwig and Countess Baliza; the <a href="../cathen/07228a.htm">Emperor Henry III</a> recognized him as a collateral kinsman, and he was a nephew of Bishop <a href="../cathen/06402a.htm">Gebhard III</a> of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, who at the court Diet of Goslar presented him (Christmas Day, 1042) to Henry III as a candidate for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> of <a href="../cathen/05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a>. The emperor hesitated at first because Gebhard was only twenty-four years old, but, on the advice of the aged Archbishop Bardo of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, he finally consented to invest him with this important see. Gebhard proved to be a good <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and a prudent statesman. He was in the emperor's retinue when the latter was crowned at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1046; he took part in the synod presided over by <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a> in October, 1049, and in the consultations between the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the emperor at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> and Bamberg in 1052. By this time he had become the most influential councillor of Henry III. It was upon his advice that in 1053 a German army, which was on its way to join <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> in his <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the Normans, was recalled, an advice which he is said to have regretted when he was <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (Leo Marsicanus in his "Chronaicon Casinense", II, 89, in P.L., CLXXIII, 692). Early in the same year he became regent of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> for the three year old Henry IV. In this capacity he had occasion to prove his loyalty towards the emperor by defending the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the empire against the deposed Duke Conrad, the counts of Scheyern, and his own uncle, Bishop Gebhard of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>.

<p>After the death of <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> (19 April, 1054) <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Cardinal-subdeacon Hildebrand</a> came to the emperor at the head of a Roman legation with the urgent request to designate Gebhard as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. At the Diet of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, in September, 1054, the emperor granted this request, but Gebhard refused to accept the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> dignity. At a court Diet held at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> in March, 1055, he finally accepted the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, but only on condition that the emperor restored to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> all the possessions that had been taken from it. The emperor consented to this condition and Gebhard accompanied <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he was formally elected and solemnly <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> on Maundy Thrusday, 13 April, 1055, taking the name of Victor II. Even as <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> he retained the Diocese of Eichst&auml;tt. Victor II was a worthy successor of <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a>. With untiring <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he combated, like his predecessor, against <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a>. Being well supported by the emperor, he often succeeded where <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a> had failed. On Pentecost Sunday, June 4, 1055, he held a large synod at <a href="../cathen/06105c.htm">Florence</a>, in presence of the emperor and 120 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, where former decrees against simony and incontinence were confirmed and several offending <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> deposed. To King Ferdinand of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> he sent messengers with threats of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> if he should continue in his refusal to acknowledge Henry III as Roman Emperor. Ferdinand submitted to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> demands. Before the emperor returned to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> he transferred to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the duchies of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a> and <a href="../cathen/03216c.htm">Camerino</a>. Early in 1056 Victor II sent <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Hildebrand</a> back to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to resume his labours against <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> and <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a>, which he had begun under <a href="../cathen/09160c.htm">Leo IX</a>. He appointed the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> Raimbaud of Arles and Pontius of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legates</a> to battle against the same vices in Southern <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Late in the summer of the same year he accepted the urgent invitation of the emperor to come to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, arriving at Goslar on 8 September. He accompanied Henry III to Botfeld in the Hartz Mountains where on 5 October he witnessed the untimely death of the emperor. Before his death, the emperor entrusted his six-year-old successor, Henry IV, and the regency of the kingdom to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. On 28 October, after burying the emperor in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, he secured the imperial succession of Henry IV by having him solemnly <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>. He still further strengthened the position of the boy-king by recommending him to the loyalty of the princes at the imperial Diet which he convened at Cologne early in December, and at the court Diet of <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a> on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>.

<p>Leaving the regency of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in the hands of Agnes mother of Henry IV, Victor returned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in February, 1057, where he presided over a council at the Lateran on 18 April. On 14 June he created Frederick, whom he had a month previously helped to the abbacy of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm#p">Cardinal-priest</a> of San Crisogono thus gaining the friendship of the powerful Duke Godfrey of Lorraine, a brother of the new <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. He then went to <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a>, where he settled (23 July) a jurisdictional dispute between the palace of St. Donatus near Arezzo; five days later he died. His attendance wished to bring his remains to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at <a href="../cathen/05364a.htm">Eichst&auml;tt</a> for burial. On their way thither, the remains were forcibly taken from them by some citizens fo Ravena and buried there in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> Rotonda, the burial place of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric the Great</a>.
