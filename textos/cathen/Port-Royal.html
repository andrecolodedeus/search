<h1>Port-Royal</h1>  

<p>A celebrated <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> which profoundly influenced the religious and literary life of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> during the seventeenth century. It was founded in 1204 by Mathilde de Garlande, wife of Mathieu de Montmorency, in the valley of Chevreuse, six leagues [between sixteen and seventeen miles] from <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where the village of Maguy-les-Hamaux, in Seine-et-Oise, now stands. Subject first to the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> and then to that of C&#238;teau, it suffered greatly during the English invasions and the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of religion. At the beginning of the seventeenth century its discipline was completely relaxed, but in 1608 it was reformed by M&#232;re Ang&eacute;lique Arnauld, aided by the advice and encouragement of <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a>. Nuns trained at Port-Royal then spread all over <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, working for the reform of the other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. In 1626 Port-Royal, besides being very unhealthful, no longer afforded adequate accommodation, and the community migrated to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, settling in the Faubourg St-Jacques. Renouncing the ancient privileges granted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, the new <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> placed itself under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; the <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, devoted henceforth to the worship of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>, took the name of Daughters of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. In 1636 the <a href="../cathen/05218a.htm">Abb&eacute; de St-Cyran</a> became the <a href="../cathen/05024a.htm">spiritual director</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, which he soon made a hotbed of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. He gathered around him the Abb&eacute; Singlin, the two brothers of M&#232;re Ang&eacute;lique, Arnauld d'Andilly and Antoine, the great Arnauld, their three nephews, Antoine* Lema&#238;tre, Lema&#238;tre de Lacy, and Lema&#238;tre de S&eacute;ricourt, Nicole, Lancelot, Hamon, <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Le Nain de Tillemont</a>, and others, who, urged by a desire for solitude and study, withdrew to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> "of the fields".&mdash;There was then a Port-Royal of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and a Port-Royal "of the fields".&mdash;In 1638 they opened what they called the <em>petite &eacute;coles,</em> in which Lancelot, Nicole, Guyot, and M. de Selles taught the nephews of <a href="../cathen/05218a.htm">St-Cyran</a> and some other children. They were transferred to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> in 1647, then brought back to the country to Les Granges, near Port-Royal, to Trous, at the home of M. de Bagnols, to Le Chesnay, at the residence of M. de Buni&#232;res.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> dispute was then being vigorously waged. In 1639 <a href="../cathen/05218a.htm">St-Cyran</a> had been arrested by <a href="../cathen/13047a.htm">Richelieu's</a> order and cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, from which he was not set free till 1643, dying a little later. In 1640 the "Augustinus" of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a> had appeared, and in 1643 Arnauld's work, "La fr&eacute;quente communion", which gave rise to violent discussions. Port-Royal was then the heart and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the opposition. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> there were as stubborn as the men, and all the partisans of the new teaching in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> and in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> turned towards the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for light and support. Solitaries and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> flocked thither. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, in its turn, became too small to contain their numbers, and a multitude settled once more in the country. Unfortunately, in 1653 and 1656, five propositions extracted from the "Augustinus", which, though not found in it verbatim, were, according to <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, "the soul of the book", were condemned by the <a href="../cathen/14149a.htm">Sorbonne</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and two <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bulls</a>. From that time began the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Port-Royal which the pleading of Arnauld, the famous distinction of fact and law, and the "Provinciales" of <a href="../cathen/11511a.htm">Pascal</a> only increased. Port-Royal, having refused to subscribe to the formulary drawn up by the <a href="../cathen/01795a.htm">Assembly of the Clergy</a> in 1657, all the <em>petites &eacute;coles</em> were successively closed, the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> were driven out from the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and the confessors expelled. But in vain; the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, even the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, <a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a> de P&eacute;r&eacute;fixe, endeavoured by their learning and their patience to bring the recalcitrants to reason. "They are as pure as angels", said the latter, "but proud as <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>." Only a few consented to sign; the more obstinate were finally sent to the country or dispersed in different communities. In 1666 the director, Lema&#238;tre de Lacy, was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in the Bastille.

<p>At length, after interminable negotiations, in 1669, what was called "The Peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>" was signed; Port-Royal became again for some years an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and religious centre, shining on all that was most intelligent and noble in the city and at the Court. But the fire was smouldering beneath the ashes. In 1670 Arnauld was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to fly to the Low Countries, and <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a>, who had begun to suspect and hate the stubborn Port-Royal community, resolved to subdue them. In 1702 the quarrel broke out anew on the condemnation by the Sorbonne of a celebrated "case of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>". In 1704 Port-Royal des Champs (Port-Royal of the Fields) was suppressed by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/04028a.htm">Clement IX</a>. In 1709 the last twenty-five <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> were expelled by the public authorities. Finally, in 1710, to blot out all traces of the centre of revolt, the buildings of Port-Royal were razed, the site of the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> turned into a marsh, and even the ashes of the dead were dispersed. Port-Royal was destroyed, but its spirit lived on, especially in the Parliament and the University, and during almost all the eighteenth century <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> was distracted by the ever-recurring struggle between its heirs and its adversaries. (See <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">J<font size=-2>ANSENIUS AND</font> J<font size=-2>ANSENISM</font></a>.)

<p>By the rigour of its <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">moral</a> code, which carried the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ideal to extremes, by the intense effort which it demanded of the human will, by the example with which it illustrated its teaching, by the writings which it issued or inspired &mdash; <a href="../cathen/05218a.htm">St-Cyran's</a> and M&#232; Ang&eacute;lique's "Lettres spirituelles", Arnauld's "Fr&eacute;quente communion", <a href="../cathen/14724b.htm">Le Nain de Tillemont's</a> "Histoire eccl&eacute;siastique", <a href="../cathen/11511a.htm">Pascal's</a> "Provinciales" and "Pens&eacute;es"; the "Logique"&mdash;Port-Royal produced a great impression on the seventeenth century. Almost all the great writers felt its influence. Two were its direct product: <a href="../cathen/12630b.htm">Racine</a>, its pupil, and <a href="../cathen/11511a.htm">Pascal</a>, its most distinguished champion. The others were more or less indebted to it. <a href="../cathen/02623a.htm">Boileau</a> remained till the end united in heart and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with it (cf. "Ep&#238;tre sur l'amour de Dieu"). Mme de S&eacute;vign&eacute; was passionately fond of Nicole's "Essais". La Rochefoucauld's pessimism is closely related to theirs, as is that of the gentler LaBruy&#232;re; St-Simon is devoted to them, and <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> himself is not altogether a stranger to their influence.

<p>What contributed most to the power of their "Messieurs" was the <em>petites &eacute;coles</em> and their pedagogy. Their <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> principle was: that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> itself, is not an end, but a means; it should serve only to open and develop the mind, and raise it above the matter of teaching. In teaching they adopted an openly <a href="../cathen/04744b.htm">Cartesian</a> and <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> method; they strove to cultivate the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and the reasoning faculty much more than the memory, and they appealed constantly to personal reflection. Breaking with the traditions of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the University, who taught in Latin, they taught in French. The child learned the alphabet in French, and was instructed in the mother tongue before studying the dead languages. He wrote in French before writing in Latin. He had to compose short dialogues, stories, letters, the subject of which he chose from among the things he had read. Translation, and especially verbal translation, took precedence over written themes. Finally, Greek, of which they were unrivalled teachers, received more attention and a more important place. Even in matters of discipline they introduced reforms: they endeavoured to combine severity with gentleness. Punishment was reduced to a minimum, and the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was likened to the home as far as possible. They suppressed in the pupil the desire to surpass a fellow-pupil, and developed in him only that natural attraction of the interest presented by the subjects. These admirable teachers and educationists have left us several <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> books of the highest merit, some of which have remained classics for nearly two centuries&mdash;the "Grammaire", edited by Lancelot, but in reality the work of Arnauld; the "Logique" of Arnauld and Nicole; the "Jardin des racines greques" of Lancelot; the "M&eacute;thodes" for learning Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, etc. Not everything in their books or in their system of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> is worthy of admiration, but it is incontestable that they contributed to the progress of pedagogy against the older <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> methods.
