<h1>Porter</h1>  

<p>(Also called DOORKEEPER. From <em>ostiarius</em>, Latin <em>ostium</em>, a door.)

<p><em>Porter</em> denoted among the Romans the slave whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it was to guard the entrance of the house. In the Roman period all houses of the better class had an <em>ostiarius</em>, or ostiary, whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> were considered very inferior. When, from the end of the second century the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities began to own houses for holding church services and for purposes of administration, church ostiaries are soon mentioned, at least for the larger cities. They are first referred to in the letter of <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Pope Cornelius</a> to Bishop Fabius of Antioch written in 251 (<a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, <a href="../fathers/250106.htm"><em>Church History</em> VI.43</a>), where it is said that there were then at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 46 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 7 <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, 7 <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, 42 <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>, and 52 <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcists</a>, <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a>, and ostiaries, or doorkeepers. According to the statement, of the <a href="../cathen/09224a.htm">"Liber Pontificalis"</a> (ed. Duchesne, I, 155) an ostiary named Romanus suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in 258 at the same time as <a href="../cathen/09089a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>. In Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> the office of the ostiary was the lowest grade of the minor <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. In a law of 377 of the Codex Theodosianus (Lib. XVI, tit. II, num. XXIV; ed. Gothofredi, VI, I, 57) intended for the Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, the ostiaries are also mentioned among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who have a <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to personal immunity. In his letter of 11 March, 494, to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> Pope Gelasius says that for admission into the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> it was <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> that the candidate could read (must, therefore, have a certain amount of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>), for without this prerequisite an applicant could, at the most, only fill the office of an ostiary (P.L., LVI, 691). In <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> itself this office attained to no particular development, as a large part of these <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, namely the actual work <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> in the church building, what is now probably the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13748a.htm">sexton</a>, was at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> performed by the <em>mansionarii</em>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the three lower grades (<a href="../cathen/10332b.htm">minor orders</a>) were united at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> into the <em>Schola cantorum</em> and as such took part in the church ceremonies. There are no special <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> or ceremonies for the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of the lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> in the oldest <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/06357a.htm">Gallican Rite</a>, short statements concerning the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of the lower orders, among them that of the ostiaries, are found in the "Statuta ecclesi&aelig; antiqua" a collection of canons which appeared at Arles about the beginning of the sixth century (<a href="../cathen/09479a.htm">Maassen</a>, "Quellen des Kirchenrechts", I, 382). The "Sacramentarium Gelasianum" and the "Missale Francorum" contain the same rite with the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> used on this occasion.

<p>According to these the ostiaries are first instructed in their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>; after this he brings them before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who takes the keys of the church from the altar and hands them to the candidate for <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> with the words: "Fulfil thine office to show that thou knowest that thou wilt give account to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> concerning the things that are locked away under these keys." Then follows a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the candidate and a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the occasion that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> pronounces over him. This <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> was also at a later date adopted by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> in its liturgy and has continued with slight changes in the formul&aelig; until now. In Latin Western <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, outside of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in the late Roman era and the one following, the ostiaries were still actually employed as guardians of the church buildings and of their contents. This is shown by the epitaph of one Ursatius, an ostiary of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> (Corpus inscr. latin., XIII, 3789). An ostiary of the church of <a href="../cathen/14207a.htm">Salona</a> is also mentioned in an epitaph (Corpus inscr. Iatin., III, 13142). Later, however, in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Latin Church</a> the office of ostiary universally remained only one of the degrees of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> and the actual work of the ostiary was transferred to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, (sacristans, <a href="../cathen/13748a.htm">sextons</a>, etc.). In the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of ostiaries at the present day their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> are thus enumerated in the Pontifical: "Percutere cymbalum et campanam, aperire ecclesiam et sacrarium, et librum ei aperire qui pr&aelig;dicat" (to ring the bell, to open the church and <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, to open the book for the preacher). The forms of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> are similar to those in the old <a href="../cathen/06357a.htm">Gallican Rite</a>. In the East there were also doorkeepers in the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. They are enumerated as <a href="../cathen/11727a.htm">ecclesiastical persons</a> by the Council of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> (343-81). Like the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> and <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcists</a>, they were only appointed to serve the church, but received no actual <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> and were not regarded as belonging to the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical hierarchy</a>. According to the "Apostolic Constitutions" belonging to the end of the fourth century the guarding of the door of the church during the service was the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>. Thus the doorkeepers exercised their office only when service was not being held.
