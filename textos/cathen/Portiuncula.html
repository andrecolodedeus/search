<h1>Portiuncula</h1>  

<p>(PORZIONCULA or PORZIUNCOLA).

<p>A town and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> situated about three-quarters of a mile from <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>. The town, numbering about 2000 inhabitants and officially known as Santa Maria degli Angeli, has grown up around the church (basilica) of Our Lady of the Angels and the adjoining <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. It was here that on 24 Feb., 1208, <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a> recognized his vocation; here was for the most part his permanent abode, after the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> (of the Cluny Congregation from about 1200) had presented him (about 1211) with the little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> Portiuncula, i.e. a little portion (of land); here also he died on Saturday, 3 October, 1226. According to a legend, the existence of which can be traced back with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> only to 1645, the little <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Portiuncula was erected under <a href="../cathen/09217a.htm">Pope Liberius</a> (352-66) by <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> from the Valley of Josaphat, who had brought thither <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14774a.htm">grave of the Blessed Virgin</a>. The same legend relates that the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> passed into the possession of St. Benedict in 516. It was known as Our Lady of the Valley of Josaphat or of the Angels &#151; the latter title referring, according to some, to <a href="../cathen/02006b.htm">Our Lady's ascent into heaven</a> accompanied by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> (Assumption B.M.V.); a better founded opinion attributes the name to the singing of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> which had been frequently heard there. However this may be, here or in this neighbourhood was the cradle of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, and on his death-bed St. Francis recommended the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> to the faithful protection and care of his brethren. Concerning the form and plan of the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> built near the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> we have no information, nor is the exact form of the loggia or platforms built round the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> itself, or of the choir for the brothers built behind it, known. Shortly after 1290, the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, which measured only about twenty-two feet by thirteen and a half, became entirely inadequate to accommodate the throngs of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>. The altar piece, an Annunciation, was <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Hilarius of <a href="../cathen/15487a.htm">Viterbo</a>, in 1393. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was at most the residence, only for a short time, of the ministers-general of the order after St. Francis. In 1415 it first became associated with the Regular Observance, in the care of which it remains to the present day. The buildings, which had been gradually added to, around the shrine were taken down by order of <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">Pius V</a> (1566-72), except the cell in which St. Francis had died, and were replaced by a large basilica in contemporary style. The new edifice was erected over the cell just mentioned and over the Portiuncula <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, which is situated immediately under the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a>. The basilica, which has three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> and a circle of <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> extending along the entire length of the <a href="../cathen/01237c.htm">aisles</a>, was completed (1569-78) according to the plans of Jacob Barozzi, named <a href="../cathen/15428a.htm">Vignola</a> (1507-73), assisted by <a href="../cathen/01284a.htm">Alessi Galeazzo</a> (1512-72). The Doric order was chosen. The basilica forms a Latin cross 416 feet long by 210 feet wide; above the middle of the <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transept</a> rises the magnificent <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a>, flanked by a single side-tower, the second never having been finished. In the night of 15 March, 1832, the arch of the three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> and of the choir fell in, in consequence of an earthquake, but the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> escaped with a big crack. <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a> had all restored (1836-40), and on 8 Sept., 1840, the basilica was reconsecrated by <a href="../cathen/08760b.htm">Cardinal Lambruschini</a>. By <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 11 April, 1909, <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> raised it to a "patriarchal basilica and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>". The <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> was therefore immediately rebuilt at the expense of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> province of the Holy Cross (also known as the Saxon province), and a <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> throne added. The new altar was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Cardinal De Lai on 7 Dec., 1910. Under the bay of the choir, resting against the columns of the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a>, is still preserved the cell in which St. Francis died, while, a little behind the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, is the spot where the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a>, during a temptation, is said to have rolled in a briar-bush, which was then changed into thornless roses. During this same night the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> received the Portiuncula <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a>. The representation of the reception of this <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> on the <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> of the Portiuncula <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>, the work of <a href="../cathen/11362a.htm">Fr. Overbeck</a> (1829), enjoys great celebrity.

<p>The Portiuncula <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> could at first be gained only in the Portiuncula <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> between the afternoon of 1 Aug. and sunset on 2 Aug. On 5 Aug., 1480 (or 1481), <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> extended it to all churches of the first and second orders of St. Francis for <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>; on 4 July, 1622, this privilege was further extended by <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory XV</a> to all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, who, after confession and the reception of <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, visited such churches on the appointed day. On 12 Oct., 1622, <a href="../cathen/07004b.htm">Gregory</a> granted the same privilege to all the churches of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>; <a href="../cathen/15218b.htm">Urban VIII</a> granted it for all churches of the regular <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> on 13 Jan., 1643, and <a href="../cathen/04028b.htm">Clement X</a> for all churches of the <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a> on 3 Oct., 1670. Later <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> extended the privilege to all churches pertaining in any way to the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, even to churches in which the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> held its meetings (even <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> churches, etc.), provided that there was no <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> church in the district, and that such a church was distant over an Italian mile (1000 paces, about 1640 yards). Some districts and countries have been granted special privileges. On 9 July, 1910, <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> (only, however, for that year) granted the privilege that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> could appoint any public churches whatsoever for the gaining of the Portiuncula <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a>, whether on 2 Aug. or the Sunday following (Acta Apostolicae Sedis, II, 1910, 443 sq.; Acta Ord. Frat. Min., XXIX, 1910, 226). This privilege has been renewed for an indefinite time by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the S. Cong. of Indul., 26 March, 1911 (Acta Apostolicae Sedis, III, 1911, 233-4). The <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> is <em>toties-quoties</em>, that is, it may be gained as often as one wishes (i.e. visits the church); it is also applicable to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>.

<p>While the declarations of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> have rendered the Portiuncula <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> certain and indisputable from the juridico-canonistic standpoint, its historical authenticity (sc. origin from St. Francis) is still a subject of dispute. The controversy arises from the fact that none of the old legends of St. Francis mentions the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a>, and no contemporary document or mention of it has down to us. The oldest document dealing with the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> is a notary's deed of 31 October, 1277, in which Blessed Benedict of <a href="../cathen/01702b.htm">Arezzo</a>, whom St. Francis himself received into the order, testifies that he had been informed by Brother Masseo, a companion of St. Francis, of the granting of the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> by <a href="../cathen/07457a.htm">Honorius III</a> at <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a>. Then follow other testimonies, for example, those of Jacob Cappoli concerning <a href="../cathen/09173a.htm">Brother Leo</a>, of Fr. Oddo of Aquasparta, Peter Zalfani, Peter John Olivi (d. 1298, who wrote a scholastic tract in defence of this <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> about 1279), Blessed John of Laverna (Fermo; d. 1322), Ubertinus of <a href="../cathen/03396a.htm">Casale</a> (d. after 1335), <a href="../cathen/06230a.htm">Blessed Francis of Fabriano</a> (d. 1322), whose testimony goes back to the year 1268, etc. In addition to these rather curt and concise testimonies there are others which relate all details in connection with the granting of the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a>, and were reproduced in numberless books: e.g. the testimony of Michael Bernardi, the letters of Bishop Theobald of <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> (1296-1329) and of his successor Conrad Andreae (1329-37). All the testimonies were collected by Fr. Francesco Bartholi della Rossa in a special work, "Tractatus de Indulgentia S. Mariaede Portiuncula" (ed. Sabatier, Paris, 1900). In his edition of this work, Sabatier defends the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a>, although in his world-famous "Vie de S. Fran&ccedil;ois" (Paris, 1894), he had denied its historicity (412 sqq.); he explains the silence of St. Francis and his companions and biographers as due to reasons of discretion etc. Others seek to accord more weight to the later testimonies by accentuating their connection with the first generation of the order; others again find allusions to the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> in the old legends of St. Francis. On the other hand, the opponents regard the gap between 1216 and 1277 as unbridgeable, and hold that the grounds brought forward by the defenders to explain this silence had vanished long before the latter <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. No new documents have been found recently in favour of the authenticity of the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a>.

<p>[Note: The norms and grants of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> were completely reformed by Pope Paul VI after the Second <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> in his <a href="../cathen/01636a.htm">Apostolic Constitution</a> "Indulgentiarum Doctrina" (1967), and the Portiuncula <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> was again confirmed at that time. According to the Enchiridion Indulgentiarum, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> faithful may gain a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> on 2 August (the Portiuncula) or on such other day as designated by the local ordinary for the advantage of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, under the usual conditions (sacramental Confession, <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the intentions of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Supreme Pontiff</a>), by devoutly visiting the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, and there reciting at least the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's Prayer</a> and the Creed. The <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgence</a> applies to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and to the co-cathedral church (if there is one), even if they are not <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a>, and also to quasi-parochial churches. To gain this, as any plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, the faithful must be free from any attachment to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Where this entire detachment is wanting, the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is partial.]
