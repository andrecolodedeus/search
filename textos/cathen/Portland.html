<h1>Portland</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">State of Maine</a>; suffragan of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>; established by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, 8 Dec., 1854. When erected it included the territorial limits of the present States of Maine and <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>. Previous to that time it was under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> and later of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>. In 1884 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was divided, <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a> being made a separate diocese and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> located at <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>. The present Diocese of Portland includes all the <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">State of Maine</a>. It has an area of 29,895 square miles, and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of 125,000, or one-sixth of the total population. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> is organized in the form of a corporation sole, the title of which is "Roman <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Portland".
<h2>Early history</h2>

<p>The earliest attempts at <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colonization in the north or east of what is known as the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> took place in Southern Maine. In 1604, sixteen years before the Pilgrims landed at <a href="../cathen/12171b.htm">Plymouth</a>, Henry IV, King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, gave authority to Pierre du Gaust, Sieur de Monts, to establish colonies between the 40th and 46th degrees of north latitude. He landed at Cape La Heve, on the southern part of the Nova Scotian coast, and after making several expeditions to the north in the vicinity of the St. Lawrence, sailed south and discovered and named the River St. John, thence south to an island which he named Ste-Croix, or Holy Cross, and now called De Monts Island. The Ste-Croix River derived its name from this island, and today flows by the easternmost part of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. A colony was established on this island, and in their <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in July, 1604, Holy Mass was offered for the first time in New England by the Rev. Nicholas Aubray of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. The hardships of the severe winter were such that seventy-nine of the colonists died before the opening of spring. From Ste-Croix Island on 12 September, 1605, <a href="../cathen/03567a.htm">Champlain</a> set out on a voyage of discovery. He sailed west along the coast as far as the Penobscot River, which he ascended to the mouth of the Kenduskeag Stream, the present site of Bangor. The falls, a mile above, prevented further progress. Descending the Penobscot River, <a href="../cathen/03567a.htm">Champlain</a> sailed west to the mouth of the Kennebec and then returned to the Island of Holy Cross. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> Holy Mass was offered up on this voyage. This was the first foothold of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in the North. Potrincourt who succeeded De Mont, after receiving a blessing on his labours from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, applied himself to the work of colonization and Christianizing the natives. Two <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Fathers <a href="../cathen/02541d.htm">Peter Biard</a> and Enemond Mass&eacute;, who were sent to him after some work among the <a href="../cathen/10283b.htm">Micmacs</a> of Nova Scotia, came to <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>, and began their very successful labours among the Abenaki. In a vessel under the command of La Saussaye, having on board also Fathers Quentin and Lalemant, and the <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brother</a> Du Thet, who had lately come from <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, they sailed to the west and came to Mt. Desert Island, where they landed, and having erected a cross, set up an altar, and, after offering the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, founded a settlement which they called St. Sauveur, or Holy Redeemer. This settlement was destroyed by Argall, who came from <a href="../cathen/15451a.htm">Virginia</a>. The Fathers were taken <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a>, and after many hardships were finally returned to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Brother Du Thet was killed and buried on this island.

<p>Some <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> were afterwards stationed along the coast in the French posts, and had a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Castine, and some settlements along the Kennebec. In 1646, <a href="../cathen/05164a.htm">Father Gabriel Druillettes</a> was sent to the Kennebec and established the mission of the Assumption among the Abenaki, obtaining wonderful results from this docile people. In 1652, he returned to <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, but in 1656 and 1657, came again and continued his work. Rev. Laurent Molin, a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a>, laboured at Pentagoet. In 1667, Father Morain was successful with the Penobscots and Passamaquoddy Indians. In 1667, Father Thury, a <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priest</a>, came to the Penobscots and laboured successfully among them to the close of his life. In 1668, he established the mission at Panawaniski, at Oldtown. He was succeeded by Fathers Gaudin and Rageot, who remained among the Penobscots until 1703. In 1668, Father Bigot erected a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at Narantsouac, now Norridgewock, restoring the mission. The <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, Fathers Joseph de la Chasse, Julian Binneteau, <a href="../cathen/02066d.htm">Joseph Aubery</a>, <a href="../cathen/12635b.htm">Sebastian Rasle</a>, Sebastian Lauvergat and Loyard, laboured in turn. Of these <a href="../cathen/12635b.htm">Father Rasle</a> is the best known. He came to Norridgewock in 1695. There he founded a <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and had the Indians instructed. In 1705, the English destroyed the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and village. They were rebuilt in 1722, were once more destroyed, and <a href="../cathen/12635b.htm">Father Rasle's</a> treasures were carried off, including his dictionary of the Abenaki language, now in Harvard College. <a href="../cathen/12635b.htm">Father Rasle</a> was <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> and scalped on 23 August, 1724, and his scalp carried to <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>. His body was buried on the spot where the altar had stood. Father James de Sirenne restored the mission at Norridgewock in 1730. For a long period during the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> the Indians were without missionaries, yet they remained faithful. Numbers of the Abenaki fought for the Colonies during the War of Independence. After the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, when Bishop Carroll was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, the Indians sent a deputation to him for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Father Ciquard, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of St. Sulpice, was sent in answer to this appeal and remained for ten years, until 1794. In 1797, the Rev. John <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a>, then a missionary at <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, came to visit the Indians and remained three months, and while <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, visited them every year until 1804, built them a church and gave them Father Romagne as their <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a>. The latter devoted himself for twenty years to the Penobscots and Passamaquoddys and to the scattered <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> missions. Bishop Fenwick was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in 1825, and continued the work. Father Ffrench, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, was stationed at Eastport, and from that place visited the Indian missions. In July, 1827, Bishop Fenwick visited them and at intervals later. In 1833, 109 years after the destruction of the mission at Norridgewock, Bishop Fenwick erected a monument to the memory of <a href="../cathen/12635b.htm">Father Rasle</a>. Father Demilier continued the work until his death 23 July, 1843. Bishop Fitzpatrick, the successor to Bishop Fenwick, gave over the Abenaki mission to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, and, in 1848, <a href="../cathen/02258a.htm">Father John Bapst</a> was sent to Oldtown and became a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> missionary to both whites and Indians. The Indians of Maine are, as a result of the careful teaching and self-sacrificing labours of the missionaries, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.



<p>In the latter part of the eighteenth century, some immigrants from <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> came to Maine and settled in the towns of Newcastle, Damariscotta, and Nobleboro. Seven <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> had settled at Damariscotta Bridge, and for them Father <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> said <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> in the barn of Matthew Cottrill. Later Mr. James Kavanaugh, a merchant of the town, had fitted up a neat <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> and <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> was celebrated there on the visitations of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In 1800, Mr. Kavanaugh and his partner, Mr. Cottrill, subscribed $1000 each for the new church, which was dedicated 17 July, 1808, Father <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> officiating. This was the second <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> church in New England, and the first built by English-speaking <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a>. In 1822, Bishop <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> came to Portland at the request of some <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and said the first Mass in Portland. Bishop Fenwick succeeded Bishop <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> and ruled the New England province from 1825 to 1845. The work of Bishop <a href="../cathen/03650a.htm">Cheverus</a> among the Indians was continued by Bishop Fenwick, and he established in July, 1834, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colony at Benedicta in Northern Maine and today all the inhabitants of the township are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In 1853 the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> divided the <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Diocese of Boston</a> and erected a new see at Portland, and named its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/02191a.htm">David William Bacon</a>.

<p>James Augustine Healy, second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/09507a.htm">M&acirc;con</a>, Ga., 6 April, 1830. He entered Holy Cross College, 1844, and graduated, 1849. His <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was received at the Grand Seminary, <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, where he spent three years, then two years at St-Sulpice, <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of Notre Dame, Paris, by <a href="../cathen/13769a.htm">Archbishop Sibour</a>, 10 June, 1854. He began his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> labours in <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a> as Secretary to Bishop Fitzpatrick, and became the first chancellor of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. In March, 1866, he was named <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> of St. James' Church by Bishop Williams. A <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> bull <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 12 Feb., 1875, designated him as second <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Portland. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of the Immaculate Conception, Portland, 2 June, 1875. When he assumed the cares of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> he found the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> well established in the cities of <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">Maine</a> and <a href="../cathen/10785a.htm">New Hampshire</a>. In the small towns, however, little was known of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>. Bishop Healy established many missions and new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> name became known in all parts of the state. He introduced the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marists</a> and some <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and was instrumental in establishing the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> and Healy Asylum in Lewiston. In February, 1877, the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> begun in Portland by <a href="../cathen/02191a.htm">Bishop Bacon</a> was completed at a cost of $23,0000. It is named the Kavanaugh School in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Miss Kavanaugh, a sister of Governor Edward Kavanaugh. In 1881, Bishop Healy purchased a splendid estate in Deering, then a separate town, but now a part of Portland, and opened a boarding <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for girls, under the care of the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>. It is known as St. Joseph's Academy, and has an enrollment of about 100 pupils. He also caused to be built on the same grounds a home for aged <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and a neat <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> to serve the needs of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the vicinity. In 1887, St. Elizabeth's Orphan Asylum, which had been transferred to North Whitefield, shortly after his accession, was re-established in Portland. The Sacred Heart School for boys was established by him in 1893. Bishop Healy died 5 August, 1900, respected and beloved by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and people, as a scholar, a master of oratory, and a man of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>.

<p>The third <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Portland was William Henry O'Connell (see <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">B<font size=-2>OSTON</font></a>).

<p>Louis Sebastian Walsh, fourth <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, b. at <a href="../cathen/13396a.htm">Salem</a>, <a href="../cathen/10024c.htm">Massachusetts</a>, 22 Jan., 1858, son of Patrick Walsh and Honora Foley. He was <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> at the Grand Seminary, <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, and St-Sulpice Seminary, Paris, and later made profounder studies of canon law and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> in St. John Lateran, <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, 23 Dec., 1882, by Cardinal La Valletta, he was appointed assistant <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastor</a> at St. Joseph's Church, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>, and professor and director at St. Joseph's Seminary, Brighton, at its opening in 1884, where for thirteen years he taught <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, canon law, and liturgy. In Sept., 1897, he was appointed supervisor of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> in the archdiocese. He was one of the founders of the "New England Catholic Historical Society", also of the "Catholic Educational Association". He was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Portland in Aug., 1906, and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Portland on 18 Oct., 1906, by Rt. Rev. Matthew Harkins of Providence. New <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were soon established, and the mother-house of the Diocesan <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> was erected in the Deering district of Portland. Bishop Walsh opened in Sept., 1909, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Institute in the former mother-house of the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, wherein are taught 200 boys, also the Holy Innocents Home for Infants and St. Anthony's Guild for Working Girls. At Damariscotta in Aug., 1908, a celebration was arranged to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of the dedication of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church, and on this occasion was formed the "Maine <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Historical Society". At Norridgewock the monument erected by Bishop Fenwick to the memory of <a href="../cathen/12635b.htm">Father Rasle, S.J.</a>, was replaced and re-dedicated. On Mt. Desert Island in the town of Bar Harbor the arrival of the first missionaries, in 1604, was commemorated; and a beautiful church dedicated under the name given to the island by them, that of St-Sauveur or Holy Redeemer, was erected. The charities of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> have been arranged on a permanent basis. In general it may be said that there is a splendid advance in all that pertains to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>Within the limits of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, comprising the <a href="../cathen/09541b.htm">State of Maine</a>, there are (1911) 125,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. They are cared for by 125 seculars and 22 <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. There are 70 churches with resident <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and 49 mission churches, 36 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> and 67 stations. There is one college, St. Mary's, Van Buren, conducted by the <a href="../cathen/09750b.htm">Marist Fathers</a>. Nine academies have an enrollment of 500 pupils. St. Joseph's Academy of Maine, conducted by the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, is the largest and best, and furnishes instruction to 100 pupils. There are two <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for Indians caring for 132 pupils; three <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and one home for aged <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> under <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> care number 415. Total of young people under <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> care, 12,274.
