<h1>Portugal</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Geography and physical characteristics</h2>

<p>Portugal is situated on the west of the Iberian Peninsula, being bounded on the north and east by <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and on the west and south by the Atlantic Ocean. It lies between latitudes 37 and 42 north, and longitudes 6 1/4 and 9 1/2 west of Greenwich. The form is approximately rectangular, with a maximum length of 362 miles, a maximum breadth of 140 miles, and an area of 35,490 square miles. For purposes of administration it is officially divided into districts, but the old division into provinces (which originated in the differences of soil, climate, and character of the population) has not lost its meaning and is still employed in common parlance. The names of these provinces are Entre-Douro-e-Minho, Traz-os-Montes, Beira, Estremadura, Alemtejo, and Algarve. The island groups of Madeira with Porto Santo and the <a href="../cathen/02168a.htm">Azores</a> are considered as part of Continental Portugal, the other possessions being colonies. Excluding these islands, Portugal has a sea-board of nearly 500 miles and a land frontier of about 620 miles, the greater part of which is marked by rivers or mountains. But though only a small portion of this frontier is conventional, Portugal and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> are not separated by a strongly marked natural boundary such as divides some countries; indeed they are geographically one.

<p>As regards the nature of the soil, Portugal may be roughly divided into three zones: (1) the northern, which is mountainous and rises from 1800 to 5000 feet, including the Serra do Gerez, notable for its vegetation and thermal springs; (2) the central, a zone of extensive plains divided by mountain ranges, among the latter being the Serra da Estrella (6540 feet), the highest and largest in the country; (3) the southern, the most extensive of the three, almost entirely composed of low-lying plains and plateaus of small altitude. In all these regions the mountains are usually prolongations of Spanish systems. The only independent range of importance is the Serra de Monchique. Briefly, in the north, Portugal has many chains of mountains, plateaus of considerable height, and deep narrow valleys; in the centre, together with high and extensive mountains, we find broad valleys and large plains. Lastly, south of the Tagus, the country is one of plains throughout the Alemtejo, but in the Algarve it again becomes hilly, though the altitudes are rarely considerable. The chief rivers are: (a) the Minho, which forms the northern frontier; (b) the Douro, which rises in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and enters the sea near <a href="../cathen/11260a.htm">Oporto</a>, about one-third of its course being in Portugal; (c) the Mondego, the largest river rising in Portugal, which enters the sea at Figueira after a course of 140 miles; (d) the Tagus, which rises in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, forms above <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> a gulf more than eight miles wide, and enters the sea below that city, after a total course of nearly 500 miles, about one-third in Portugal; (e) the Sado, which flows out in a large estuary at Setubal; (f) the Guadiana, which serves in part as frontier between the two countries. The Tagus is navigable for small vessels as far as Santarem; the Guadiana, as far as Mertola. There are no lakes worthy of mention, the ria at Aveiro connecting with the sea.

<p>Portugal has few good natural harbours. That of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> is the best, and indeed one of the largest in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, and is of easy access at all times. The bar of the Douro is shallow and difficult; a fine artificial port has therefore been built at Leix&otilde;es to serve Oporto. Setubal is a fair harbour, as is Villa Real de S. Antonio, in the Algarve, while Lagos Bay, in the same province, affords a secure anchorage for a numerous fleet. The other ports are only suitable for small craft and are continually being blocked by sand. Portugal is rich in metalliferous deposits, including antimony, copper, manganese, uranium, lead, tin and iron. Coal is scarce and of poor quality. The country has more than a hundred mineral springs, of which the most important are Gerez and Vizella (Minho), Vidago, Pedras Salgadas, and Moledo (Traz-os-Montes), S. Pedro do Sul and Felgueira (Beira Alta), Caldas da Rainha (Estremadura), Moura (Alemtejo), and Monchique (Algarve). A branch of Gulf Stream runs down the West Coast and the climate is temperate, but it differs from province to province according to soil, distance from the sea, etc.; while equable on the coasts, it is subject to sudden changes inland. The plateaux of Traz-os-Montes and Beira are cold and harsh, while the Algarve littoral is hot, but even where the temperature is most extreme, the thermometer rarely rises to 3 Fahrenheit or descends to 2 below freezing. Snow only falls in winter in the high mountains and in north. The rainfall is more abundant in the north. The rainfall is more abundant in the winter than the South, and on the littoral than inland. The humidity produces fogs which render the coasts dangerous to shipping. The most usual winds are north-west, north, and north-east, but in winter south-west winds prevail, accompanied by storms. The <em>nortada</em> and the east wind are dry and disagreeable. Generally speaking, the climate is healthy, the mean temperature being 61 Fahrenheit. In the eighteenth century <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> was much recommended by English physicians as a health resort, and Mont' Estoril, on the sea outside the estuary of Tagus, is now increasing in favour as a winter residence.

<p>The vegetation is rich, including nearly all the vegetable species of temperate climates and a large number of those found in hot countries. Among trees the pine is the most characteristic, but it does not grow south of the Sado. The <em>pinhal</em> of Leiria planted by King Denis is the largest forest and the <em>mato</em> of Busaco is famous for the size and variety of its trees. Fruit trees abound, especially on the Upper Douro, and in Beira. Olives and oranges are everywhere, the Algarve produces figs, and Traz-os-Montes almonds. The vine is universal and forms Portugal's principal wealth. The chief wines are port, which comes from the Douro region, and the wines of Beira and the Peninsula of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> (Collares and Carcavellos), but the largest vineyard is found just south of the Tagus and is a recent creation. The cereals most grown are wheat, maize (Indian corn), and rye, but Portugal still has to depend on foreign countries for a portion of its bread supply. Wine, oil, fruit, vegetables, cattle, and cork are exported in large quantities, and the chief manufactures are cotton wool, gold and silver work, lace, and pottery. The fisheries are the main occupation of the coast population, and the sardine industry at Setubal is a flourishing one.
<h2 id="section2">History</h2>

<p>The lifework of Alfonso Henriques first King of Portugal (1128-85) consisted in his assertion, by fighting and diplomacy, of the political independence of the country, and in his enlargement of its boundaries by conquests from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> who occupied more than half the present kingdom when he began to rule. Though he had assumed the government in 1128, it was only after a period of fifteen years, during which he suffered a series of reverses, that he was able to obtain recognition of his kingship from Alfonso VII of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, to which kingdom the territory of Portugal had formerly belonged. Alfonso Henriques early resolved to protect himself against the claims of his powerful neighbour and overlord, and in 1142 he offered his kingdom to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, declared himself the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> vassal, and promised, for himself and his successors, to pay an annual <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> tribute of four ounces of gold. Lucius II ratified the agreement, taking Portugal under his protection and recognizing its independence, and in 1179 another <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a>, confirmed Alfonso Henriques in his royal dignity. The later now gave up all <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of extending his dominions, beyond the Minho and the Douro, which rivers formed its boundaries to the north and the east, and endeavoured to increase them to the south. He carried on a persistent <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> against the infidel by sudden incursions into <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> territory and by midnight assaults on <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> towns, and on the whole he was successful. In 1147 he took the almost impregnable city of Santarem. In the same year, after a four months' siege, the great city of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, containing "154,000 men, besides <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children", fell to his arms assisted by a Northern fleet of 164 ships which was on its way to the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm#section2">Second Crusade</a>. The king thereupon moved his capital to the Tagus, appointed Gilbert, an Englishman, its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, transported the body of St. Vincent to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and perpetuated the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> memory in the arms he gave to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, viz., a ship and two crows, in allusion to the manner in which the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> were transported from Cape St. Vincent and to the birds which were said to have accompanied them during the whole journey.



<p>The reduction of the neighbouring strongholds followed, but the king had to wait for the arrival of another <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusading</a> fleet before he could take Alcacer do Sol, in 1158. The cities of <a href="../cathen/05670a.htm">Evora</a> and Beja fell into his hands soon afterwards, but he could not hold so extensive a territory, and the country south of the Tagus was retaken more than once. At the end of his life an unwarrantable attack on <a href="../cathen/02193a.htm">Badajoz</a> placed him in the power of King Ferdinand of <a href="../cathen/09175a.htm">Leon</a>, and his last years were full of defeats and humiliations. Nevertheless, when he died the independence of Portugal had been secured, its area doubled, and the name of the little realm was famous throughout <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> for its persistent struggle against the enemies of the Cross. A rough warrior, an astute politician, and a loose liver, Alfonso Henriques was yet a man of strong <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He corresponded with <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> and put his country under the protection of the Blessed Virgin, decreeing that an annual tribute should be paid to the abbey of Clairvaux. For the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a>, to whose <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> he attributed the capture of Santarem, he founded the great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Alcoba&ccedil;a, the most famous in Portugal, and endowed it handsomely, so that its lands stretched to the ocean and contained thirteen towns in which the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> exercised authority and levied taxes. They corresponded to such generosity by reducing that great territory to cultivation, and Allocable became the mother of numerous daughter <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, while its <a href="../cathen/03637a.htm">chartulary</a> served in early times as that of the kingdom. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Allocable had the post of chief almoner and sat in the Royal Council and the Cortes with the honours of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Furthermore, Alfonso Henriques, in 1132, established for the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a> the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Santa Cruz at <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, which rivalled Allocable in its wealth and social mission, and for the same order he built S. Vicente in <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, which is now the residence of the Patriarch.

<p>Sancho I (1185-1211) continued the work of reconquest and a large part of the Algarve fell into his hands, but a fresh invading wave of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> from <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> ultimately pushed the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> frontier back to the Tagus. In the intervals of peace allowed him, the king was active in building towns and settling his territory, thus deserving his name of "The Peopler", and, being a thrifty man, he amassed a large treasure. On his accession, he asked and obtained the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation of his title, which protected him against his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> neighbours, and after some delay paid the tribute to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. This was continued by his immediate successors, but afterwards fell into abeyance. Sancho imitated his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> liberality to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and gave further endowments to <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>; he likewise favoured the military Orders of the Temple of <a href="../cathen/07476a.htm">Hospitallers</a> of Aviz, and of S. Thiago, which, besides their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> works, supplied the best disciplined soldiers for the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a> and garrisoned the frontier towns and castles. But he was a man of irascible temperament, and his <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> led him to keep a "wise <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>" in his company whom he used to consult on his enterprises. His disputes with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the violent measures he dealt out to them are explained partly by his character and partly by the influence of his chancellor Julian, who had studied <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman Law</a> at Bologna and aimed at increasing the royal authority. Sancho intervened in a question between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11260a.htm">Oporto</a> and the citizens and ignored the <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> with which <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> punished his high-handed proceedings. He also came in conflict with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, whom he <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> and treated with great cruelty.

<p>Sancho persisted in invading the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and in particular refused to recognize the <a href="../cathen/06153b.htm">ecclesiastical forum</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunity</a> from military service. Though he made some concessions before his death, the conflict he had opened lasted through the next two reigns, and for nearly a century the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the Crown were involved in a struggle over the limits of their respective powers. All the early kings were wont to reward services by extensive grants of lands, and in these lands they gave up royal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. In time, so large a part of the country was held in <a href="../cathen/10579a.htm">mortmain</a>, or had passed into the hands of the nobles, that the rest did not produce enough revenue to meet the increasing expenses of government. The monarchs then tried to overcome the difficulty by a <a href="../cathen/13007a.htm">revocation</a> of grants, which naturally met with resistance from the nobility and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Denis, though so generally favourable to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, employed a more equitable remedy by prohibiting, in 1286, the purchase of real estate by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, but this and a stricter <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of 1291 were found too severe and had to be modified. The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was a great and growing one and, had there been no other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of discord, would have sufficed to set the Crown and landowning classes at issue. Alfonso II (1211-23) took care to obtain the confirmation of his title from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, and at the Cortes of Coimbra he sanctioned the concessions made by his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whose help he hoped to have when he came to annul the large bequests of land which Sancho had made to his children. In this he was disappointed, for the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> intervened as arbiter, and Alfonso's sisters got their <a href="../cathen/09115a.htm">legacies</a>, but they and they all took the veil, and his brothers never obtained the estates which had been left to them.

<p>This was a victory for the king, who now, on the advice of his chancellor, sent a commission of enquiry through the kingdom to ascertain the titles to land and either confirm or revoke them, as seemed to him just. So far he had kept on good terms with the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but Alfonso's determination to increase the power of the Crown and fill his treasury affected their <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a>, and his action in a dispute between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> and his <a href="../cathen/04659a.htm">dean</a> showed that the king's attitude towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had changed. By 1221 the old differences had appeared again, and in an acute form: Alfonso had seized <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">church property</a>, compelled <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> to plead before secular justices and to serve in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. The learned and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> convoked an assembly of <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> in which he accused the king of his breaches of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> life. The latter met this by confiscating the goods of the <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, who fled to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Honorius dispatched three <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to remonstrate with Alfonso, and, as this had no effect, they <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him a year later. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> then threatened to <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> the king's subjects from their allegiance and hand over the realm to any prince who cared to take it. A further <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a>, in 1222, insisting on <a href="../cathen/12775a.htm">reparation</a>, together with an attack of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> induced Alfonso to enter into negotiations of peace, and these were in progress when he died.

<p>The reign of this <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> king witnessed a religious revival which was rendered <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> by the general laxity of both <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> were introduced by the king's sister and, although they soon won the affection of the people, they were received with little cordiality on the part of the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> and the other orders, who saw their pecuniary interest damaged. In a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> (1233) the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> complains of the hostility shown to the <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. At Oporto the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> ordered them out of the city, sacked their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, and burned it, but the citizens sided with them, and in the end they were able to return. The order soon spread over the country, <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> were built for them, members of the royal family chose their churches as <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">burial</a> places, and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> bestowed <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> on <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a> and charged them with delicate missions. It was the <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> for testators to leave a part of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and Bishop Sueiro of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> a statute that one-third should be so bequeathed under pain of refusal of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and canonical burial. The citizens <a href="../cathen/01652a.htm">appealed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> against this <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and Honorius condemned it, and charged the superiors of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> to see that the practice was discontinued. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> had entered Portugal between 1217 and 1222, and, by virtue of their austere <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, poverty, and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, they obtained a welcome second only to that given the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>. Sancho II (1223-48) was still only a boy when he succeeded his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>. His <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> bound him to make satisfaction for the material losses inflicted on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by Alfonso II, and to punish the guilty parties. They also promised that <a href="../cathen/12437a.htm">ecclesiastical privileges</a> should be respected, but those responsible for the outrages of the last reign remained in power, and the king had small control over them.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> showed as little desire for peace as the nobles, and vied with them in vexing the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> by their monetary exactions. With each succeeding year a state of <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a> increased over the kingdom. The bellicose <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11260a.htm">Oporto</a>, Martinho Rodrigues, presented to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a long list of accusations against the monarch, in reply to which Cardinal John de Abavila was dispatched to Portugal on a reforming mission, but though he did much good he was unable to end the discords. Bishop Sueiro then put himself at the head of the malcontents and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> in dark colours the condition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were blackmailed and deprived of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, the king and the nobles despised <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> censures, public offices were given to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and so on. <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Pope Gregory</a> thereupon sent a commission to require the king to correct abuses under threat of penalties, but at first there were some difficulties in the way of reform. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> too often abused their <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a>, they admitted men to orders who were only anxious to evade military service, and sometimes to avoid answering to the secular courts for their crimes. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> remedied these evils, but the Government failed to repress those which were charged against it. Yet the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> was averse to extreme measures, because it appreciated Sancho's <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusading</a> energy &mdash; for, though a bad man and an indolent administrator, he was a bold soldier. An ancient dispute between <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and citizens as to the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the City of <a href="../cathen/11260a.htm">Oporto</a> revived again, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and king were soon at issue. Furthermore, the latter roused strong opposition by refusing to allow <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> bodies or <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> to accept gifts of land, or to purchase it, and, not content with robbing and profaning churches, he slew some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. He brought matters to a climax when he intervened in a disputed succession to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishopric</a> of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> and used the most brutal methods to enforce his will and <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, who had previously threatened, now confirmed a sentence of <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a>.

<p>Sancho gave way for the moment, and peace was made, the king turning his arms against the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>, but in an interval between his successful campaigns he became enamoured of a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, Dona Mercia Lopes de Haro, whom he met during a visit to the Court of Castile, and under her influence his character deteriorated. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> renewed their complains of the disorders in Portugal, and in 1245, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "grandi non immerito", <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> committed the government to Sancho's brother Alfonso who was living in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. The latter undertook to remedy the ills of the kingdom and grievances of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and on his arrival the greater part of the country accepted him for regent in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> directions. Sancho, finding resistance hopeless, passed into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where he died a year later. In the reign of Alfonso III (1248-79) Portugal attained its farthest <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> limits by the conquest of The Algarve from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>, but Alfonso X of Castile claimed the kingdom, and the Portuguese king was forced to recognize <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> suzerainty and, though already married, to further purchase his possessions by agreeing to wed Beatrice, his brother monarch's <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> daughter. Fortunately, the first wife of Alfonso III died shortly afterwards, and the king's bigamous union with Beatrice and their issue were legitimated by <a href="../cathen/15212a.htm">Urban IV</a> at the request of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p>So far there had been peace between the king and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but the former did not intend to keep the promises on the strength of which he had ascended the throne, and the latter would not abate their claims. In 1258 Alfonso sent a commission of inquiry through the kingdom to determine the royal <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and fiscal <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of his subjects, and as result he revoked, in 1265, many of the crown grants of land. Seven of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> took up the challenge, and in 1267 appealed to <a href="../cathen/04019a.htm">Clement IV</a>. They alleged that the king, besides seizing their possessions, deprived them of their liberty of action, refused to pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, exacted forced loans, compelled ladies to marry men of no birth, and men of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to wed low <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, or those of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> or Jewish race. The abuses of civil administration were dealt with in five articles, <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> grievances occupied forty-three. The charges were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in the main, but the king met them by presenting to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a petition signed by all the <em>concelhos</em> in favour of his rule, and, to defeat the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by a policy of delay, he took the Cross for a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> led by St. Louis, but never went. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and some of the protesting <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> died, while certain abuses were remedied. Relying on his good fortune he became more oppressive than ever, usurping the revenues of four sees, and in 1273 <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> ordered the heads of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Orders in <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> to remonstrate with the king. It was long before Alfonso would see them and then he assembled the cortes at Santarem and had a committee appointed to correct everything done "without reason". This committee was composed of his friends so that the concession was illusory. On hearing of the king's duplicity, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sent him a strongly-worded <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 4 Sept., 1275, reminding him of what he owed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and requiring him to keep the agreement made in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> under pain of censure and, in the last resort, of losing the realm.

<p>Again, however, time favoured the king, for <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory</a> and his two successors all died in 1276, and, though the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/08429c.htm">John XXI</a> took the matter up, the king would do nothing until the terms of <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory's</a> <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>, which he called <em>ordinatio diabolica</em>, were softened. An <a href="../cathen/08073a.htm">interdict</a> was therefore pronounced on the realm, and Alfonso's subjects were absolved from their allegiance, but without effect, for the king had a stronger position than Sancho II. However, he relented when death approached; he promised restitution to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and made his heir swear to perform what he himself had promised. His understanding with the municipalities enabled Alfonso III to consolidate the power of the Crown by limiting that of the nobility, both <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">lay</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a>, and even to <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">brave</a> the censures of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which by constant repetition had lost some of their effect. Denis (1279-1325), a cultured man, abstained from foreign <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and developed himself to developing the resources of the country, his care to agriculture winning him the title of "the Cultivator". He favoured commerce, founded the royal navy, and above all gave peace to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. After long negotiations a <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordat</a> of forty articles was signed in 1289, and this was followed by two others. The <em>beneplacitum regium</em> was abandoned, the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> seized by Alfonso III was restored, and the king bound himself to respect <a href="../cathen/12437a.htm">ecclesiastical privileges</a> and <a href="../cathen/07690a.htm">immunities</a>, and to observe the old <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and customs of the realm. The free election of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was secured, and the extortions practised by lay patrons of churches and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were prohibited.

<p>The long struggle between <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and Crown terminated; but if the first gained most of the points contended for, its commanding position ceased. With the increasing weakness of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> became more dependent on the monarch. Moreover, the complete nationalization of the <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a> effected by Denis also tended to increase the central power, and it was of him "that he did all he wished". On the initiative and at the expense of the Priors of Santa Cruz at <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, S. Vicente at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, and Santa Maria at Guimaraens and the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Alcobaca, a <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> was established at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> and confirmed, in 1290, by <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Bull</a>, with faculties of arts, canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>, and medicine, but not <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, which was studied in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. The king showed great liberality to the new foundation, which was subsequently, by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> permission, moved to Coimbra. When the <a href="../cathen/14493a.htm">Templars</a> were suppressed, <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> allowed their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to go to the new Order of Christ established in 1319.

<p>If Denis <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a wise and just ruler, some of the credit is due to his wife, St. Isabel. She intervened successfully more than once to end the rebellions of his son. Alfonso IV, (1325-57) continued his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> policy. He lived on good terms with the other peninsular sovereigns, but when his daughter was ill-treated by her husband, Alfonso XI, he invaded Castile. Once more St. Isabel intervened. Leaving her <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a> at <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, she came between the opposing armies at Estremoz, and settled the dispute so effectually that when, in 1340, the King of <a href="../cathen/10574a.htm">Morocco</a> crossed into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to aid the King of <a href="../cathen/06723a.htm">Granada</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, Alfonso IV <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> summons and led a contingent which helped Alfonso XI to win the great battle of Salado. His later years were clouded by the Black Death and the rebellion of son Pedro, who, though married, had become enamoured of the beautiful Dona Ines de Castro. To end this infatuation, Alfonso was unfortunately persuaded to consent to her assassination, whereupon the prince rose in arms against his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> and devastated the country. <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Benedict XII</a> exacted the payment of the tribute promised by Alfonso Henriques and took measures against the incontinency of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (a recurring <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in Portuguese history), while <a href="../cathen/04023a.htm">Clement VI</a> answered the complaints of the Kings of Portugal and Castile as the appointment of foreigners to <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefices</a>. The chief characteristic of Pedro I (1357-67), was the pleasure he took in seeking out and punishing lawbreakers, whether <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>; hence his title, "the Doer of Justice". Allying himself with Pedro the Cruel of Castile, he took summary vengeance on the murderers of his mistress. He repressed the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the nobles and the <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and this with his generosity earned him the respect of the people, savage despot though he was. It is noteworthy that an especial avenger of adulteries, as well as of <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witchcraft</a>, he lived an immoral life and had several bastards, one of whom became King John I.

<p>The chief <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> interest this uneventful reign centered in the Cortes of Elvas, in which the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> submitted a list of thirty-three grievances, some of which received attention. As regards the admission of <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letters</a>, the king promised to see them and order their publication in so far as was right. It was a shuffling reaffirmation of the <em>beneplacitum regium</em>. Ferdinand (1367-83) had his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father's</a> generosity without his strength, and, though he deserves the credit for wise <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> encouraging navigation and agriculture, and for the fortification of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, he fell a victim to animal passion and foolish <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>. His first attempt to win the Throne of Castile against Henry of Tratamara failed, and in 1371 the Peace of Alcoutim was made under the auspices of <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a>, Ferdinand agreeing to marry Henry's daughter. But he could never keep a treaty, and, having fallen in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with Dona Leonor Telles, the wife of one of his nobles, he married her, notwithstanding the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> protest of the citizens of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>. Moreover he entered into an agreement to assist John of Gaunt, who claimed the crown of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castile</a>. Henry thereupon invaded Portugal, in 1373, and would have captured <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, had not Cardinal Guy de Bologne, the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a>, forced him to retire and make peace with Ferdinand at Vallada. Leonor now entirely dominated her vacillating and indolent husband, and by obtaining honors and lands for her kinsfolk and friends provided against the time when he should die. Losing all scruples, she engineered the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of her own sister, and betrayed the king by an intrigue with the Galician noble, Andeiro, whom she persuaded him to create Count of Ourem. A few years later <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> was again besieged unsuccessfully by a <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> army, and in 1381 Ferdinand undertook a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of revenge with the help of an English force under the Duke of Cambridge. He invaded Castile, but when in the presence of the enemy took fright and made peace with King John, one of the terms being that the latter should wed Ferdinand's heiress Beatrice, which would have led to the union of Portugal and Castile.

<p>At the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Great Schism</a> it was only the firmness of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> that kept Portugal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a> and prevented the king from offering his obedience to the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="../cathen/13096c.htm">Clement VII</a>. The resistance of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> to two <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Castilian</a> sieges had saved Portuguese independence, and by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> its see was raised to <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank. The people would not submit to a foreign king, and shortly after Ferdinand's death the citizens of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> rose against Leonor; Andeiro and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> were slain, and John, Grand Master of Aviz, <a href="../cathen/07650a.htm">illegitimate</a> son of Pedro I, became defender of the realm. The King of Castile laid seige to <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, but a pestilence compelled him to retire, and in April, 1385, thanks to the eloquence of the great lawyer John das Regras, the Grand Master of Aviz was elected king (1385-1433) at the Cortes of Coimbra. On 14 August he totally defeated the Castilians at Aljubarrota, and this, together with the victories gained by Nuno Alvares Pereira, "the Holy Constable", secured Portuguese independence. The king erected on the field of battle the great <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Batalha and there he and his sons were buried. On 9 May, 1388, he made the Treaty of Windsor with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and, though a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>, sealed the alliance by wedding Philippa, daughter of John of Gaunt. In 1391 <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> legitimated the marriage.

<p>Portugal now turned her face to the ocean and prepared to become a great maritime power. The oversea conquest began with the capture of Ceuta, in 1415, and under the auspices of Prince Henry the Navigator the voyages were organized which ultimately led to the discovery of the road to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> round the Cape of Good Hope. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> encouraged these efforts, which had for their object the spread of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> as well as of commerce, and, by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 4 April, 1418, confirmed to the king all the lands he should take from the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>. In the previous year Ceuta had been created a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, and it was the first of many sees erected in non-Christian countries where the Portuguese carried their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and flag. John made two <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordats</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the first at the Cortes of Elvas, the second, in 1427, at the Cortes of Santarem, but he did not abandon the <em>beneplacitum regium</em>. He had been compelled to make large grants to the nobles as the price of their support in the War of Independence. One of the first acts of his son Edward (in Portuguese Duarte-1433-38) was to <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgate</a> the "Lei Mental" which enacted that these properties should only descend in the direct male line of the grantee, on the failure of which they reverted to the Crown. The ill result of the expedition against Tangier, which was undertaken against the advice of <a href="../cathen/05601a.htm">Eugenius IV</a> and ended in the captivity of the Infanta Ferdinand, hastened the end of the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, and Alfonso V (1438-81) succeeded to the throne in childhood. The people would not accept his mother, Queen Leonor, as regent, and that office was conferred on the Infanta Pedro, Edward's brother. The queen and her party never forgave this act; they stirred up Alfonso against his uncle, who was defeated and slain at the battle of Alfarroeira. The authors of this tragedy were <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and relations between Portugal and <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> ceased, but were reestablished in 1451, and from 1452 onwards became very close.

<p>Alfonso, a typical <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">medieval knight</a>, full of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusading</a> spirit, was bent on fighting the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>, and he received every encouragement. <a href="../cathen/11058a.htm">Nicholas V</a>, by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of 8 January, 1454, conceded to him all conquests in Africa from Cape Non to Guinea, with power to build churches the patronage of which should be his, and prohibited any vessels from sailing to those parts without leave from the King of Portugal. By another <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of the same <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> extended Portuguese dominion over all the seas from <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a> to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. A subsequent <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> granted to the Order of Christ authority in spirituals over the peoples subdued by the Portuguese as far as <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, and provided that no one but the King of Portugal should be entitled to send expeditions of discovery to those parts. Finally, in 1481, <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> confirmed to the kings of Portugal all islands and territories discovered now or in the future from Cape Non to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. The voyages continued during Alfonso's reign, and the equator was passed in 1471. But the king thought more of land conquests in North Africa, where he made three successful expeditions, and continued to covet the throne of the neighbouring country until he was defeated, in 1476, at the battle of Toro. His reign was rendered notable by the publication, in 1446 of the Alfonsine Code.

<p>John II (1481-95) showed great energy in the work of discovery, which had been somewhat neglected since the death of Prince Henry, and under his auspices Bartholomew Diaz passed the Cape of Good Hope in 1486, and in 1498 <a href="../cathen/06374a.htm">Vasco da Gama</a> reached <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>. A firm believer in absolute government and a man of inflexible will, John broke the power of the nobility, which had become enormous through the unwise liberality of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, following on the donations of John I. He deprived them of their right to administer <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> on their estates, and when they resisted, led by the Duke of Braganza, the king had him arrested and beheaded, and completed his work by himself stabbing the Duke of Viseu and ordering the execution of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05670a.htm">Evora</a> and others. A great confiscation of estates followed and enriched the Crown, which now became the one power of the realm. John maintained good relations with Castile and, in 1494, made the Treaty of Tordesillas, confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>, by which the limits of the possessions of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and Portugal in the regions discovered by their seamen were fixed by an imaginary line drawn at 360 leagues west of Cape Verde, the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> acquiring the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to all lands lying to the west and the Portuguese getting those to the east. Under this division of the world most of the coastline of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> found in 1500 fell to Portugal, and the rest of America and West Indies to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>.

<p>Provincial and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> had become less frequent with each succeeding century (in the fifteenth century not one provincial synod was held) with the result that <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> declined. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the best-endowed sees were almost invariably chosen from noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> and some of them lived away from their diocese. This was the case with Ceuta and Tangier. By a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 13 October, 1501, issued at the instance of King Emanuel, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were ordered to fulfil their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of visitation, which they seem to have generally neglected. From the beginning, the monastic orders and the chapters had attracted the best talents, and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were usually as <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> as they were poor. <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a> had to issue a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> in 1485, providing that no one unable to construe Latin well should be <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a>. The prevailing laxity had affected the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, but the orders themselves responded to the desires of the king and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. A reform of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> began at Bemfica and spread to the other houses. The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> was equally marked, no less than twenty-three <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of Observants were founded within a century, and these despite the opposition of the <a href="../cathen/04344a.htm">Conventuals</a>, restored the order to its pristine purity.

<p>King Emanuel (1495-1521) reaped the harvest sown by his predecessors, and every year of his reign witnessed some new discovery, some great deed. The genius of Alburquerque gave him the maritime keys of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, and the monopoly of the Eastern trade made him the richest king in <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a>. In 1514 the monarch sent his splendid embassy to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to offer the tribute of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> at the feet of <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a>, to urge the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to proceed with the reform of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to secure a league of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>. Though these objects failed, the king obtained many personal favours, including the amplification of the <em>Padroado</em>, or right of patronage over churches in non-Christian countries. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> received the submission of the <a href="../cathen/01075e.htm">Abyssinian</a> Church through Emanuel and, recognizing the king as the chief protector and propagator of the Faith, twice sent him the <a href="../cathen/06629a.htm">Golden Rose</a>. Emanuel was especially anxious to add Castile to his world-wide dominions, and he made three marriages to that end, but all in vain. It was a condition of his first marriage (to the eldest daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella) that he should expel the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and unconverted <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had enjoyed the protection of previous kings and had supplied them with trusted servants, but, as both the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the people <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> them for their <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envied</a> their talents and wealth, Emanuel sacrificed them, against the protests of some of his best councillors. They were given the choice of conversion or exile, and naturally, from worldly motives, the greater part accepted the former alternative and became known as "new Christians", intermarrying with old <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Many of these converts went back to <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> and became the victims of bitter and continual <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> was established.

<p>King Emanuel and his son, John III, were great builders; the former erected the <a href="../cathen/07345a.htm">Hieronymite</a> church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Belem, to commemorate <a href="../cathen/06374a.htm">Vasco da Gama's</a> discovery, and the later made great additions to the superb <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Christ at Tomar. Though the Golden Age apparently continued, Portugal began to decline in the reign of John III (1521-57). Emigration drained the best blood of the country; the East corrupted, while it enriched, its conquerors; the cultivation of the soil was left to slaves; commerce was blighted by the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, which drove capital abroad. The Government could not make both ends meet, and the wealth of the Hebrews invited their spoliation. The king, a serious, conscientious man, but of small <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, satisfied the complaints of the people against that race by petitioning the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in 1531 to establish the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>. After a twenty years' struggle at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with the Hebrews, marked by disgraceful bribery on both sides, John forced the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> consent in 1547, and the bigoted Infanta Henry, afterwards king, became chief inquisitor. The tribunal was popular and practically destroyed <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, but its methods divided the nation into spies and victims, encouraged blackmail and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> denunciations, and contributed to undermine the national character. It put a new weapon into the hands of the monarch, who now had no check on his rule, for the Cortes had lost their power by the end of the preceding century. In 1540 the first <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> came, and the king became a warm patron of their early missionary labours in the East. In addition to the ministry of the confessional and the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> devoted itself to teaching and opened colleges which were crowded by youths of the better classes. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, which since its foundation had moved to and fro between <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> and Coimbra, was fixed at the latter place in 1537, and distinguished professors, Portuguese and foreign, raised its <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> level. Experience <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> however that their learning was superior to their <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, and they were replaced by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who by degrees obtained that control of higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> which they held for two centuries.

<p>John deserves credit for his policy of peace abroad and for the colonization of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, in which he had the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, who civilized the natives and protected them from the <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> settlers. A number of the new colonial <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> were founded in this reign, and Portuguese <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> among them Ven. Bartholomew of the Martyrs, took a prominent part in the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. On John's death, his <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> became regent for her grandson Sebastian (1557-78), who was a minor. The latter grew up an exalted mystic and <a href="../cathen/03691a.htm">knight</a> errant of the Cross, without interest in the work of government. Though pressed by <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a>, he refused to marry and obstinately insisted on attempting to conquer North Africa without sufficient men or money. His rout and death at the battle of Alcacer decided the fate of Portugal, for Cardinal Henry (1578-80) lived less than two years, and in 1580 <a href="../cathen/12002a.htm">Philip II of Spain</a> claimed the throne as next heir. Partly by force and partly by bribery, he secured election as Philip I of Portugal (1580-98) at the Cortes of Thomar in 1581, and for sixty years the Crowns of Portugal and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> were united. If Philip I and II (1598-1621) ruled well, the period was none the less a disastrous one from a religious, as from a political point of view, and Portugal suffered heavily in the duel between the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Powers and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. Her Eastern possessions fell into the hands of the English and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>, and the latter seized a large part of the coastline of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>. The monetary exactions of Philip III (1621-40) and the determination of his minister Olivares, to destroy the liberties of Portugal, aroused in all classes a fierce hostility to foreign rule. The lower <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders embraced the popular cause. The tolerance shown to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who were permitted to return, and the expulsion of the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a>, Castracani, outraged their feelings, and the increasing burden of taxation pressed them hard, so that they encouraged their flocks to look for a deliverer in the Duke of Braganza and greatly contributed to issue.

<p>The revolution of 1640 raised John IV (1540-56) to the throne, and liberated Portugal and her remaining possessions from a foreign yoke, but it led to an exhausting <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> which lasted twenty-eight years. Moreover, owing to Spanish pressure, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> refused to recognize the new monarch; see after see fell vacant and remained so, and <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> became relaxed. These evils continued during the reign of Alfonso VI (1656-83), an imbecile youth of criminal tastes, who was deposed in 1667, his brother Pedro becoming regent and, on Alfonso's death, ascending the throne. The reign of Pedro (1683-1706) is marked by the discovery of gold in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, by the signature of the Methuen Treaty with <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and by the participation of Portugal in the War of the Spanish Succession, when an Anglo-Portuguese army entered <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>. Though the Portuguese had lost most of their possessions in the East, their missionaries continued to spread the Faith in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> countries and actually defended remote possessions like Timor against the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a>. In 1690 the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Bishoprics</a> of Pekin and Nankin were established by <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Alexander VIII</a>, and, after a conflict with the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, the claim of Portugal to nominate <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> for all sees in the East was allowed.

<p>In 1691 the Cortes met for the last time previous to the Revolution of 1820. The leading <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> figure of the age was Father Antonio Vieira, preacher, protector of the Indians of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, and confidential agent of John IV. The relations between the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> had never been cordial, and the tribunal, aware of Vieira's sympathy for the converted <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and anxious to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a>, condemned certain propositions taken from his writings, sentenced him to seclusion in a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a>, and deprived him of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to preach. Thereupon Vieira went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and presented a memorial to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, who ordered an inquiry into the methods of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> and suspended it until reforms should be introduced. It submitted after a struggle, and, when <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> revoked the suspension in 1681, the tribunal had to adopt a milder procedure. The gold and diamonds of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> enabled John V (1706-50) to imitate <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> in magnificence. To licentious habits he united a taste for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> pomp. He displayed his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> by building an enormous pile, church, and palace in one, at Mafra, by providing the large sums required in connection with the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of various <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and by obtaining from the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> the elevation of the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> to the dignity of a <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>, together with the title, for himself and his successors, of "Most Faithful Magesty". Except in the case of the <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> aqueduct, the country reaped small benefit from the vast sums expended by the artistic, pleasure-loving monarch; and if religion was outwardly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a>, the bad example set by John helped to lower the already impaired national standard of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. The nobility had by this time ceased to visit their estates and degenerated into a race of mere courtiers. The interests of the common people were neglected by the Government, almost their only friends being the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. At the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> bidding, John sent a fleet against the <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> which helped to win the battle of Matapan in 1717.

<p>The reign of Joseph (1750-77) is made famous by the administration of the <a href="../cathen/12224b.htm">Marquess of Pombal</a>, the real ruler of Portugal for over twenty years. The energy he displayed at the time of the great earthquaque of 1755 confirmed his hold over the king, and with royal support he was able to use the alleged "Tavora Conspiracy" to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> the nobility and to continue the campaign he was directing against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, whom he was determined to master. His accusations against them of seditious conduct in the missions and of illicit trading were merely pretexts. He had already dismissed them from Court, delated them to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and secured the appointment of a friend of his, Cardinal Saldanha, as their reformer, and when an attempt was made on the king's life he attributed it to <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> machinations, confiscated the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the company in the Portuguese dominions and expelled the Portuguese <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, retaining the foreigners in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> refused to incriminate the whole company for the faults of <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12224b.htm">Pombal's</a> reply was to dismiss the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> and break off relations with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Henceforth the real head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in Portugal was the Minister. He heaped ignominy on the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> by securing the burning of <a href="../cathen/09565c.htm">Father Malagrida</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, and his work was completed when, under pressure from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Powers, <a href="../cathen/04034a.htm">Clement XIV</a> <a href="../cathen/14096a.htm">suppressed the Society</a> in 1773. <a href="../cathen/12224b.htm">Pombal's</a> ruin of the Foreign Missions was perhaps his greatest crime and was by no means compensated for by his abolition of slavery and of the distinction between old and new <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. He undoubtedly made great and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> reforms in internal administration and freed Portugal for the time from its subservience to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, but his commercial policy was a failure, and the harm he did far outweighed the good. Above all he forged those fetters for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which still paralyse her action.

<p>The death of Joseph brought about the fall of the minister, but the new sovereigns Pedro and Maria (1777-1816), while opening the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> which <a href="../cathen/12224b.htm">Pombal</a> had filled with his opponents, left much of his work untouched. The king died early, the queen lost her reason, and their son John, a sympathetic but weak man, was named regent. <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> &#151; those of the <a href="../cathen/05418a.htm">Encyclopedists</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> &#151; were kept out of the country as long as possible, but the <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> gave little hope of security to a small kingdom which was regarded as the dependent of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The Treaty of Fontainebleau divided the country between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>; the famous proclamation was issued, stating that the House of Braganza had ceased to reign, and Junot with a French army occupied <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> in 1807. The royal family fled to <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, and Portugal was governed from there until 1820. Queen Maria died at the close of the Peninsular War, which led to the overthrow of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleonic</a> power, and John VI (1816-26) came to the throne. The Revolution of 1820 forced him to return home, and he had to accept a constitution of a most radical character, for which the country was entirely unfitted. One calamity succeeded another. The opening of the ports of <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> to foreign ships ruined Portuguese commerce, the separation of the colony diminished the prestige of the mother country, which was reduced to a miserable plight by the long <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and internal feuds were added to external troubles. On the death of John, his son Pedro IV gave a new constitution, called "the Charter", and then resigned the throne in favour of his infant daughter Maria II, naming his brother Miguel regent. The Conservatives, or Absolutist Party, however, who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> the Charter as the work of <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> and <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasons</a>, desired him as king, and he summoned a Cortes of the old type which placed him on the throne in 1828. The Radicals and Chartists at once organized resistance to what they called the usurpation and, after a long civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, were successful. By the Convention of <a href="../cathen/05670a.htm">Evora</a> Monte, Miguel had to abandon his claims and leave the country. The victorious <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberals</a> initiated an era of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the effects of which are still felt. The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders were the first to go. The orders of men were suppressed, and their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> confiscated, nominally to enrich the treasury, but private <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> reaped the benefit. The orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were allowed to die out, further professions being prohibited. The people, deprived of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/06280b.htm">friars</a>, who were their teachers, preachers, and confessors, gradually lost their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> were unprepared to take the place of the orders; besides which, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were bound hand and foot to the State.

<p>The last half-century of the Portuguese Monarchy, embracing the reigns of Pedro V (1853-61), Louis I (1861-89), and Charles I (1889-1908), was one of internal peace and increasing material prosperity. But only in the last few years have Portuguese <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> begun to emerge from a state of lethargy. Modern Portuguese statesmen, usually <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> only in name, have interested themselves in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs to preserve old privileges, such as the Padroado in the East, but hardly ever assist the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the performance of her Divine mission. The concordat of 1886 regulated many of the questions in dispute with the State and Hintze Ribeiro's <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 1896 authorized the existence of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders under certain conditions. The prospect of better conditions for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> vanished, however, with the coming of the Revolution in 1910, which drove the Braganza dynasty from the throne, and delivered Portugal into the hands of the Radicals, whose hostility to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion was made evident by the adverse course of the Provisional Government set up by the Revolutionists. On 1 February, 1908, King Charles and the Crown Prince were assassinated in the streets of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> was perpetrated by a man named Buica and several associates, and was applauded by the Republican press. The succession devolved on the second son, who ascended the throne as Emanuel II. His reign was, however, brief. On 3 October, 1910, a revolution, which had been arranged for 10 October, broke out prematurely, and Emanuel fled the capital to Gilbratar, where he shortly afterwards embarked for <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. A provisional government, republican in form, was proclaimed, with Theophilus Braga, a native of the <a href="../cathen/02168a.htm">Azores</a>, as President. He immediately set to work to carry out the radical measures of the republican programme, the first of which was the summary and violent expulsion of the religious congregations, the seizure of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> by the State, the abolition of the Senate and all hereditary privileges and titles. The separation of the <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> was also arbitrarily decreed by the provisional government.

<p>On 20 April, 1911, a second <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, in 196 articles, was <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, regulating in detail the previously sweeping enactments. Article 38 of this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> prohibits any minister of religion, under the penalties of article 137 of the Criminal Code and the loss of the material benefits (pensions) of the State, from criticizing "in the exercise of his ministry and on the occasion of any act of worship, in sermons or in public writings, the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">public authority</a> or any of its acts, or the form of the government or the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Republic, or denying or calling into question the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the State embodied in this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> or in other legislation relative to the Churches". Chapter iv devotes twenty-seven articles to the ownership and administration of church buildings and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. Churches, <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>, lands, and chattels, hitherto applied to the public worship of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion are declared <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the State, unless <em><a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">bona fide</a></em> ownership by some private individual or corporation can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. Chapter v, in twenty-four articles, provides for boards of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> (after the manner of the French Law of Associations) to take charge of and administer the temporalities needed for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship. This arrangement is, however, revocable at the pleasure of the grantor (the State). Buildings intended for religious purposes, but not yet utilized, whether in course of construction or completed; buildings which for a year have not been used for religious purposes and such as by 31 December, 1912, shall have no board of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> to administer them, shall be taken by the State for some social purpose. Only Portuguese citizens who have made their <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies in Portugal may officiate. Chapter vi deals with the question of pensions for the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, and permits them to marry. Articles 175, chapter vii, stipulates that "ministers of religion enjoy no privileges and are authorized to correspond officially by mail with the public authorities only, and not with one another.

<p>A Constituent Assembly, elected early in the summer of 1911, on 19 June of that year formally decreed the abolition of the Portuguese monarchy.
<h2 id="section3">Actual conditions</h2>
<h3 id="A">Ecclesiastical organization</h3>

<p>By the Constitutional Charter Catholiscism was, prior to the Republic, the religion of the State, but all other <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> were tolerated, so long as they were not practised in a building having the exterior form of a church. Continental Portugal is divided ecclesiastically into three <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> provinces, containing twelve <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> (nine suffragan). The Patriarchate of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> has for suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> Guarda and Portalegre; the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> has those of Braganca, <a href="../cathen/08761b.htm">Lamego</a>, <a href="../cathen/04095b.htm">Coimbra</a>, <a href="../cathen/11260a.htm">Oporto</a>, and Viseu; the Archbishopric of <a href="../cathen/05670a.htm">Evora</a>, those of <a href="../cathen/02393a.htm">Beja</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789a.htm">Faro</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> is considered to be entitled to a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal's</a> hat, and the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a> bears the title of "Primate of the Spains", an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which, however, is disputed by Toledo. The <a href="../cathen/02168a.htm">Azores</a> and Madeira each contain an <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> and the colonial sees include those of Cape Verde, <a href="../cathen/01512b.htm">Angola</a>, <a href="../cathen/06602a.htm">Goa</a> (a <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchate</a>), <a href="../cathen/04610a.htm">Dam&atilde;o</a>, <a href="../cathen/04076a.htm">Cochin</a>, Mylapur, Mac&atilde;o, <a href="../cathen/10610a.htm">Mozambique</a>, and St. Thomas (S. Thom&eacute;).

<p>According to the Concordat of 1886, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were nominated by the Government, appointed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, and paid by the State. Parish <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were appointed by the minister of justice, after information as to their fitness supplied by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, so that they were State functionaries, and often owed their positions to political influence. To qualify for any <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> post, they had to obtain a government licence before taking orders. In the Islands the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were paid by the State, but on the Continent their income was derived partly from a fund called <em>Congrua</em>, which consisted of contributions levied on the parishioners, and partly from stole fees. There were twelve <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> on the Continent, two in the Islands, and four in other colonies. There is also a Portuguese College in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and one for Foreign Missionaries in Portugal. The <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> were supported partly by their own funds and partly by the Junta Geral da Bulla da Cruzada, an ancient institution which derived its income from offerings made for <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were exempt from military and jury service, and were ineligible for any administrative position, except the Parish Council (<em>Junta da Parochia</em>), of which the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is the president. These councils administered the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church and taxed the parishioners for the construction and repair of church and presbytery, the expenses of worship, church ornaments and vestments, etc. The <em>confrarias</em> and <em>irmandades</em>, which numbered about 9000, were independent bodies, ruled by their own <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>.
<h3 id="B">Religious orders</h3>

<p>How the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were expelled by <a href="../cathen/12224b.htm">Pombal</a>, and how, in 1834, the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders of men were suppressed and their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> seized by the State, has been told above. At the same time the orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were prohibited from taking <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> and were allowed to die out, after which their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> passed to the State, but by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 18 April, 1901, religious congregations were permitted to exist when they were dedicated exclusively to instruction or <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, or to spread <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and civilization in the colonies. Long before this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> had returned and opened colleges for the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth, and a number of orders and religious institutions were eventually established in Portugal. These included Missionaries of the Holy Ghost, <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a>, <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, Sisters of the Third <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Order of St. Dominic</a>, <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters, <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servite</a> Sisters, Dorotheans, Sisters of the Missions, <a href="../cathen/13398b.htm">Salesians</a>, Sisters of <a href="../cathen/08472c.htm">St. John of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08511a.htm">Sisters of St. Joseph</a> of Cluny, Marist Sisters, Sisters of St. Vicent de Paul, and Portuguese Sisters of Charity (Trinas).
<h3 id="C">Statistics of population</h3>

<p>The population of Portugal, according to the census of 1900, was 5,423,123, the greater portion (68 per cent) being rural. The North is more thickly populated than the South, the maximum of density being reached between the rivers Douro and Ave. Emigration is increasing. In 1907, 45,000 <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> left their homes, 24,000 of those for <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> and 6000 for North America.
<h3 id="D">Education</h3>

<p>The first modern law providing for the general instruction of the people was that of the <a href="../cathen/12224b.htm">Marquess of Pombal</a>, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 6 November, 1772. But this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> remained a dead letter, and, though the Constitutional Charter guaranteed free primary instruction to all citizens, and a multitude of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> dealing with the question have been subsequently passed, at least 70 per cent of the population can neither read nor write. The direction of primary <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> was formerly exercised by the <a href="../cathen/04095c.htm">University of Coimbra</a>, but it now belongs to the Home Office, the cost being borne partly by the Concelhos, partly by the State. At the end of 1904 there were 4968 primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> on the Continent and the adjacent islands, 2953 being for boys, 1549 for girls and 466 mixed, but some of these only exist on paper, and some hundreds of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> have no <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. Moreover, the conditions of large proportion of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are not good, while the teachers are ill-prepared and ill-paid. The backward condition of Portugal is largely attributable to its lack of instruction, and in view of the want of interest shown by the Government in non-political questions, private <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> are endeavoring to apply the remedy. Among these are the Moveable Schools which teach according to the methods of the poet Jo&atilde;o de Deus, the recently formed National League of Instruction and other bodies, most of which are <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">Freethinking</a> in character. Before the Revolution the Republicans had identified themselves with a movement for lay-teaching, and their various centres had free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> attached, for the instruction of the children of their members.

<p>Secondary instruction is given in <em>lyceos</em>, which are found in all the principal towns, and in technical <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>; but the boys of the better classes, prior to the Republic, were largely confided to the care of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, and the girls to one of the many <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> which then existed. There are also many private <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, some conducted by foreigners, where an ordinary business <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> can be had. The religious instruction of the people was far from satisfactory, and since the advent of the Republic is less so. Catechism used to be included in the curriculum of the government primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, but under the Republican regime is altogether excluded. There is no religious teaching in the <em>lyceos</em>, which are day <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, without proper discipline or any attempt at the formation of character. Higher <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> is given in the <a href="../cathen/04095c.htm">University of Coimbra</a> (with about 1450 students) and in various establishments of a special character, such as the Curso Superior das Letras, the Medical, Army, Navy, and Polytechnic Schools, in <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> and <a href="../cathen/11260a.htm">Oporto</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> has a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> faculty, with but very few students, owing to its unorthodox character. Ignorance of religion and of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, and the reading of bad literature go far to explain the anti-clerical feeling which prevails among the people generally in the towns, and especially in the capital. The Press is intellectually of little account, and its moral tone is low, especially in the case of the Republican organs, some of the most circulated of which are not fit for perusal by <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> organs, "Portugal" of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> and "Palavra" of <a href="../cathen/11260a.htm">Oporto</a>, before they were suppressed by the Republic, enjoyed an increasing circulation, but an avowedly religious is suspected by the great majority of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who fear to be dubbed reactionary. It is the commonest <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a> to be considered Liberal, though the word is a misnomer in Portugal, where it stands for many <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> and aspirations essentially illiberal. The Republicans, though many of them profess <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> have always been an anti-clerical party. They aim to defend the native <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular clergy</a> against <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders who are mostly composed of foreigners, and especially against the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>. They generally favour <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">civil marriage</a>, a <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> law, the abolition of religious processions in the streets etc. The Socialists go further and are frankly godless.
<h3 id="D">Laws affecting religion</h3>

<p>Previous to the Revolution of 1910, a testator might only dispose freely of a third part of his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> by will; this is called the <em>ter&ccedil;a</em>. The remaining two-thirds go to form the <em>legitima</em> of his heirs in the ascending and descending line. A testator may not bequeath more than a third of his ter&ccedil;a to be spent in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and masses for his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> corporations may not benefit under his will to an amount exceeding the third of his ter&ccedil;a. The testamentary dispositions of a sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> in favour of his confessor, except such as are merely remunerative, are void if he dies of the illness during which he made them. Professed religious <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> cannot make wills until they become secularized or their communities are suppressed, nor can they acquire anything by will, except by way of aliment, or money legacy, or other moveables. The Civil Code makes no mention of men bound by religious <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them.

<p>There was, under the Monarchy, no <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> law in Portugal, but a marriage could be declared null for reasons allowed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The canonical impediments were recognized by the Code. Civil marriage and interment were permitted, but made small headway, and the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> registers continued to be almost universally used, though there was a civil register of births, <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, and deaths. The courts could <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> separation of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and goods (1) in case of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> by the wife, (2) in case of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and desertion by the husband, or <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">public scandal</a>; (3) when one of the parties had been guilty of outrageous cruelty to the other. Children born out of wedlock were legitimated by the subsequent marriage of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, when the latter formally recognized them, or when the children themselves obtained a judicial sentence in their favour.

<p>Cemeteries were provided and controlled by the municipalities in the chief places of each district. Outside of these, they were established at the expense of the parishioners by the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> council, to which they belonged. The <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">death penalty</a> has long been abolished in Portugal, which may account in part for the large number of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murders</a>. Criminals sentenced to long terms of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisonment</a> were sent to the Penitenciaria in <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> and there are <em>casas de correc&ccedil;&atilde;o</em>, or reformatories, for small boys and girls. Good Shepherd homes for fallen <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> existed at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> and Oporto, but were suppressed by the Provisional Government at the time of the Revolution. Charitable institutions abounded, and Portugal had, under the Monarchy, some 370 <em>Misericordias</em> and <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>. In the various districts of <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, the <em>cozinhas economicas</em>, an institution founded and largely supported by the late Duchess of Palmella, provided cheap meals for the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and Queen Amelia's crusade against tuberculosis led to the establishment of free consulting <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a> and sanatoria in different parts of the country.

<p>As a result of the encyclicals of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> on <a href="../cathen/04708a.htm">Christian democracy</a>, the movement for the establishment of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> circles for workingmen was inaugurated in Portugal, and these mutual-aid <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> existed in the principal centres of population, furnished <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to the workmen and their children, and kept them together by conferences, concerts, and excursions. The associations of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> youth in <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> and Oporto also deserve mention. But the sweeping measures inaugurated by the Republican Government effected a complete rupture of the former relations between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, and the status of the various <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> organizations, aside from the religious congregations (which were immediately dissolved), has become very uncertain.
