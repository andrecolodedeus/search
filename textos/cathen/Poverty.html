<h1>Poverty</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">The moral doctrine of poverty</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> did not condemn the possession of worldly goods, or even of great wealth; for He himself had rich friends. Patristic tradition condemns the opponents of private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>; the texts on which such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> rely, when taken in connexion with their context and the historical circumstances, are capable of a natural explanation which does not at all support their contention (cf. Vermeersch, "Qu&aelig;st. de justitia", n. 210). Nevertheless it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that Christ constantly pointed out the danger of riches, which, He says, are the thorns that choke up the good seed of the word (<a href="../bible/mat013.htm#vrs22">Matthew 13:22</a>). Because of His poverty as well as of His constant journeying, necessitated by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, He could say: "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air nests: but the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a> hath not where to lay his head" (<a href="../bible/mat008.htm#vrs20">Matthew 8:20</a>), and to the young man who came to ask Him what he should do that he might have life everlasting, He gave the counsel, "If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give to the poor" (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs16">Matthew 19:16-21</a>). The renunciation of worldly possessions has long been a part of the practice of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> asceticism; the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in their first fervour sold their goods "and divided them to all, according as every one had need" (<a href="../bible/act002.htm#vrs45">Acts 2:45</a>), and those who embraced the state of perfection understood from the first that they must choose poverty.

<p>Does this mean that poverty is the object of a special virtue? <a href="../cathen/07089a.htm">Gury</a> (Theolog. moralis II, n. 155) answers the question in the affirmative, and many religious writers favour the same opinion, which is supported by the ordinary conventual and ascetical literature; what is prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty is compared therein with the virtue of poverty, just as we compare the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of obedience and chastity with the corresponding virtues. But this is <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a>; for the object of a virtue must be something honourable or praiseworthy in itself: now poverty has no intrinsic <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, but is good only because it is useful to remove the obstacles which stand in the way of the pursuit of spiritual perfection (<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, "Contra Gentiles", III, cxxxiii; Francisco Su&aacute;rez, "De religione", tr. VII, l. VIII, c. ii, n. 6; Bucceroni, "Inst. theol. mor.", II, 75, n. 31). The practice of poverty derives its merit from the virtuous motive ennobling it, and from the virtues which we exercise in regard to the privations and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> accompanying it. As every <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> has for its object the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, poverty practised under a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> has the merit of the virtue of religion, and its public profession, as enjoined by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, forms a part of the ritual of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion.

<p>The ancients understood the nobility of making themselves independent of the fleeting things of earth, and certain Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> lived in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> penury; but they prided themselves on being superior to the vulgar crowd. There is no virtue in such poverty as this, and when Diogenes trampled <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> carpet, saying as he did so: "Thus do I trample on Plato's pride", "Yes", answered <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, "but only through your own <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>." <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> also teaches the contempt of riches; in <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a> the tenth precept of the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> forbids them to touch gold or silver, and the second precept of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> forbids them to possess anything of their own; but their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of a personal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> prevents the <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhist</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from having any higher motive for their renunciation than the natural advantage of restraining their desires (cf. Wieger, "Bouddhisme chinois", pp. 153, 155, 183, 185). If <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> poverty is ennobled by the motive which inspires it, the poverty which puts aside temporal possessions for the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is the most noble of all. It is the apostolic poverty of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> which is practised in the highest degree by missionaries in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> countries, and to a certain degree by all priests: all these <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> give up certain possessions and advantages in order to devote themselves entirely to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>Voluntary poverty is the object of one of the evangelical counsels. The question then arises, what poverty is required by the practice of this counsel or, in other words, what poverty suffices for the state of perfection? The renunciation which is essential and strictly required is the abandonment of all that is superfluous, not that it is absolutely <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to give up the ownership of all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, but a man must be contented with what is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for his own use. Then only is there a real detachment which sufficiently mortifies the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of riches, cuts off luxury and vain glory, and frees from the care for worldly goods. Cupidity, vain glory, and excessive solicitude are, according to <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, the three obstacles which riches put in the way of acquiring perfection (Summa, II-II, Q. clxxxviii, a. 7). This abandonment of superfluities was the only way in which <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> poverty could be understood before the introduction of the common life. The state of perfection, understood in its proper sense, requires also that the renunciation should be of a permanent character; and in practice this stability follows as the result of a perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty. The warnings and counsels of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> are valuable even to those who are not vowed to a state of perfection. They teach men to moderate their desire for riches, and accept cheerfully the loss or deprivation of them; and they inculcate that detachment from the things of this world which our Lord taught when He said, "Everyone of you that doth not renounce all that he possesseth, cannot be my disciple" (Luke xiv 33).


<h2 id="section2">The canonical discipline of poverty</h2>

<p>Among the followers of perfection, the spirit of poverty was manifested from the first by giving up temporal possessions; and among those living in community, the use of goods as private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was strictly forbidden, being contrary to that common life which the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> of monasticism, <a href="../cathen/11381a.htm">St. Pachomius</a> and his disciple Sch&eacute;noudi, <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, and St. Benedict, imposed upon their followers. But there was at that time no express <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty, and no legal disability; the monastic profession required nothing but the rigorous avoidance of all that was unnecessary (cf. <a href="../cathen/11742b.htm">De Buck</a>, "Do sollemnitate votorum, pr&aelig;cipue paupertatis religios&aelig; epistola", x). Justinian ordained that the goods of religious should belong to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (Novel. 5, iv sqq.; 123, xxxviii and xlii). This law gradually came into force, and in time created a disability to acquire <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, although in the twelfth century, and even later, there were religious in possession of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The rule of French law, under which a religious was considered as Civilly dead, contributed to establish a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> connexion between the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty and the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of disability.

<p>The express <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of renunciation of all private <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> was introduced into the profession of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> in 1260. About the same time another change took place; hitherto no limit had been placed on the common possessions of religious, but the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> in the thirteenth century forbade the possession, even in common, of all immovable <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> distinct from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, and of all revenues; and the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> of the strict observance, desiring to go one step further, assigned to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the ownership of all their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, even the most indispensable. Following the example of St. Francis and <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>, many founders established their orders on a basis of common poverty, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> saw a large increase in the number of the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a> until the foundation of the clerks regular in the sixteenth century; even then, many orders united common poverty with the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> life: such were the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a> (1524), whose rule was to live on <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> and contributions spontaneously given; and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> (1540). It soon became evident that this profession of poverty which had so greatly edified the thirteenth century was exposed to grave abuses, that a certain state of destitution created more cares than it removed, and was not conducive either to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> activity or to strict observance; and that mendicity might become an occasion of <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a>. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXV, c. iii, de reg.) permitted all <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, except those of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> Observantines and the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, to possess immovable <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and consequently the income derived therefrom; but the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, in its professed houses, continue to practise the common poverty which forbids the possession of assured incomes.

<p>Congregations with simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> were not bound by the canonical law forbidding the private possession or acquisition of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> by members of approved orders: the disability of private possession was thus considered as an effect of the solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty; but this bond between the incapacity to possess and the solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is neither essential nor indissoluble. So far as the effect of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> on private possession is concerned, the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty taken by the formed coadjutors of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> has the same effect as the solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of the professed fathers. St. Ignatius instituted in his order a simple profession preparatory to the final one with an interval between them during which the religious retains his capacity to possess <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. A similar rule has been extended to all orders of men by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> and to orders of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> (see <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">RELIGIOUS PROFESSION</a>). On the other hand, since the Rescript of the Penitentiary of 1 Dec., 1820, confirmed by the declaration to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 31 July, 1878, the solemn profession of religious in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> (and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> appears to enjoy the same privilege) does not prevent them from acquiring <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> or keeping and administering it, or disposing of it: they are bound, however, in the exercise of their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, to observe the submission they owe to their legitimate superiors.
<h3>The vow of poverty in general</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty may generally be defined as the promise made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of a certain constant renunciation of temporal goods, in order to follow Christ. The object of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty is anything visible, material, appreciable at a money value. Reputation, personal services, and the application of the mass, do not fall under this <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>; <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> are included only on account of the <a href="../cathen/12762a.htm">reliquary</a> which contains them, and (at least in practice) <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, as such, remain the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the religious. The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty entirely forbids the independent use, and sometimes the acquisition or possession of such <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> as falls within its scope. A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has made this <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> gives up the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to acquire, possess, use, or dispose of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> except in accordance with the will of his superior. Nevertheless certain acts of abdication are sometimes left to the discretion of the religious himself, such as the arrangements for the administration and application of income which professed religious under simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are required to make; and the drawing up of a will, by which the religious makes a disposition of his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> to take effect after his death, may be permitted without any restriction. This license with regard to wills is of great antiquity. The simple fact of refusing to accept, for example, a personal legacy, may be contrary to charity, but cannot be an offence against the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty. The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty does not debar a religious from administering an <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">ecclesiastical benefice</a> which is conferred upon him, accepting sums of money to distribute for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> works, or assuming the administration of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> for the benefit of another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> (when this is consistent with his religious state), nor does it in any way forbid the fulfilment of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, whether they are the result of a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> promise &mdash; for the religious may properly engage to offer a Mass or render any personal service &mdash; or arise from a fault, since he is bound in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to repair any wrong done to the reputation of another <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>.

<p>Submission to a superior (as we call the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whose permission, by the terms of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, is required for all acts disposing of temporal goods) does not necessarily call for an express or formal permission. A tacit permission which may be inferred from some act or attitude and the expression of some other wish, or even a reasonable presumption of permission, will be sufficient. There is no violation of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, when the religious can say to himself, "the superior, who is acquainted with the facts, will approve of my acting in this way without being informed of my intention". The case is more difficult, when he knows that the superior would expect to be informed, and asked for permission, even though he would willingly have given his consent: if it seems probable that he regards the request for permission as a condition of his approval, the inferior offends against the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty, if he acts without asking leave; but there is no offence if he knows that the superior and himself are agreed as to the essential nature of the act; and the question whether the presumption is reasonable or otherwise may depend on the customs of different orders, the importance of the object, the frequent necessity of the act, the age and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> of the inferior, his relations with his superior, the facility of obtaining access to him, and other similar considerations. Any admission of luxury or superfluity in daily life is derogatory to the religious state and the first conception of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> poverty; but it is not clear that this want of strictness is necessarily contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. To decide this, regard must be had to the manner in which each particular <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, with all its circumstances, is generally understood.

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty is necessarily an offence against the virtue of religion, and when committed in connexion with <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a> it is even a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilege</a>. It may be a grave or a slight offence. The question, what matter is grave, causes great difficulty to moral <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>; and while some regard the appropriation of one franc as a grave matter, others are more lenient. Most <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> are inclined to compare the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of theft, and say that the same amount which would make theft a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> would, if appropriated contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, constitute a grave offence against poverty. With the exception of Palmieri (Opus morale, tr. IX, c. i, n. 123) and <a href="../cathen/06415c.htm">G&eacute;nicot</a> (Theol. mor., II, n. 98) <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moralists</a> admit that as in the case of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, so here circumstances may be considered. While many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> consider the importance and the wealth or poverty of the community in which the offence is committed, we are of opinion that it is rather the extent of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> that should be considered, since the act does not violate the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> by reason of the harm it causes, but by its being a forbidden appropriation. If the fault is aggravated by in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> it must, as an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> act, be judged according to the usual rules; but when considered as an offence against the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, its gravity will be measured by the condition of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who commits it. Thus a sum which would be very large for a beggar will be insignificant for a man who had belonged to a higher class. The social position should be considered; is it that of the poor or <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant</a> class? One cannot without grave fault dispose independently of a sum which without grave fault one could not take away from a beggar. For many existing congregations, the matter will be that of a mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of theft committed to the detriment of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of honourable condition. It follows that in the case of incomplete appropriation, we must consider the economical value of the act in question; whether, for example, it is an act of simple use of administration; and when the religious does nothing but give away honourably goods of which he retains the ownership, the amount must be very large before the reasonable disposal of it can be regarded as a grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for want of the required authorization. If the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> consists, not in an independent appropriation, but in a life of too great luxury, it will be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to measure the gravity of the fault by the opposition which exists between luxury and the poverty which is promised by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.
<h3>Variety in the vows of poverty</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty is ordinarily attached to a <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">religious profession</a>; a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may however bind himself to a modest and frugal life, or even to follow the direction of an adviser in the use of his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> may be perpetual or temporary. It may exclude private possession, or even to a certain point possession in common. It may entail legal disability or be simply prohibitive. It may extend to all goods possessed at present, or expected in the future; or it may be limited to certain classes of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>; it may require the complete renunciation of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, or simply forbid the application to personal profit, or even the independent use of the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. According to the present <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline of the Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty taken by religious always involves a certain renunciation of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>: thus the religious is understood to give up to his order for ever the fruit of his work or personal industry, stipends of Masses, salary as professor, profits of any publication or invention, or savings from money allowed him for personal expenses. The independent disposal of any of these would be contrary not only to the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, but also to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. We have, moreover, to distinguish in the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> between the solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty and the simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. The latter may be a step towards the solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, or it may have a final character of its own.
<h3>The solemn vow of poverty</h3>

<p>The solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> by <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> has the following special characteristics: it extends to all <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>; it renders one incapable of possessing <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, and therefore of transferring it; it makes all gifts or legacies which a religious receives, as well as the fruits of his own work, the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; and in case <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> is inherited, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> succeeds in place of the professed religious, in accordance with the maxim: <em>Quicquid monachus acquirit monasterio acquirit</em>. Some orders are incapable of inheriting on such occasions, e.g., the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> Observantines, the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. The inheritance then passes to those who would succeed under the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> in default of the professed religious. Sometimes before solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are made by a religious, his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> gives up its right of inheritance by arrangement with the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and sometimes the religious is allowed to dispose of his share in anticipation. (As to these arrangements and their effect, see Vermeersch, "De relig. instit. et pers.", II, 4th ed., supp. VI, 70 sqq.) As long as <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> were independent, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which inherited in place of the professed <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> was the house to which he was bound by his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of stability; but in more recent orders, the religious often changes his house, and sometimes his province, and has therefore no <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of stability, except as to the entire order; in such cases, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> according to the common usage is the whole order, unless some arrangement is made for partition among provinces or houses. (See Sanchez, "In decalogum", VII, xxxii sqq.; <a href="../cathen/09418b.htm">De Lugo</a>, "De institia et iure", d. iii, nn. 226 sqq.) We have already said that the religious of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> preserve their capacity to acquire <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and dispose of it: their acts therefore are valid, but they will only be licit if done with the approval of their superior. It will be the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the latter to see that the rigour of observance and especially the common life do not suffer by this concession, which is, indeed in other respects most important for their own civil security.
<h3>The simple vow of religious poverty</h3>

<p>The simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty has these common characteristics: it leaves the capacity to acquire intact, and permits the religious to retain certain <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of ownership. In exceptional cases the simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> may involve incapacity, as is characteristic of the last simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>. We have now to distinguish between the simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> which is preparatory to the solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, and the final simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>.
<h3 id="A">The simple vow in preparation for the solemn vow</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Sanctissimus" of 12 June, 1858, with the subsequent declarations, constitutes the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> on the subject of this simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. (See Vermeersch, "De religiosis institutis etc.", II, 4th ed., nn. 61 sqq., pp. 178 sqq.) This <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> permits the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> to retain the ownership of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> possessed at the time of his entrance into religion, to acquire <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> by inheritance, and to receive gifts and personal legacies. The administration and usufruct and the use of this <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> must before the taking of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> pass either to the order (if it is able and willing to approve of the arrangement), or into other hands, at the choice of the religious. Such an arrangement is irrevocable as long as the religious remains under the conditions of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, and ceases should he leave the order; he seems authorized also to make or complete the resignation which he may have omitted to make or complete previously. Except so far as he is affected by the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, which forbids <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> to make any renunciation which would interfere with their liberty to leave their order, the religious who is bound by this simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> may, with the permission of his superior, dispose of his <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> by a donation <em>inter vivos</em>, and apparently has full liberty to make a will. But the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Perpensis" of 3 May, 1902, which extends to <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> the simple profession of orders of men, without mentioning a will, declares simply that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are not permitted to make final disposition of their <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> except during the two months immediately preceding their solemn profession.
<h3 id="B">The final simple vow</h3>

<p>With the exception of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, in which the simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of formed coadjutors entails the same personal <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> and the same disability as the solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, the final simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> is known only in religious congregations, and the practice differs in different congregations (cf. Lucidi, "De visitatione SS. liminum" II, v, sec. 8, nn. 319 sqq.), and very often resembles that of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> preparatory to the solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>; but according to the Regulations (<em>Norm&oelig;</em>) of 28 June, 1901, the transfer of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> by donations <em>inter vivos</em> cannot be licitly made before the perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>; after these <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, the complete renunciation requires the permission of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, which reserves to itself also the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to authorize the execution or modification of a will after profession. Any arrangements made before profession for the administration of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and the application of the revenues may be subsequently modified with the consent of the superior. In <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> institutes, there is no question of the capacity of the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> generally reserve to themselves the right of approving the more important acts of administration.
<h3>The <em>Peculium</em></h3>

<p>Certain goods, for example sums of money, independent of the common stock, and made over to the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> to be used without restriction for their private wants, form what is called the peculium. Only that which is irrevocably put out of the power of the superior is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty; but all peculium is an injury to that common life, which since the earliest times was considered so important by the founders of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> constantly uses its efforts to abolish it, and to establish that perfect common life which provides that there shall be in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> one common treasury for the personal needs of all.
<h3>Possession in common</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty does not necessarily or as a general rule exclude the capacity to possess in common, that is to say, to have a common stock of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> at the common disposal of the possessors, provided that they do not dispose of it in any manner Contrary to the accepted rules and customs. It is a great mistake to argue from the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of poverty that it is just to deny to <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> this real common possession.
