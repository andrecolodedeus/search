<h1>Power of the Keys</h1>  

<p>The expression "power of the keys" is derived from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words to <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">St. Peter</a> (in <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs19">Matthew 16:19</a>). The promise there made finds its explanation in <a href="../bible/isa022.htm">Isaiah 22</a>, in which "the key of the house of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>" is conferred upon Eliacim, the son of Helcias, as the symbol of plenary authority in the Kingdom of Juda. Christ by employing this expression clearly designed to signify his intention to confer on St. Peter the supreme authority over His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For a consideration of the text in its dogmatic bearing, see <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">POPE</a>; <a href="../cathen/12423a.htm">PRIMACY</a>. In the present article our sole purpose is to give a brief historical account of the meaning attached to the expression by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers.
<h2 id="section1">The Fathers</h2>

<p>(1) In the Fathers the references to the promise of <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs19">Matthew 16:19</a>, are of frequent occurrence. Almost invariably the words of Christ are cited in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The application is a natural one, for the promise of the keys is immediately followed by the words: "Whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth", etc. Moreover, the power to confer or to withhold forgiveness might well be viewed as the opening and shutting of the gates of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. This interpretation, however, restricts the sense somewhat too narrowly; for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is but one of the various ways in which <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority is exercised. We have examples of this use of the term is such passages as August., "De Doctrina Christi", xvii, xviii: "Quid liberatius et misericordius facere potuit. . .nisi ut omnia donaret conversis. . .Has igitur claves dedit Ecclesiae suae ut quae solveret in terra soluta essent in coelo" (How could He [Christ] have shown greater liberality and greater mercy. . .than by granting full forgiveness to those who should turn from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. . .He gave these keys to His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, therefore, that whatever it should remit on earth should be remitted also in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>) (P.L., XXIV, 25; cf. Hilary, "In Matt.", xvi, P.L., IX, 1010).

<p>It is comparatively seldom that the Fathers, when speaking of the power of the keys, make any reference to the supremacy of St. Peter. When they deal with that question, they ordinarily appeal not to the gift of the keys but to his office as the rock on which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is founded. In their references to the <em>potestas clavium</em>, they are usually intent on vindicating against the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanist</a> and <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> the power inherent in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to forgive. Thus St. Augustine in several passages declares that the authority to bind and loose was not a purely personal gift to St. Peter, but was conferred upon him as representing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The whole Church, he urges, exercises the power of forgiving <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. This could not be had the gift been a personal one (tract. 1 in Joan., n. 12, P.L., XXXV, 1763; Serm. ccxcv, in P.L., XXXVIII, 1349). From these passages certain <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> controversialists have drawn the curious conclusion that the power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> belongs not to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> but to the collective body of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (see Cheetham in "Dict. Christ. Antiq.", s.v.). There is, of course, no suggestion of this meaning. St. Augustine merely signifies that the power to absolve was to be imparted through St. Peter to members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> throughout the world.

<p>Some few of the Fathers, however, are careful to note that the bestowal of this power upon St. Peter alone, apart from the other Apostles, denoted his primacy among the twelve (Optatus, "De Schism. Don.", vii, 3, in P.L., XI, 1087). <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> dilates at length on this point, but teaches <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneously</a> that the power conferred upon the Twelve in <a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs18">Matthew 18:18</a>, could only be exercised within certain restrictions of place, while that conferred upon St. Peter in <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs18">Matthew 16:18</a>, was of universal extent (Comm. in Matt., P.G., XIII, 1179).

<p>(2) Occasionally, though infrequently, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> promise is not restricted to signify the power to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but is taken in the fuller meaning of the gift of authority over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> in his letter to the <a href="../cathen/10069a.htm">Emperor Maurice</a>, after quoting <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words in <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#vrs18">Matthew 16:18-19</a>, writes: "Behold he [Peter] received the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, the power of binding and loosing is committed to him, the care of the whole Church and its government is given to him [cura ei totius Ecclesiae et principatus committitur (Epist., lib. V, ep. xx, in P.L., LXXVII, 745)]. St. Maximus in a sermon on the feast of Saints Peter and Paul (P.L., LVII, 403) says that to St. Peter was given the key of power (<em>clavis potentioe</em>), to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> the key of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (<em>clavis scientioe</em>). The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a key of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is clearly derived from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, <a href="../bible/luk011.htm#vrs52">Luke 11:52</a>: "You have taken away the key of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>." This distinction of the <em>clavis potentioe</em> and <em>clavis scientioe</em> recurs frequently in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> writers, though without reference to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>.
<h2 id="section2">The Scholastics</h2>

<p>By the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> the precise significance of the term was closely <a href="../cathen/01450a.htm">analysed</a>.

<p>(1) The view which is now universally accepted is exposed at length by <a href="../cathen/14319a.htm">Su&aacute;rez</a> (De Poenit., disp. xvi). According to him, the phrase as employed by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in His promise to St. Peter denotes the gift of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority in its widest scope. This authority was to be in a sense peculiar to St. Peter and his successors in the chief pastorate; for they alone were to possess it in its fullness. But it was to be exercised in due measure by the other members of the Divinely instituted <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> according to their several degrees. Thus understood, the <em>potestas clavium</em> includes <ul> <li>the power of order, namely power exercised in regard to sacrifice and sacrament, <li>the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">power of jurisdiction</a>, and <li>the power to define in questions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. </ul>

<p>The various powers thus conferred upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were held to belong either to the <em>clavis potentioe</em> or to the <em>clavis scientioe</em>, the latter of these two being understood to signify the power to teach, while the other departments of authority pertained to the <em>clavis potentioe</em>. The distinction is, however, a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> refinement, and is not involved in the expression itself. As Francisco Su&aacute;rez urges, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when using the plural form, did not intend to indicate that the gift was twofold.

<p>(2) The meaning attached to the term by the older <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> was, however, different from this. They followed the patristic tradition, and confined its significance to the judicial authority exercised in the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>. The power of the keys, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> tells us (<a href="../summa/5017.htm#article2">Summa Theologica Supp:17:2, ad 1um</a>), is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> consequence of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> character. It is, in fact, identical in essence with the power to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> and to offer the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a>. The one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> gift is applied to different ends in the different <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. Such, too, appears to be the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">Pope John XXII</a> in a well-known passage dealing with this subject (Extravag., tit. xiv, De verborum signif., c. v, Quia quorundam). The definition, "Clavis est specialis potestas ligandi et solvendi qua judex ecclesiasticus dignos recipere et indignos excludere debet a regno" (The keys are a special power of binding and loosing by which the <a href="../cathen/08545a.htm">ecclesiastical judge</a> should receive the worthy [into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>] and exclude the unworthy therefrom), generally accepted in the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> period (Pet. Lomb., "Sent.", IV, dist. xviii; <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a>, loc. cit.; St. Thomas, loc. cit.), might seem indeed to include <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> in the external as well as in the internal forum. But in point of fact it was not so understood. The distinction between the <em>clavis potentioe</em> and the <em>clavis scientioe</em> was employed here. By the <em>clavis scientioe</em> was understood the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> authority to interrogate the penitent and thus obtain cognizance of the facts of the case; by the <em>clavis potentioe</em>, the authority to grant or refuse <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a>.

<p>The view just exposed is inadmissible as an interpretation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> words. For it is plain that He desired to confer by them some special prerogative on Peter, while, according to this interpretation, the <em>potestas clavium</em> is common to all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.

<p>(3) Hence there were not wanting <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> who narrowly restricted the scope of the gift, and asserted that it denoted the special prerogatives appertaining to St. Peter and his successors, and these alone. Thus <a href="../cathen/03145c.htm">Cardinal Cajetan</a> (Opusc., I, tract. iii, De Rom. Pont., c. v) held that while the power of binding and loosing belonged to all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the power of the keys &#151; authority to open and shut &#151; was proper to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">supreme pontiff</a>; and that this expression signified his authority to rule the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to define <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>, to legislate, and to dispense from <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. A similar opinion would seem to have been held by the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> whose views are rejected by <a href="../cathen/08431a.htm">John XXII</a> (loc. cit.). They contended that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> held a <em>clavis scientioe</em> and a <em>clavis potentioe</em>; and that, though in the case of the <em>clavis potentioe</em> a decision arrived at might be reversed be a subsequent act, no reversal was possible where the <em>clavis scientioe</em> had been employed.

<p>(4) <a href="../cathen/09491b.htm">Macedo</a> in his treatise "De Clavibus Petri" (Rome, 1660), attributes to certain <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and canonists the opinion that the keys denote the supreme authority in the civil and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> spheres, and that Christ conferred upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> a direct supremacy over both orders. We have, however, been unable to verify this statement. Indeed the writers who attributed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> an indirect authority only, in regard to civil governments, found an argument for their views in this very passage. They pointed out that it was the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and not of the kingdoms of this earth, which Christ bestowed upon His vicar.
