<h1>Praxeas</h1>  

<p>An early anti-Montanist, is known to us only by <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian's</a> book <a href="../fathers/0317.htm">"Adversus Praxean"</a>. His name in the list of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> appended to the "De Praescriptionibus" of that writer (an anonymous epitome of the lost "Syntagma" of <a href="../cathen/07360c.htm">Hippolytus</a>) is a correction made by some ancient <em>diorthotes</em> for Noetus. Praxeas was an <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asiatic</a>, and was inflated with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> (says <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>) as a confessor of the Faith because he had been for a short time in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. He was well received at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (c. 190-98) by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> (Victor, or possibly <a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Zephyrinus</a>). The latter <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> had decided to acknowledge the prophetic gifts of Montanus, Prisca, and Maximilla (if we may believe <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>). The intention had been sufficiently public to bring peace to the Churches of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a> and Phrygia &#151; so much depended on the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sanction; but Praxeas prevailed upon the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> to recall his letter. He came to Carthage before <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> had renounced the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communion (c. 206-8). He taught <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Monarchian</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> there, or at least <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> which <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> regarded as <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Monarchian</a>: "Patrem cruci fixit; Paraclitum fugavit" &#151; "Having driven out the Paraclete [Montanus], he now crucified the Father". He was refuted, evidently by Tertullian himself, and gave an explanation or recantation in writing, which, when <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> wrote several years afterwards, was still in the hands of the authorities of the Carthaginian Church, the carnal", as he affects to call them. When <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> wrote he himself was no longer in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">Monarchianism</a> had sprung up again, but he does not mention its leaders at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and directs his whole argument against his old enemy Praxeas. But the arguments which he refutes are doubtless those of Epigonus and Cleomenes. There is little reason for thinking that Praxeas was a heresiarch, and less for identifying him with Noetus, or one of his disciples. He was very likely merely an adversary of the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> who used some quasi-Monarchian expressions when at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, but afterwards them when he saw they might be misunderstood. On the identification by Hageman of Praxeas with Callistus, see <a href="../cathen/10448a.htm">MONARCHIANS</a>.
