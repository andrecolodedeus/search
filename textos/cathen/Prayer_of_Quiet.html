<h1>Prayer of Quiet</h1>  

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a> of Quiet is regarded by all writers on <a href="../cathen/14621a.htm">mystical theology</a> as one of the degrees of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. It has to be distinguished therefore from meditation and from affective <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. It holds an intermediary place between the latter and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of union. As the name implies the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of quiet is that in which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> experiences an extraordinary peace and rest, accompanied by delight or pleasure in contemplating <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as present. In this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His presence, and makes it feel that it is really in communication with Him, although He does this in a somewhat obscure manner. The manifestation increases in distinctness, as the union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> becomes of a higher order. This mystic gift cannot be acquired, because it is <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself who makes His presence felt in the inmost <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The certain sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> therein obtained is not the same as the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, though it is founded upon <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The gift of wisdom is especially employed in this degree, as it is in every degree of contemplation. According to Scaramelli the office of this gift, at least to a certain extent, is to render <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> present to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and so much the more present as the gift is more abundant. Some authors say that this is not to be understood of the ordinary gift of wisdom which is necessarily connected with <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a> and is possessed by every just man, but of wisdom as one of the <em>charismata</em> or extraordinary <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> of the Holy Ghost, specially granted to privileged <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. <ul><li>At first the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of quiet is given from time to time only and then merely for a few minutes. <li>It takes place when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has already arrived at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of recollection and silence, or what some authors call the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of simplicity. <li>A degree of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not a definite state excluding reversions to former states. <li>A time often comes when the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of quiet is not only very frequent but <em>habitual</em>. In this case it occurs not only at the time set for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, but every time that the thought of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> presents itself. <li>Even then it is subject to interruptions and alterations of intensity, sometimes strong and sometimes weak.</ul>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of quiet does not entirely impede the exercise of the faculties of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The will alone remains captive. The <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and memory appear to have greater activity for the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in this state, but not so much for worldly affairs. They may even escape the bounds of restraint and wander on strange and useless thoughts, and yet the will, attracted by the charm of the Divine presence, continues its delights, not wholly in a passive way, but capable of eliciting fervent affections and aspirations. As to the bodily senses <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a> tells us that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> during the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of quiet can hear and remember things said near them; and, quoting St. Teresa, he observes that it is a type of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> to be so jealous of our repose as to refrain from coughing, and almost from breathing for fear of losing it. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who is the author of this peace will not deprive us of it for unavoidable bodily motions, or even for involuntary wanderings of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. The spiritual fruits are: <ul><li>interior peace which remains after the time of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <li>profound <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, <li>aptitude and a disposition for spiritual <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, <li>a heavenly light in the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and <li>stability of the will in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>.</ul> It is by such fruits <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> mystics may be discerned and distinguished from <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> mystics.
