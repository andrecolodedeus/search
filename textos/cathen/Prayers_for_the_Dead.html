<h1>Prayers for the Dead</h1>  

<p>This subject will be treated under the following three heads:</p>

<ul><li>General statement and proof of Catholic doctrine<li>Questions of detail<li>Practice in the British and Irish Churches</ul>

<h2 id="section1">General statement and proof</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> regarding prayers for the dead is bound up inseparably with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> and the more general <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">communion of the saints</a>, which is an article of the <a href="../cathen/01629a.htm">Apostle's Creed.</a> The definition of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXV), "that purgatory exists, and that the souls detained therein are helped by the suffrages of the faithful, but especially by the acceptable sacrifice of the altar", is merely a restatement in brief of the traditional teaching which had already been embodied in more than one authoritative formula &#151; as in the creed prescribed for converted <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldenses</a> by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> in 1210 (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, Enchiridion, n. 3 73) and more fully in the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> accepted for the Greeks by Michael Palaeologus at the Second Ecumenical <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> in 1439: "[We define] likewise, that if the truly penitent die in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, before they have made satisfaction by worthy fruits of penance for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of commission and omission, their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are purified by <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatorial</a> pains after death; and that for relief from these pains they are benefitted by the suffrages of the faithful in this life, that is, by Masses, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>, and by the other offices of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> usually performed by the faithful for one another according to the practice [<em>instituta</em>] of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>" (ibid., n. 588). Hence, under "suffrages" for the dead, which are defined to be legitimate and efficacious, are included not only formal supplications, but every kind of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> work that may be offered for the spiritual benefit of others, and it is in this comprehensive sense that we speak of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in the present article. As is clear from this general statement, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not recognize the limitation upon which even modern <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> often insist, that prayers for the dead, while legitimate and commendable as a private practice, are to be excluded from her public offices. The most efficacious of all <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a>, is the essentially public office, the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>.

<p>Coming to the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, we find, in the first place, that it is an integral part of the great general <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which we name the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">communion of saints</a>. This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the counterpart in the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> of human solidarity. Men are not isolated units in the life of grace, any more than in domestic and civil life. As children in <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Christ's Kingdom</a> they are as one <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> under the loving Fatherhood of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as members of <a href="../cathen/10663a.htm">Christ's mystical body</a> they are incorporated not only with Him, their common Head, but with one another, and this not merely by visible social bonds and external co-operation, but by the invisible bonds of mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and sympathy, and by effective co-operation in the inner life of grace. Each is in some degree the beneficiary of the spiritual activities of the others, of their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, their merits and satisfactions; nor is this degree to be wholly measured by those indirect ways in which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of solidarity works out in other cases, nor by the conscious and explicit altruistic intentions of individual agents. It is wider than this, and extends to the bounds of the mysterious. Now, as between the living, no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> can deny the reality of this far-reaching spiritual communion; and since death, for those who die in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and grace, does not sever the bonds of this communion, why should it interrupt its efficacy in the case of the dead, and shut them out from benefits of which they are capable and may be in need? Of very few can it be hoped that they have attained perfect <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> at death; and none but the perfectly holy are admitted to the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a>. Of few, on the other hand, will they at least who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them admit the despairing thought that they are beyond the pale of grace and mercy, and condemned to eternal separation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and from all who hope to be with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On this ground alone it has been truly said that <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> is a postulate of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> reason; and, granting the existence of the <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatorial state</a>, it is equally a postulate of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> reason in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">communion of saints</a>, or, in other words, be helped by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of their brethren on earth and in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Christ is King in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> as well as in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and on earth, and He cannot be deaf to our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> ones in that part of His Kingdom, whom he also loves while He chastises them. For our own consolation as well as for theirs we want to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in this living intercourse of charity with our dead. We would believe it without explicit warrant of Revelation, on the strength of what is otherwise revealed and in obedience to the promptings of reason and natural affection. Indeed, it is largely for this reason that <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in growing numbers are giving up today the joy-killing <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, and reviving <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> and practice. As we shall presently see, there is no clear and explicit warrant for prayers for the dead in the Scriptures recognized by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> as canonical, while they do not admit the Divine authority of extra-Scriptural traditions. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are in a better position.


<h3 id="A">Arguments from Scripture</h3>

<p>Omitting some passages in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> which are sometimes invoked, but which are too vague and uncertain in their reference to be urged in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> (v.g. Tobias, iv, 18; <a href="../bible/sir007.htm#vrs37">Sirach 7:37</a>; etc.), it is enough to notice here the classical passage in II Machabees, xii, 40-46. When <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> and his men came to take away for burial the bodies of their brethren who had fallen in the battle against Gorgias, "they found under the coats of the slain some of the donaries of the idols of Jamnia, which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> forbiddeth to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: so that all plainly saw, that for this cause they were slain. Then they all blessed the just judgment of the Lord, who had discovered the things that were hidden. And so betaking themselves to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, they besought him, that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which had been committed might be forgotten...And making a gathering, he [<a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>] sent twelve [al. two] drachms of silver to Jerusalem for sacrifice to be offered for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the dead, thinking well and religiously concerning the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> (for if he had not hoped that they that were slain should rise again, it would have seemed superfluous and vain to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the dead), and because he considered that they who had fallen asleep in godliness, had great grace laid up for them. It is therefore a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and wholesome thought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the dead, that they may be loosed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." For <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who accept this book as canonical, this passage leaves nothing to be desired. The inspired author expressly approves <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas's</a> action in this particular case, and recommends in general terms the practice of prayers for the dead. There is no contradiction in the particular case between the conviction that a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had been committed, calling down the penalty of death, and the hope that the sinners had nevertheless died in godliness &#151; an opportunity for penance had intervened.

<p>But even for those who deny the inspired authority of this book, unequivocal evidence is here furnished of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and practice of the Jewish Church in the second century B.C. &#151; that is to say, of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Church, for the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a> denied the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> (and, by implication at least, the general <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>), and it would seem from the argument of which the author introduces in his narrative that he had Sadducean adversaries in mind. The act of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a> and his men in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for their deceased comrades is represented as if it were a matter of course; nor is there anything to suggest that the procuring of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for the dead was a novel or exceptional thing; from which it is fair to conclude that the practice &#151; both private and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> &#151; goes back beyond the time of <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, but how far we cannot say. It is reasonable also to assume, in the absence of positive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> to the contrary, that this practice was maintained in later times, and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and the Apostles were familiar with it; and whatever other evidence is available from Talmudic and other sources strongly confirms this assumption, if it does not absolutely prove it as a fact (see, v.g., Luckock, "After Death", v, pp. 50 sq.). This is worth noting because it helps us to understand the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> significance of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> silence on the subject &#151; if it be held on the incomplete evidence of the Gospels that He was indeed altogether silent &#151; and justifies us in regarding the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> practice as an inheritance from <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>.

<p>We have said that there is no clear and explicit Scriptural text in favour of prayers for the dead, except the above text of II Machabees. Yet there are one or two sayings of Christ recorded by the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>, which are most naturally interpreted as containing an implicit reference to a <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatorial state</a> after death; and in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> a passage of similar import occurs, and one or two other passages that bear directly on the question of prayers for the dead. When Christ promises forgiveness for all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that a man may commit except the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the Holy Ghost, which "shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world nor in the world to come" (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#vrs31">Matthew 12:31-32</a>), is the concluding phrase nothing more than a periphrastic equivalent for "never"? Or, if Christ meant to emphasize the distinction of worlds, is "the world to come" to be understood, not of the life after death, but of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> age on earth as imagined and expected by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? Both interpretations have been proposed; but the second is far-fetched and decidedly improbable (cf. <a href="../bible/mar003.htm#vrs29">Mark 3:29</a>); while the first, though admissible, is less obvious and less natural than that which allows the implied question at least to remain: May <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be forgiven in the world to come? <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> hearers believed in this possibility, and, had He Himself wished to deny it, He would hardly have used a form of expression which they would naturally take to be a tacit admission of their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. Precisely the same argument applies to the words of Christ regarding the debtor who is cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, from which he shall not go out till he has paid the last farthing (<a href="../bible/luk012.htm#vrs59">Luke 12:59</a>).

<p>Passing over the well-known passage, <a href="../bible/1co003.htm#vrs14">1 Corinthians 3:14 sq.</a>, on which an argument for <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> may be based, attention may be called to another curious text in the same Epistle (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs29">15:29</a>), where <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> argues thus in favour of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>: "Otherwise what shall they do that are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> for the dead, if the dead rise not again at all? Why are they then <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> form them?" Even assuming that the practice here referred to was <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitious</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> merely uses it as the basis of an <em>argumentum ad hominem</em>, the passage at least furnishes historical evidence of the prevalence at the time of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the efficacy of works for the dead; and the Apostle's reserve in not reprobating this particular practice is more readily intelligible if we suppose him to have recognized the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the principle of which it was merely an abuse. But it is probable that the practice in question was something in itself legitimate, and to which the Apostle gives his tacit <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>. In his <a href="../cathen/14727b.htm">Second Epistle to Timothy</a> (<a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#vrs16">1:16-18</a>; <a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs19">4:19</a>) <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> speaks of Onesiphorus in a way that seems obviously to imply that the latter was already dead: "The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus" &#151; as to a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in need of consolation. Then, after mention of loyal services rendered by him to the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> Apostle at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, comes the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for Onesiphorus himself, "The Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day" (the day of judgment); finally, in the salutation, "the household of Onesiphorus" is mentioned once more, without mention of the man himself. The question is, what had become of him? Was he dead, as one would naturally infer from what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> writes? Or had he for any other cause become separated permanently from his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, so that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for them should take account of present needs while <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for him looked forward to the day of judgment? Or could it be that he was still at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> when the Apostle wrote, or gone elsewhere for a prolonged absence from home? The first is by far the easiest and most natural hypothesis; and if it be admitted, we have here an instance of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostle</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a deceased benefactor.
<h3 id="B">Arguments from Tradition</h3>

<p>The traditional evidence in favour of prayers for the dead, which has been preserved <ul><li>in monumental inscriptions (especially those of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>), <li>in the ancient <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a>, and <li>in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> literature generally, is so abundant that we cannot do more in this article than touch very briefly on a few of the more important testimonies. </ul> <em>1. Monumental inscriptions</em> The inscriptions in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Roman Catacombs</a> range in date from the first century (the earliest dated is from A.D. 71) to the early part of the fifth; and though the majority are undated, archaeologists have been able to fix approximately the dates of a great many by comparison with those that are <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a>. The greater number of the several thousand extant belong to the ante-Nicene period &#151; the first three centuries and the early part of the fourth. <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">Christian sepulchral inscriptions</a> from other parts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are few in number compared with those in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>, but the witness of such as have come down to us agrees with that of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>. Many inscriptions are exceedingly brief and simple (PAX, IN PACE, etc.), and might be taken for statements rather than <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, were it not that in other cases they are so frequently and so naturally amplified into <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> (PAX TIBI, etc.). There are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, called <em>acclamatory</em>, which are considered to be the most ancient, and in which there is the simple expression of a wish for some benefit to the deceased, without any formal address to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The benefits most frequently <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for are: peace, the good (i.e. <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>), light, refreshment, life, eternal life, union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with Christ, and with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> &#151; e.g. PAX (TIBI, VOBIS, SPIRITUI TUO, IN &AElig;TERNUM, TIBI CUM ANGELIS, CUM SANCTIS); SPIRITUS TUUS IN BONO (SIT, VIVAT, QUIESCAT); &AElig;TERNA LUX TIBI; IN REFREGERIO ESTO; SPIRITUM IN REFRIGERIUM SUSCIPIAT DOMINUS; DEUS TIBI REFRIGERET; VIVAS, VIVATIS (IN DEO, IN [<em>Chi-Rho</em>] IN SPIRITO SANCTO, IN PACE, IN &AElig;TERNO, INTER SANCTOS, CUM MARTYRIBUS). For detailed references see Kirsch, "Die Acclamationen", pp. 9-29; Cabrol and Leclercq, "Monumenta Liturgica" (Paris, 1902), I, pp. ci-cvi, cxxxix, etc. Again there are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of a formal character, in which survivors address their petitions directly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God the Father</a>, or to Christ, or even to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> collectively, or to some one of them in particular. The benefits <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for are those already mentioned, with the addition sometimes of liberation from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Some of these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> read like excepts from the liturgy: e.g. SET PATER OMNIPOTENS, ORO, MISERERE LABORUM TANTORUM, MISERE(re) ANIMAE NON DIG(<em>na</em>) FERENTIS (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, Inscript. Christ., II a, p. ix). Sometimes the writers of the epitaphs request visitors to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the deceased: e.g. QUI LEGIS, ORA PRO EO (Corpus Inscript. Lat., X, n. 3312), and sometimes again the dead themselves ask for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, as in the well-known Greek epitaph of Abercius (see <a href="../cathen/01040a.htm">INSCRIPTION OF ABERCIUS</a>), in two similar Roman epitaphs dating form the middle of the second century (<a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, op. cit., II, a, p. xxx, Kirsch, op. cit., p. 51), and in many later inscriptions. That <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> people often visited the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the dead, and sometimes even inscribed a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> on the monument, is also clear form a variety of indications (see examples in <a href="../cathen/04739c.htm">De Rossi</a>, "Roma Sotteranea", II, p. 15). In a word, so overwhelming is the witness of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> monuments in favour of prayer for the dead that no historian any longer denies that the practice and the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> which the practice implies were universal in the primitive Church. There was no break of continuity in this respect between <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.

<p><em>2. Ancient liturgies</em>

<p>The testimony of the early <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> is in harmony with that of the monuments. Without touching the subject of the various <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> we possess, without even enumerating and citing them singly, it is enough to say here that all without exception &#151; <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and <a href="../cathen/10489b.htm">Monophysite</a> as well as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, those in Syriac, <a href="../cathen/01736b.htm">Armenian</a>, and Coptic as well as those in Greek and Latin &#151; contain the commemoration of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> departed in the Mass, with a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for peace, light, refreshment and the like, and in many cases expressly for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and the effacement of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> stains. The following, from the Syriac <a href="../fathers/0717.htm">Liturgy of St. James</a>, may be quoted as a typical example: "we commemorate all the faithful dead who have died in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>...We ask, we entreat, we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ our God</a>, who took their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and spirits to Himself, that by His many compassions He will make them worthy of the pardon of their faults and the remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>" (Syr. Lit. S. Jacobi, ed. Hammond, p. 75).

<p><em>3. Early Christian literature</em>

<p>Turning finally to early literary sources, we find evidence in the <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> "Acta Joannis", composed about A.D. 160-170, that at that time anniversaries of the dead were commemorated by the application of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the Mass</a> (Lipsius and Bonnet, "Acta Apost. Apocr.", I, 186). The same fact is witnessed by the "Canons of Hippolytus" (Ed. Achelis, p. 106), by <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (De Cor. Mil., iii, P.L., II, 79), and by many later writers. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> also testifies to the regularity of the practice of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> privately for the dead (De Monogam., x, P.L., II, 942); and of the host of later authorities that may be cited, both for public and private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, we must be content to refer to but a few. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> writes to <a href="../cathen/04375c.htm">Cornelius</a> that their mutual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and good offices ought to be continued after either should be called away by death (Ep. lvii, P.L., III, 830 sq.), and he tells us that before his time (d. 258) the African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had forbidden testators to nominate a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> as executor and guardian in their wills, and had decreed, as the penalty for violating this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, deprivation after death of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> and the other offices of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which were regularly celebrated for the repose of each of the faithful; hence, in the case of one Victor who had broken the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, "no offering might be made for his repose, or any <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> offered in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in his name" (Ep. lxvi, P.L., IV, 399). Arnobius speaks of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> churches as "conventicles in which...peace and pardon is asked for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>...for those still living and for those already freed from the bondage of the body" (Adv. Gent., IV, xxxvi, P.L., V, 1076). In his funeral oration for his brother Satyrus <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> beseeches <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to accept propitiously his "brotherly service of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> sacrifice" (fraternum munus, sacrificium sacerdotis) for the deceased ("De Excessu Satyri fr.", I, 80, P.L., XVI, 1315); and, addressing Valentinian and <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a>, he assures them of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> if his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> shall be of any avail; he will let no day or night go past without remembering them in his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and at the altar ("De Obitu Valent.", 78, ibid., 1381). As a further testimony from the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> we may quote one of the many passages in which .htm-->St. Augustine speaks of prayers for the dead: "The universal Church observes this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, handed down from the Fathers, that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> should be offered for those who have died in the communion of the Body and Blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when they are commemorated in their proper place at the Sacrifice" (Serm. clxxii, 2, P.L., XXXVIII, 936). As evidence of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05230a.htm">Eastern Church</a> we may refer to what <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> tells us, that at the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of Constantine "a vast crowd of people together with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> offered their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the Emperor's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with tears and great lamentation" (<a href="../fathers/25024.htm"><em>Life of Constantine</em> IV.71</a>). Acrius, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, who flourished in the third quarter of the fourth century, was branded as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> for denying the legitimacy and efficacy of prayers for the dead. <a href="../cathen/13393b.htm">St. Epiphanius</a>, who records and refutes his views, represent the custom of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for the dead as a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> imposed by tradition (Adv. Haer., III, lxxx, P.G., XLII, 504 sq.), and <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">St. Chrysostom</a> does not hesitate to speak of it as a "law laid down by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>" (Hom., iii, in Philipp., i, 4, P.G., LXII, 203).
<h3>Objections alleged</h3>

<p>No rational difficulty can be urged against the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> of prayers for the dead; on the contrary, as we have seen, the rational presumption in its favour is strong enough to induce <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in it on the part of many whose <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a> does to allow them to prove with entire <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that it is a <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>. Old-time <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> objections, based on certain texts of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and on the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of Dives and Lazarus in the New, are admitted by modern commentators to be either irrelevant or devoid of force.

<p>The saying of Ecclesiastes (xi, 3) for instance, "if the tree fall to the south, or to the north, in what place soever it shall fall, there shall it be", is probably intended merely to illustrate the general theme with which the writer is detailing in the context, viz. the inevitableness of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> in the present visible world. But even if it be understood of the fate of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> after death, it can mean nothing more than what <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> affirms, that the final issue &#151; <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> or damnation &#151; is determined irrevocably at death; which is not incompatible with a temporary state of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatorial</a> purification for the saved.

<p>The imagery of the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of Lazarus is too uncertain to be made the basis of dogmatic inference, except as regards the general <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of rewards and punishments after death; but in any case it teaches merely that one individual may be admitted to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> immediately after death while another may be cast into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, without hinting anything as to the proximate fate of the man who is neither a Lazarus nor a Dives.
<h2 id="section2">Questions of detail</h2>

<p>Admitting the general teaching that prayers for the dead are efficacious, we are naturally led on to inquire more particularly: <ul><li>What <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are efficacious? <li>For whom and how far are they efficacious? <li>How are we, theoretically, to conceive and explain their efficacy? <li>What disciplinary <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> has the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> imposed regarding her public offices for the dead?</ul>

<p>We shall state briefly what is needful to be said in answer to these questions, mindful of the admonition of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, to avoid in this matter those "more difficult and subtle questions that do not make for edification" (Sess. XXV).
<h3 id="A">What prayers are efficacious?</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a> has always occupied the foremost place among prayers for the dead, as will be seen from the testimonies quoted above; but in addition to the Mass and to private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, we have mention in the earliest times of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>, especially in connection with funeral <em>agapae</em>, and of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> for the dead (Kirsch, Die Lehre von der Gemeinschaft der Heiligen, etc., p. 171; Cabrol, Dictionnaire d'archeologie, I, 808-830). Believing in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">communion of saints</a> in which the departed faithful shared, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> saw no reason for excluding them from any of the offices of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> which the living were in the habit of performing for one another. The only development to be noted in this connection is the application of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> for the dead. <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> for the living were a development from the ancient penitential discipline, and were in use for a considerable time before we have any evidence of their being formally applied for the dead. The earliest instance comes from the year 1457. Without entering into the subject here, we would remark that the application of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> for the dead, when properly understood and explained, introduces no new principle, but is merely an extension of the general principle underlying the ordinary practice of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> for the dead. The church claims no power of <em>absolving</em> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> from their pains, as on earth she absolves men from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. It is only <em>per modum suffragii</em>, i.e. by way of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">Indulgences</a> avail for the dead, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> adding her official or corporate intercession to that of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who performs and offers the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgenced</a> work, and beseeching <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to apply, for the relief of those <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> whom the offerer intends, some portion of the superabundant satisfactions of Christ and His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, or, in view of those same satisfactions, to remit some portion of their pains, in what measure may seem good to His own <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> mercy and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.
<h3 id="B">For whom and how far are they efficacious?</h3>

<p>To those who die in wilful, unrepented mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which implies a deliberate turning away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the last end and ultimate good of man, <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> holds out no hope of eventual <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by a course of probation after death. Eternal exile from the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is, by their own choice, the fate of such unhappy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are unavailing to reverse that awful doom. This was the explicit teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the meek and merciful Saviour, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can but repeat the Master's teaching (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">HELL</a>). But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not presume to judge <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>, even those for whom, on other grounds, she refuses to offer her Sacrifice and her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> [see below, (4)], while it may happen, on the contrary, that some of those for whom her oblations are made are among the number of the damned. What of such <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>? If they cannot avail to the ultimate <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the damned, may it at least be held that they are not entirely unavailing to procure some alleviation of their sufferings, some temporary <em>refrigeria</em>, or moments of mitigation, as a few Fathers and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> have suggested? All that can be said in favour of this speculation is, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has never formally reprobated it. But the great majority of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, following <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (In Sent. IV, xlv, q. ii, a. 2), consider it rash and unfounded. If certain words in the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> of the Mass for the Dead, "Lord Jesus Christ, deliver the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of all the faithful departed from the pains of hell, and the deep abyss", seem originally to have suggested an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of deliverance from the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of the damned, this is to be understood not of rescue, but of preservation from that calamity. The whole requiem Office is intensely dramatic, and in this particular <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> suppliant is figured as accompanying the departed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into the presence of its Judge, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, ere yet sentence is pronounced, for its deliverance from the sinner's doom. On the other hand, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are needless for the blessed who already enjoy the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">vision of God</a> face to face. Hence in the Early Church, as St. Augustine expressly assures us (Serm. cclxxv, 5, P.L., XXXVIII, 1295), and as is otherwise abundantly clear, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were not offered <em>for</em> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, but <em>to</em> them, to obtain the benefit of their intercession, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> being considered an act of perfect charity and winning as such an immediate entrance into glory. And the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>: they no longer need the aid of our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> on earth. It is only, then, for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> that our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are really beneficial. But we do not and cannot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the exact degree in which benefits actually accrue to them, collectively or individually. The distribution of the fruits of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">communion of saints</a> among the dead, as among the living, rests ultimately in the hands of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is one of the secrets of His economy. We cannot <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that it is His will that we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> not only for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> collectively, but individually with whom we have been bound on earth by special personal ties. Nor can we <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the general efficacy of our rightly disposed <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for our specially chosen ones as well as for those whom we leave it to Him to choose. This is sufficient to inspire and to guide us in our offices of charity and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> towards the dead; we may confidently commit the application of their fruits to the wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.
<h3 id="C">How are we, theoretically, to conceive and explain their efficacy?</h3>

<p>For a theoretical statement of the manner in which prayers for the dead are efficacious we must refer to the articles <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">MERIT</a> and SATISFACTION, in which the distinction between these terms and their technical meanings will be explained. Since merit, in the strict sense, and satisfaction, as inseparable from merit, are confined to this life, it cannot be said in the strict sense that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> merit or satisfy by their own personal acts. But the purifying and expiatory value of their discipline of suffering, technically called <em>satispassio</em>, is often spoken of in a loose sense as satisfaction. Speaking of satisfaction in the rigorous sense, the living can offer to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by impetration move Him graciously to accept, the satisfactory value of their own <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, or in view of it to remit some part of their discipline; in this sense we may be said to satisfy for the dead. But in order that the personal works of the living may have any satisfactory value, the agents must be in the state of grace. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the just are on this account more efficacious in assisting the dead than the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of those in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, though it does not follow that the general impetratory efficacy is altogether destroyed by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may hear the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of a sinner for others as well as for the supplicant himself. The <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a>, however, retains its essential efficacy in spite of the sinfulness of the minister; ad the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in lesser degree, of the other <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and offices offered by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> in her name.
<h3 id="D">Church laws regarding public offices for the dead</h3>

<p>There is no restriction by Divine or ecclesiastical law as to those of the dead for whom private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> may be offered &#151; except that they may not be offered formally either for the blessed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> or for the damned. Not only for the faithful who have died in external communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but for deceased non-Catholics, even the unbaptized, who may have died in the state of grace, one is free to offer his personal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>; nor does the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> prohibition of her public offices for those who have died out of external communion with her affect the strictly personal element in her minister's acts. For all such she prohibits the <em>public offering</em> of the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Mass</a> (and of other <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> offices); but <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> commonly teach that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is not forbidden to offer the Mass <em>in private</em> for the repose of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of any one who, judging by probable evidence, may be presumed to have died in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and grace, provided, at least, he does not say the special requiem Mass with the special <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in which the deceased is named, since this would give the offering a public and official character. This prohibition does not extend to <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> who have died without being able to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> (see, v.g., Lehmkuhl, "Theol. Moralis", II, n. 175 sq.). For other cases in which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> refuses her public offices for the dead, the reader is referred to the article <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">CHRISTIAN BURIAL</a>. (<em>See also</em> <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">MASS</a>; <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">INDULGENCE</a>; <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">PURGATORY</a>.)
<h2 id="section3">Practice in the British and Irish Churches</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of our forefathers in the efficacy of prayers for the dead is most strikingly shown by the liturgy and ritual, in particular by the collects at Mass and by the burial service. See, for instance, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in the Bobbio <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, the Durham Ritual, Leofric's <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, the Salisbury Rite, the Stowe <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, etc. But it should also be noted that this <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> was clearly formulated, and that is was expressed by the people at large in numerous practices and customs. Thus, <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">Venerable Bede</a> declares that "some who for their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> have been preordained to the lot of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, but whom because of some bad deeds stained with which they went forth out of the body, are after death seized upon by the flames of the <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatorial fire</a>, to be severely chastised, and either are being cleansed until the day of judgment from the filth of their vices by this long trial, or, being set free from punishment by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, the alms-deeds, the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, the tears of faithful friends, they enter, undoubtedly before that time, into the rest of the blessed" (Homily xlix, ed. Mart&egrave;ne, Thes. Aneed., p. 326).

<p>The Council of Calcuth (816) <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> that at a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> death the bell of every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church should call the people together to sing thirty Psalms for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the departed (Wilkins, Concilia, I, 171.). In the <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a> of Leofric (d. 1072) are found special <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> varying according t the condition and sex of the departed. <a href="../cathen/14571a.htm">Archbishop Theodore</a> (d. 690), in the penitential ascribed to him, and <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">St. Dunstan</a> (d. 988), in his "Concordia", explain at length the commemoration of the departed on the third, seventh, and thirtieth day after death. The month's mind (<em>moneth's mynde</em>) in that age signified constant prayer for the dead person during the whole month following his decease. In every church was kept a "Book of Life", or register of those to be <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for, and it was read at the <a href="../cathen/11217a.htm">Offertory</a> of the Mass. This catalogue was also known as the "bead-roll" and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> as "bidding the beads". The "death-bill" was a list of the dead which was sent around at stated times from one <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to another as a reminder of the agreement to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the departed fellow-members. These rolls were sometimes richly illustrated, and in passing from one religious house to another they were filled in with verses in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the deceased. The <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> also were united in the fellowship or prayer for the dead through the guilds, which were organized in every <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. These associations enjoined upon their members various <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> in behalf of the departed, such as taking part in the burial services, offering the Mass-penny, and giving assistance to the alms-folks, who were summoned at least twice a day to bid their beads at church for the departed fellows of the guild. Among other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> for the dead may be mentioned: the "soul-shot", a donation of money to the church at which the funeral service took place, the "doles", i.e. <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> distributed to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, the sick, and the aged for the benefit of a friend's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; the founding of chantries for the support of one or more <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who were to offer Mass daily for the founder's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and the "certain", a smaller endowment which secured for the donor's special benefit the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> usually said by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> for all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> departed. The <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> were often the recipients of benefactions, e.g. to their <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, the terms of which included <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the donor's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and these <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> are set down in the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a>. These various forms of charity were practised not only by the common people but also, and on a very generous scale, by the nobility and royalty. Besides the bequests they made, they often provided in their will for granting freedom to a certain number of bondmen, and left lands to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on condition that the anniversary of their death should be kept by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and the celebration of Masses. For a more complete account see <a href="../cathen/09270c.htm">Lingard</a>, "History and Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church", ch. ix; and Rock, "The Church of Our Fathers" (London, 1852), II, III.

<p>Strange as it must seem to any one acquainted with the history of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, various attempts have been made to prove that in the early <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Church the practice of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for the dead was unknown. Notable among these is Ussher's "Discourse of the Religion anciently professed by the Irish and British" (1631; Vol. IV of "Complete Works", Dublin, 1864). Cf. Killen, "The Ecclesiastical History of Ireland" (London, 1875), I; and Cathcart, "The Ancient British and Irish Churches" (London, 1894). The weakness of Ussher's argument has been shown by several <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> writers, e.g. <a href="../cathen/16051a.htm">Lanigan</a>, "Ecclesiastical History of Ireland" (Dublin, 864), appendix. More careful study has convinced competent non-Catholic writers also that "to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the dead was a recognized custom in the ancient Celtic as in every other portion of the primitive Church" (Warren, The Liturgy and Ritual of the Celtic Church, Oxford, 1881). This statement is borne out by various documents. The Synod of <a href="../cathen/11554a.htm">St. Patrick</a> ("Synodus alia S. Patricii" in Wilkins, "Concilia") declares, ch. vii: "Hear the Apostle saying: "there is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unto death; I do not say that for it any one do <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>". And the Lord: "Do not give the holy to dogs". For he who did not deserve to receive the Sacrifice during life, how can it help him after his death?" The reference to the custom of offering Mass for the departed is obvious; the synod discriminates between those who had observed, and those who had neglected, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> concerning the reception of the Eucharist.

<p>Still more explicit is the declaration found in the ancient collection of canons known as the "Hibernensis" (seventh or eighth century): "Now the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> offers to the Lord in many ways; firstly, for herself, secondly for the Commemoration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> who says "Do this for a commemoration of me", and thirdly, for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the departed" (Bk. II, ch. ix; Wasserschleben, "Die irische Kononensammlung", 2nd. ed., Leipzig, 1885). In the fifteenth book of the "Hibernensis", entitled "On Care for the Dead", there is a first chapter "On the four ways in which the living assist the dead". Quoting from <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, it is said that "the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the departed are released in four ways: by the oblations of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of Saints, by the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> of friends". There follow eight chapters entitled: (2) On those for whom we should offer; (3) On sacrificing for the dead; (4) On prayer for the dead; (5) On <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> for the dead; (6) On <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a> for the dead; (7) On the value of a redeemed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; (8) On not seeking remission after death when it has not been sought for in life; (9) On the care of those who have been snatched away by sudden death (Wasserschleben, op. cit.). Each of these chapters cites passages from the Fathers &#151; Augustine, <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, Jerome &#151; thus showing that the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> maintained the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and practice of the Early Church. that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were to be offered only for those who died in the Faith is evident from certain prescriptions in St. Cummian's Penitential according to which a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was not to be obeyed if he commanded a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> to sing Mass for deceased <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; likewise, if it befell a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> singing Mass that another, in reciting the names of the dead, included <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> departed, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, on becoming aware of this was to perform a week's penance. In the Leabhar Breae, various practices on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> departed are commended. "There is nothing which one does on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of him who has died that doth not help it, both <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> on knees, and abstinence and singing requiems and frequent <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a>. Some are bound to do penance for their deceased <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>." (Whitley Stokes, Introd. to "Vita Tripartita"). It is not, then, surprising that the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Culdees of the eighth century has as part of their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to offer "intercessions, in the shape of <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a>, on behalf of the living and the dead" (Rule of the Culdees, ed. Reeves, Dublin, 1864, p. 242). The old <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a> (Senchus Mor, A.D. 438-441) provided that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should offer <em>requiem</em> for all tenants of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> lands. But no such enactments were needed to stir up individual <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>.

<p>Devotion to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> departed is a characteristic that one meets continually in the lives of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. In the life of <a href="../cathen/08201c.htm">St. Ita</a>, written about the middle of the seventh century, it is related that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of her uncle was released from <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a> through her earnest <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and the charity which, at her instance, his eight sons bestowed (Colgan, Acta SS. Hiberniae, pp. 69-70).

<p>St. Pulcherius (Mochoemog), in the seventh century, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for the repose of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Ronan, a chieftain of Ele, and recommended the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> to do likewise. In the life of <a href="../cathen/02758c.htm">St. Brendan</a>, quoted, singularly enough, by Ussher, we read, "that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the living doth profit much the dead." In the "Acta S. Brendani", edited by <a href="../cathen/14366a.htm">Cardinal Moran</a>, the following <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is given (p. 39): <blockquote> Vouchsafe to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of my <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father and mother</a>, my brothers, sisters, and relations, and of my friends, enemies and benefactors, living and dead, remission of all their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and particularly those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> for whom I have undertaken to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. </blockquote>

<p>At the death of St. Columbanus (615), his disciple, St. Gall, said: After this night's watch, I understood by a vision that my master and father, Columbanus, today departed out of the miseries of this life into the joys of <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a>. For his repose, therefore, the sacrifice of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> ought to be offered; and "at a signal from the bell [the brethren] entered the oratory, prostrated themselves in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and began to say masses and to offer earnest petitions in commemoration of the blessed Columbanus" (Walafrid Strabo, Vita B. Galli, I, Cap. xxvi). Cathcart (op. cit., 332) cites only the words narrating the vision, and says: "they show conclusively that <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> was the immediate home after death of all the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Great Britain and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>." But the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for the dead was a traditional part of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. Thus, when St. Gall himself died, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who was his intimate friend offered the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> for him &#151; "pro carissimo salutares hostias immolavit amico" (ibid., ch. xxx). The same is recorded of St. Columba when he learned of the death of Columbanus of Leinster (<a href="../cathen/01135c.htm">Adamnan</a>, Vita S. Col., III, 12). These facts are the more significant because they show that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were offered even for those who had been models of holy living. Other evidences are furnished in donations to <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, ancient inscriptions on gravestones, and the requests for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> with which the writers of <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> closed their volumes. These and the like <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> practices were after all but other means of expressing what the faithful heard day by day at the memento for the dead in the Mass, when <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was offered for those "who have gone before us with the sign of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and rest in the sleep of peace" (Stowe <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>). (See Salmon, "The Ancient Irish Church", Dublin, 1897; Bellesheim, "Gesch. d. katholischen Kirche in Irland", Mainz, 1890, I, and bibliography there given.)
