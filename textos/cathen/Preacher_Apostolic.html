<h1>Preacher Apostolic</h1>  

<p>A dignitary of the pontifical household. As a regular function, under special Regulations, this office was established by <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>, in 1555, and formed a part of the great scheme of reforms which that <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> was anxious to carry out. The innovation was somewhat unpopular among the Prelates, as the preacher Apostolic bad to expound wholesome <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> before the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Court, and remind them of their respective <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. Before 1555 several members of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, especially of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, had preached in presence of the Roman Court. In the period following, among those who filled the office of preacher Apostolic were Alonso Salmer&oacute;n, companion of <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">Saint Ignatius</a>, Francis Toleto, S.J., who held the position during seven Pontificates, Anselmus Marzatti, Francis Cassini, and Bonaventure Barberini, Minor <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>; Toleto, Marzatti, and Cassini were elevated to the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinalate</a>. By the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 2 March, 1753, directed to Father Michael Angelo Franceschi, then preacher Apostolic, Benedict XIV conferred the said dignity <em>in perpetuum</em> upon the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Order</a>, because of &quot;the example of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and religious perfection, the splendour of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and the Apostolic <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>&quot; to be found in their institute. Two of the preachers Apostolic during the past century deserve special mention: Lewis Micara of <a href="../cathen/06243a.htm">Frascati</a>, who became Cardinal-Vicar of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and Lewis of <a href="../cathen/15035a.htm">Trent</a>, chosen to deliver the discourse at the first session of the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. At present the office is held by Father Luke of Padua, the former titular, Father Pacific of Sejano, having been elected Minister General of the order. The preacher is chosen by the pontiff, though generally presented by the predecessor, or by the superior general of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. He is notified by a <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">Rescript</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of the Apostolic Palace; and becomes <em>ipso facto</em> a Palatine <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> and a member of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> household, enjoying all the privileges attached to his title. The sermons are delivered in <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> on the Feasts of St. Andrew, <a href="../cathen/11063b.htm">St. Nicholas</a>, St. Lucy, and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>; and on Fridays in <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, except in <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>, when the Passion Sermon is preached on Tuesday. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> Court meets in the throne-room in the Vatican; the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> occupies the place of the throne. Beside it is placed the <em>bussola</em>, a perforated wooden partition, covered with silver hangings, behind which is the seat of the pontiff. On the appointed day, the preacher with his &quot; socius &quot; is taken to the Vatican in a pontifical carriage, and enters the throne-room; when notified by the master of ceremonies, he draws near the <em>bussola</em>, takes off his mantle, asks the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> blessing, and ascends the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a>. The sermon begins with an &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, recited aloud and answered by the audience. The pontiff is assisted by his majordomo and the master of the camera. The <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> occupy the front seats: behind them are the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, and general heads of the Mendicant Orders. Nobody else is admitted without a special permission of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. At the close of the sermon, the preacher returns to the pontiff, <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kisses</a> his feet, takes leave of him, and is driven back to his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>.
