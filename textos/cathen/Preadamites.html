<h1>Preadamites</h1>  

<p>The supposed inhabitants of the earth prior to Adam. Strictly speaking, the expression ought to be limited to denote men who had perished before the creation of Adam; but commonly even Coadamites are called Preadamites, provided they spring from a stock older than Adam. The question whether we can admit the existence of Preadamites in the strict sense of the word, i.e. the existence of a <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">human race</a> (or human races) extinct before the time of Adam or before the Divine action described in <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#vrs2">Genesis 1:2 sqq.</a>, is as little connected with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> as the question whether one or more of the stars are inhabited by rational beings resembling man. Palmieri ("De Creatione", <a href="../cathen/12117a.htm">Prato</a>, 1910, p. 281, thes. xxx) does not place any <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> censure on the opinion maintaining the past existence of such Preadamites, and Fabre d'Envieu ("Les Origines de la terre et de l'homme", Paris, 1873, lib. XI, prop. 1) defends the theory as probable. But the case is quite different with regard to the view upholding the existence of Preadamites taken in the common acceptation of the term. It maintains that the men existing before Adam continued to coexist with Adam, and his progeny, thus destroying the unity of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Palmieri (loc. cit.) brands it as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, and Father Pesch ("De Deo creante et elevante", Freiburg, 1909, n. 154) endorses this censure; Esser (Kirchenlex., s.v. Pr&uuml;adamiten) considers it as only theologically certain that there were no Coadamites who were not the progeny of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a>. According to the nature of the arguments advanced in favour of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> Preadamite theory, we may divide it into scientific and Scriptural Preadamism.
<h2 id="section1">Scientific preadamism</h2>

<p>There are no scientific arguments which prove directly that the progeny of a Preadamite race coexisted with the descendants of Adam. The direct conclusion from scientific premises is either the great antiquity of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> or its multiplicity. In either case, or even in the combination of both, the existence of Preadamites depends on a new non-scientific premise, which is at best only an assumption. From the great number of men, from their racial varieties, from the difference of languages, we cannot even infer that all men cannot spring from a common stock, while the ancient national traditions of the Oriental nations, and the <a href="../cathen/11410a.htm">pal&aelig;ontological</a> finds do not even show that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> existed before our Biblical times; much less do these premises furnish any solid basis for the Preadamite theory. (For the unity of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> and its antiquity see <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">H<font size=-2>UMAN</font> R<font size=-2>ACE</font></a>.)
<h2 id="section2">Scriptural preadamism</h2>

<p>Pesch (loc. cit.) considers it <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> adhered to the Preadamite theory, but leaves no room for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to <a href="../cathen/08558b.htm">Julian the Apostate</a>. But these opinions are only a matter of historical interest. In 1555, however, Isaac de La Peyr&#232;re, a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> of a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a> and a follower of the Prince of Cond&eacute;, published in close succession two works: "Pr&aelig;adamit&aelig;, seu Exercitationes super versibus 12, 13, et 14 ep. Pauli ad Romanos", and "Systema theologicum ex Pr&aelig;adamitarum hypothesi. Pars prima". He maintained that Adam is not the father of the whole <a href="../cathen/12620b.htm">human race</a>, but only of the Chosen People. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> spring from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are the descendants of ancestors created before Adam. The creation of these latter took place on the sixth day, and is related in <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#vrs26">Genesis 1:26 sqq.</a>, while Adam was formed after the rest on the seventh day as narrated in <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#vrs7">Genesis 2:7</a>. Adam and his progeny were to live and develop in <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a>, but they were to observe the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of Adam was more grievous than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; for he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> only against nature. This distinction the writer bases on <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul's</a> Epistle to the Romans, v. 12-14: "Until the law [given to Adam]", so La Peyr&#232;re explains the passage, "sin [committed by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>] was in the world; but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> [of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>] was not imputed, when the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was not [given to Adam]". Again, those "who have not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> after the similitude of the transgression of Adam" are the Preadamite <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. La Peyr&#232;re confimed his hypothesis by an appeal to other Scriptural passages: Cain's fear of being killed (<a href="../bible/gen004.htm#vrs14">Genesis 4:14</a>), his flight, his marriage, his building of a city (<a href="../bible/gen004.htm#vrs15">Genesis 4:15, 16</a>), are pointed out as so many indications of the existence of other men than <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a>. The author also claims that ancient Jewish and <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> tradition favours his Preadamite theory.

<p>But La Peyr&#232;re's <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> are not solid. (1) Scripture itself points out that the creation of man in <a href="../bible/gen001.htm#vrs26">Genesis 1:26 sqq.</a>, is identical with that mentioned in <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#vrs7">Genesis 2:7</a>, for according to <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#vrs5">Genesis 2:5</a>, "there was not a man to till the earth"; according to <a href="../bible/gen002.htm#vrs20">Genesis 2:20</a>, "for Adam there was not found a helper like himself"; according to <a href="../bible/gen003.htm#vrs20">3:20</a>, "Adam called the name of his wife Eve: because she was the mother of all the living". Scripture, therefore, knows of no men created before Adam. (2) The appeal to the incidents in the history of Cain loses its force, if we remember that they happened about 120 years after Adam had been driven from <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a>: at that time, the progeny of Adam must have amounted to several thousand <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, so that Cain's fear and flight and his building of a primitive city are easily explained. (3) The difficulty arising from Cain's marriage was satisfactorily explained by St. Augustine (<a href="../fathers/120115.htm"><em>City of God</em> XV.16</a>; cf. Epiphanius, "H&aelig;r.", xxxix, 6), who points out that necessity compelled the immediate offspring of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> to marry even their sisters. (4) The context renders La Peyr&#232;re's explanation of Rom., v, 12-14, impossible. If the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> mentioned in the passage refers to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> given to Adam in <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Paradise</a>, and not to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a>, the phrase "but death reigned from Adam unto Moses" is meaningless, and the whole force of the Apostle's argument is destroyed. (5) Finally, La Peyr&#232;re's appeal to the traditions of the Kabbalists, Chaldeans etc., has been investigated and found wanting by R. Simon ("Lettres choisies", II, <a href="../cathen/01441b.htm">Amsterdam</a>, 1730, ii, xxvii). It is, therefore, not astonishing that La Peyr&#232;re's Preadamism proved to be a nine days' wonder and did not survive its author. The theory was strongly opposed from the beginning by such scholars as Maresius, Hoornbeek, and Voetius on the part of the Reformed Church, and by the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> Calovius, Quenstedt, and Hollarius. The author himself renounced his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and a member of the Oratory. In more recent times a political or social Preadamism has been introduced by Dominic M&rsquo;Causland ("Adam and the Adamite, or the Harmony of Scripture and Ethnology", London, 164) and Reginald Stuart Poole ("The Genesis of the Earth and of Man", London, 1860), who follow the ethnological views of such authorities as Morton, Nott, Gliddon, and Agassiz. They maintain that Adam is the progenitor of the Caucasian race, while the other races descend from Preadamite ancestry, having either a common or various parentage. The pro-slavery sentiment prevalent in certain parts of America indirectly supported such Preadamite theories. But their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must be judged in the light of what has been said about scientific and Scriptural Preadamism.
