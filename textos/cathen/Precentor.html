<h1>Precentor</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>Pr&aelig;centor</em>, from <em>pr&aelig;</em>, before-<em>cantor</em> singer).

<p>A word describing sometimes an ecclesiastical dignitary, sometimes an administrative or ceremonial officer. Anciently, the precentor had various <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>: he was the first or leading chanter, who on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> and greater feasts intoned certain <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, psalms, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, responsories etc.; gave the pitch or tone to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and dean at Mass (the succentor performing a similar office to the canons and clerks); recruited and taught the choir, directed its rehearsals and supervised its official functions; interpreted the <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubrics</a> and explained the ceremonies, ordered in a general way the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> and sometimes composed desired <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, sequences, and lessons of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. He was variously styled <em>capiscol</em> (<em>caput schol&aelig;</em>, head of the choir-school), <em>prior schol&aelig;</em>, <em>magister schol&aelig;</em>, and <em>primicerius</em> (a word of widely different implications). Victor of St. Hugo tells us that in the care of the <em>primicerius</em> were placed the <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a>, <a href="../cathen/05711a.htm">exorcists</a>, <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a>, and psalmists (chanters). In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the principal dignitaries of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, collegiate chapters, and monastic orders, imitated the example of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a> in acting as directors of chant-schools. The <em>schola</em> was always in attendance when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> officiated in his <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, and to the precentor was assigned a place near the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and high in dignity. His office was obviously one demanding much learning and executive ability, and his dignity corresponded with his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedrals</a> of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, he ranked sometimes next to the dean, sometimes next to the <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>. In some instances his sphere of activity was much broader, including the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of installing deans, canons, and other dignitaries; and in some <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of librarian and registrar. But from the fourteenth century his title and dignity were largely handed over to incumbents whose musical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> did not fit them for the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> to which the name of precentor owed its origin; the dignities remained, but the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> became obscured. "In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, some chapters retain traces of the dignity of Precentor, and one may see sometimes an <a href="../cathen/01693a.htm">archdeacon</a>, sometimes a titular or honorary canon, carrying the baton cantoral, the insignia of his office"(<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, "Dict. de Droit Canon", s.v. Chantre). This "baton cantoral" is a silver or white staff. "In the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of <a href="../cathen/01237e.htm">Aix</a>, <a href="../cathen/03331b.htm">Carcassonne</a>, <a href="../cathen/04455b.htm">Coutances</a>, <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a>, <a href="../cathen/10247a.htm">Metz</a>, <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a>, the dignity of Precentor is still the highest in the chapter.... Some chapters have sub-chanters, those of <a href="../cathen/01752c.htm">Arras</a> being among the honorary resident canons" (<a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, "Dict.de Jurisprudence", s.v. Grand Chantre, where also the quoted <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04794b.htm">Dijon</a> may serve to illustrate the modern <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the office of precentor: "The Pr&eacute;centeur or Grand Chantre is the head of the choir and . . . brings the antiphon to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> when officiating pontifically. Sacristans, chanters, choir-boys, and employ&eacute;s of the Cathedral are placed under his surveillance. He will also preserve order and silence in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>"). In the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> the precentor directs the choir, his stall in the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> corresponding with that of the dean.
