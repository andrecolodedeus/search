<h1>Predestinarianism</h1>  

<p>Predestinarianism is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> not unfrequently met with in the course of the centuries which reduces the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> as well as the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a> of the reprobate to one cause alone, namely to the sovereign will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thereby excludes the free co-operation of man as a secondary factor in bringing about a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> or unhappy future in the life to come.
<h2 id="section1">Character and origin</h2>

<p>The essence of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> Predestinarianism may be expressed in these two fundamental propositions which bear to each other the relation of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and effect: <ul><li>the absolute will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the sole cause of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> or damnation of the individual, without regard to his merits or demerits; <li>as to the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, it denies the freedom of the will under the influence of efficacious grace while it puts the reprobate under the necessity of committing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in consequence of the absence of grace.</ul> The system in its general outlines may thus be described: the question why some are saved while others are damned can only be answered by assuming an eternal, absolute, and unchangeable <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> and the damnation of the reprobate are simply the effect of an unconditional Divine <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>. But if those who are <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> for eternal life are to attain this end with metaphysical necessity, and it is only such a necessity that can guarantee the actual accomplishment of the Divine will, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> must give them during their lifetime efficacious <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> of such a nature that the possibility of free resistance is systematically excluded, while, on the other hand, the will, under the influence of grace, is borne along without reluctance to do what is right and is forced to persevere in a course of righteousness to the hour of death. But from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has also made a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> not less absolute whereby he has positively <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> the non-elect to eternal torments. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can accomplish this design only by denying to the reprobate irresistibly efficacious <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> and impelling their will to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> continually, thereby leading them slowly but surely to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a>. As it is owing to the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone that <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is to be filled with <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, without any regard to their merits, so also it is owing to that same will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is to be filled with the reprobate, without any regard to their foreseen <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and demerits and with such only as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, positively, and absolutely destined for this sad lot. In any case <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the most efficacious means of infallibly bringing to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, with some appearance of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, those who are positively destined for reprobation. In its further development Predestinarianism admits of a harsher and of a milder form according as its adherents by insisting exclusively on the salvific will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> push positive reprobation into the background or endeavour to hide under a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> phraseology what is most offensive in their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, i.e. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> supposed relation towards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And yet this element forms the keystone of the whole system. For the all-important question is: Can <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the all just absolutely and positively <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestine</a> anyone to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>? Can the all holy incite and force anyone to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with the intention of consigning him to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a>? The denial of the universality of the salvific will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the restriction of the merits of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's passion</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> are only natural consequences of the fundamental principles of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.

<p>The history of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> shows that the origin of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> Predestinarianism must be traced back to the misunderstanding and misinterpretation of St. Augustine's views relating to eternal election and reprobation. But it was only after the death of this great <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">doctor of the Church</a> (430) that this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> sprang up in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the West, whilst that of the East was preserved in a remarkable manner from these extravagances. Beginning from the anonymous author of the second part of the so-called "Pr&aelig;destinatus" (see below) up to <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, we find that all the adherents of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> have taken refuge behind the stout shield of Augustinism. The question therefore to be answered at present is this: Did St. Augustine teach this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>? We do not wish to gainsay that St. Augustine in the last years of his life fell a victim to an increased rigorism which may find its <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> explanation in the fact that he was called to be the champion of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Christian grace</a> against the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> and Semipelagianism. Still the point at issue is whether he, in order to establish the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of the just, gave up his former position and took refuge in the so-called "irresistible grace" (<em>gratia irresistibilis</em>) which in the just and in those who persevere destroys <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. Not only <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> historians of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> (as Harnack) but also a few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> scholars (Rottmanner, Kolb) even up to the present time have thought that they found in his works evident indications of such a strange view. But among most of the modern students of St. Augustine the conviction is constantly gaining ground that the African Doctor at no time of his life, not even shortly before his death, embraced this dangerous view of grace which <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> claims to have inherited from him. Even the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> writer E.F.K. M&uuml;ller emphasizes the fact that St. Augustine, with regard to the liberty of the will in all conditions of life, "never renounced his repudiation of <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a>, a step which had caused him so severe a struggle" (Realencyk. f&uuml;r prot. Theologie, Leipzig, 1904, XV, 590).



<p>The only ambiguous passage containing the expressions "unavoidable and invincible" (De corrept. et gratia XII, xxxviii: indeclinabiliter et insuperabiliter) does not refer, as is clear from the context, to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> but to the weak will which by means of grace is made invulnerable against all <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, even to the point of being unconquerable, without, however, thereby losing its native freedom. Other difficult passages must likewise be explained in view of the general fundamental principles of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> teaching and especially of the context and the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> connexion of his thoughts (cf. J. Mausbach, "Die Ethik des hl. Augustinus", LI, 25 sq.; Freiburg, 1909). Hence St. Augustine, when towards the end of his life he wrote his "Retractations", did not take back anything in this matter, nor had he any reason for doing so. But as to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> relation to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nothing was further from the thoughts of the great doctor than the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that the Most Holy could in any way or for any purpose force the human will to commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foresees <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but He does not will it; for He must of necessity hate it. St. Augustine draws a sharp distinction between <em>pr&oelig;scire</em> and <em>pr&oelig;destinare</em>, and to him the infallible foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is by no means synonymous with a necessitating <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Thus he says of the fall of Adam (De corrept. et gratia, 12, 37), "Deo quidem pr&aelig;sciente, quid esset Adam facturus injuste; pr&aelig;sciente tamen, non ad hoc cogente" (cf. Mausbach, ibid. 208 sq.). The question whether and in how far St. Augustine assumed, in connexion with the absolute <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, what was later on known as the negative reprobation of the damned, is quite distinct from our present question and has nothing to do with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> Predestinarianism.
<h2 id="section2">The work "pr&aelig;destinatus"</h2>

<p>That the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> after their condemnation by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had a great interest in exaggerating to their ultimate <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> consequences those <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of St. Augustine which may easily be misunderstood, that thereby they might under the mask of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> be enabled to combat more effectually not only the ultra-Augustinian but also the whole <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> on grace, is clearly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by a work written by an anonymous author of the fifth century. This work, edited by <a href="../cathen/14027c.htm">Sirmond</a> for the first time in 1643 in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> under the title of "Pr&aelig;destinatus" (P.L., LIII, 579 sq.), is divided into three parts. The first part contains a catalogue of ninety <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> (from <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> to the <em>H&aelig;resis Pr&aelig;destinatorum</em>) and is nothing less than a barefaced plagiarism from St. Augustine's work "De H&aelig;resibus" and original only in those passages where the writer touches on personal experiences and Roman local traditions (cf. A. Faure, "Die Widerlegung der H&auml;retiker im I. Buch des Pr&aelig;destinatus", Leipzig, 1903). The second part is according to the assertion of the author of the work a treatise circulated (though falsely) under the name of St. Augustine which fell into his hands; this treatise, under the form of a violent polemic against the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, puts forward ultra-Augustinian views on <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> and thus affords a welcome opportunity to a <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> to attack both the one-sided exaggerations of the pseudo-Augustine and the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> on grace of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> St. Augustine. As a matter of fact this favourable opportunity is seized upon by the author in the third and last part, where he reveals his real purpose. Adhering closely to the text of the second part he subtlely endeavours to refute not only Predestinarianism but also (and this is the main point), St. Augustine's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on grace, although for the sake of appearances and to protect himself from attack, <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> is nominally condemned in four <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemata</a> (P.L., LIII, 665). All the older literature concerning this inferior compilation may now be considered as superseded by the recent scholarly work of Schubert, "Der sog. Pr&aelig;destinatus, ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des Pelagianismus" (Leipzig, 1903). We need not, however, entirely accede to the opinion of Schubert that the whole pseudo-Augustine produced in the second part is nothing but a clumsy <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> of the anonymous <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> author himself, who put up a straw man in order the more easily to overthrow him. But there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the meaning, the spirit, and purpose of this man&oelig;uvre. We have to do with a skilful defence of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> against the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on grace as taught by St. Augustine. And the authorship points rather to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> than to southern Gaul (perhaps Arnobius the Younger). This work, written probably about <font size=-2>A.D.</font> 440, emanated from the group of <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> closely associated with <a href="../cathen/08557b.htm">Julian of Eclanum</a>. It is not impossible that a friend of Julian living in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> conceived the hope of making the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> more favourable to <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> by means of this work.
<h2 id="section3">Lucidus and Gottschalk</h2>

<p>Toward the middle of the fifth century <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> Predestinarianism in its harshest form was defended by Lucidus, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Gaul, about whose life in all other respects history is silent. According to his view <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> positively and absolutely <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> some to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal death</a> and others to eternal life, in such a manner that the latter have not to do anything to secure their <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, since <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> of itself carries them on to their destiny. As the non-elect are destined for <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, Christ did not die for them. When <a href="../cathen/06019b.htm">Faustus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Riez, ordered Lucidus to retract, he abandoned his <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalous</a> propositions and even notified the Provincial Synod of Arles (c. 473) of his submission (cf. <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Concil. Collect.", VII, 1010). It seems that within half a century the Predestinarian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> had completely died out in <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, since the Second Synod of Orange (529), although it solemnly condemns this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, still speaks only hypothetically of its adherents; "si sunt, qui tantum malum credere velint" (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchirid.", tenth ed., Freiburg, 1908, n. 200). The controversy was not renewed till the ninth century when <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">Gottschalk of Orbais</a>, appealing to St. Augustine, aroused a long and animated dispute on <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>, which affected the whole <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire. <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a> (about 840) wrote a refutation of <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">Gottschalk's</a> teaching and clearly summed it up in the following proposition (P.L., CXII, 1530 sqq.): As the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> by the Divine foreknowledge and absolute <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, are saved of necessity, so in the same way the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> reprobate become the victims of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p>Through the efforts of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar, Archbishop of Reims</a>, the Synod of Quierzy (849) compelled <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">Gottschalk</a>, whose enforced stay in the Order of St. Benedict had cost him dearly, to burn his writings with his own hand, and silenced him by imprisoning him for life in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Hautvilliers near <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Reims</a>. At the present time, however, scholars, because of two extant professions of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (P.L., CXXI, 347 sq.), are inclined to free the eccentric and obscure <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">Gottschalk</a> from the charge of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and to interpret in an <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> sense his ambiguous teaching on "double <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>" (<em>gemina pr&aelig;destinatio</em>). It was an unhappy thought of <a href="../cathen/07356b.htm">Hincmar</a> to ask the <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> John Scotus Eriugena to write a refutation of <a href="../cathen/06682a.htm">Gottschalk</a>, as this only served to sharpen the controversy. To the great sorrow of Charles the Bald the whole western part of the <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> Empire resounded with the disputes of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, and even of some <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. The Canons of the Provincial Synod of <a href="../cathen/15250a.htm">Valence</a> (855) may be taken as an expression of the then prevailing views on this subject; they emphasize the fact that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has merely foreseen from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and not foreordained the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the reprobate, although it remains <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that in consequence of their foreseen demerits he has decreed from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> the eternal punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, loc. cit., nn. 320-25). It was essentially on this basis that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of fourteen ecclesiastical provinces finally came to an agreement and made peace in the Synod of Tousy held in 860 (cf. Schr&ouml;rs, "Hinkmar von Reims", 66 sq., Freiburg, 1884). The teaching of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> is generally characterized on the one hand by the repudiation of positive reprobation for <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, on the other by the assertion of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">Divine predestination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> for <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> and the co-operation of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>; this teaching was only for a short time obscured by <a href="../cathen/14693b.htm">Thomas Bradwardine</a>, and the so-called precursors of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> (Wyclif, <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Hus</a>, Jerome of Prague, John Wesel).

<p>Heretical Predestinarianism received a new and vigorous impulse at the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> having denied the freedom of the will in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> man as also freedom in the use of grace, <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> placed the eternal destiny of the individual solely and entirely in the hands of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who without any regard to merit or demerit metes out <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> or <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> just as He pleases. <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> endeavoured to obviate the grave consequences that this principle necessarily produces in the moral order by the vain excuse that "just as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> incited the robber to commit <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, so also He forces the judge to impose the penalty of death on the murderer" (De provid. Dei, in "Opera" ed. Schuler, IV, 113). <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> taught expressly that the treason of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> was just as much the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as was the vocation of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (cf. Trident., Sess. VI, can. vi, in <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, n. 816). <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> is the most <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> advocate of Predestinarianism pure and simple. Absolute and positive <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> for eternal life, as well as of the reprobate for <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is one of the chief elements of his whole <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> system and is closely connected with the all-pervading thought of "the glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". Strongly religious by nature and with an <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> for systematizing, but also with a harsh unyielding character, <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> was the first to weave the scattered threads which he thought he had found in St. Paul, St. Augustine, <a href="../cathen/15722a.htm">Wyclif</a>, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer</a>, into a strong network which enveloped his entire system of practical and theoretical <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Thus he became in fact the systematizer of the dread <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. Although <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> does not deny that man had <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> in <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">paradise</a>, still he traces back the fall of Adam to an absolute and positive <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (Instit., I, 15, 8; III, 23, 8).

<p><a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">Original sin</a> completely destroyed the freedom of will in fallen man; nevertheless, it is not the motive of the <em>decretum horribile</em>, as he himself calls the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> or reprobation. <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> is an uncompromising Supralapsarian. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for His own glorification, and without any regard to <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, has created some as "vessels of mercy", others as "vessels of wrath". Those created for <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> He has also <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and whatever <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and righteousness they may exhibit are at most only apparent, since all <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> and means of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> are efficacious only in those <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> for <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> and grace in its principal features is not essentially different from <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a>. The unbearable harshness and cruelty of this system led to a reaction among the better-minded <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, who dreaded setting the "glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" above his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. Even on so strictly <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> a soil as <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, <a href="../cathen/08007a.htm">Infralapsarianism</a>, i.e. the connexion of reprobation with <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, gained ground. <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> also refused to adhere to the strictly <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> Lambeth Articles (1595), although in later years their essential features were embodied in the famous Westminster Confession of 1647 which was so strenuously defended by the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/12581a.htm">Puritans</a>. On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> Church in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> has endeavoured to mitigate the undeniable harshness of <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> in its revision of its Confession in May, 1903, in which it also emphasizes the universality of the Divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and even does not deny the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of children who die in infancy.
