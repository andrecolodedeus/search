<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Predestination</h1>  

<p>Predestination (<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>pr&aelig;</em>, <em>destinare</em>), taken in its widest meaning, is every Divine <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, owing to His infallible prescience of the future, has appointed and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> all events occurring in time, especially those which directly proceed from, or at least are influenced by, man's <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. It includes all historical facts, as for instance the appearance of <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> or the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and particularly the turning-points in the history of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, as the mission of Moses and the Prophets, or the election of Mary to the Divine Motherhood. Taken in this general sense, predestination clearly coincides with <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> and with the government of the world, which do not fall within the scope of this article (see <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">D<font size=-2>IVINE</font> P<font size=-2>ROVIDENCE</font></a>).
<h2 id="section1">Notion of predestination</h2>

<p>Theology restricts the term to those Divine decrees which have reference to the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end of rational beings, especially of man. Considering that not all men reach their <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but that many are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> lost through their own fault, there must exist a twofold predestination: (a) one to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> for all those who die in the state of grace; (b) one to the pains of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> for all those who depart in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or under <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> displeasure. However, according to present usages to which we shall adhere in the course of the article, it is better to call the latter <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> the Divine "reprobation", so that the term predestination is reserved for the Divine <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>.
<h3>A</h3>

<p>The notion of predestination comprises two essential elements: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> infallible foreknowledge (<em>pr&aelig;scientia</em>), and His immutable <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> (<em>decretum</em>) of eternal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> who, following in the footsteps of the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, would limit the Divine activity to the eternal foreknowledge and exclude the Divine will, would at once fall into <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deism</a>, which asserts that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having created all things, leaves man and the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> to their fate and refrains from all active interference. Though the purely natural gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as descent from <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, good <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a>, and the providential guidance of man's external career, may also be called effects of predestination, still, strictly speaking, the term implies only those <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> which lie in the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> sphere, as <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, all <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual graces</a>, and among them in particular those which carry with them <a href="../cathen/11711a.htm">final perseverance</a> and a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> death. Since in reality only those reach <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> who die in the state of justification or <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, all these and only these are numbered among the predestined, strictly so called. From this it follows that we must reckon among them also all children who die in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> grace, as well as those adults who, after a life stained with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, are converted on their death-beds. The same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the numerous predestined who, though outside the pale of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, yet depart from this life in the state of grace as <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a>, schismatics, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mahommedans</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>. Those fortunate <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who at the close of a long life are still clothed in their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> innocence, or who after many relapses into mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> persevere till the end, are not indeed predestined more firmly, but are more signally favoured than the last-named categories of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.

<p>But even when man's <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end alone is taken into consideration, the term predestination is not always used by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> in an unequivocal sense. This need not astonish us, seeing that predestination may comprise wholly diverse things. If taken in its adequate meaning (<em>pr&aelig;destinatio ad&aelig;quata</em> or <em>completa</em>), then predestination refers to both grace and glory as a whole, including not only the election to glory as the end, but also the election to grace as the means, the vocation to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, justification, and <a href="../cathen/11711a.htm">final perseverance</a>, with which a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> death is inseparably connected. This is the meaning of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine's</a> words (De dono persever., xxxv): &quot;Pr&aelig;destinatio nihil est aliud quam pr&aelig;scientia et pr&aelig;paratio beneficiorum, quibus certissime liberantur [i.e. salvantur], quicunque liberantur" (Predestination is nothing else than the foreknowledge and foreordaining of those gracious gifts which make certain the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all who are saved). But the two concepts of grace and glory may be separated and each of them be made the object of a special predestination. The result is the so-called inadequate predestination (<em>pr&aelig;destinatio inad&aelig;quata</em> or <em>incompleta</em>), either to grace alone or to glory alone. Like <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, Augustine, too, speaks of an election to grace apart from the celestial glory (loc. cit., xix): "Pr&aelig;destinatio est grati&aelig; pr&aelig;paratio, gratia vero jam ipsa donatio." It is evident, however, that this (inadequate) predestination does not exclude the possibility that one chosen to grace, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and justification goes nevertheless to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Hence we may disregard it, since it is at bottom simply another term for the universality of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> salvific will and of the distribution of grace among all men (see <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">G<font size=-2>RACE</font></a>). Similarly eternal election to glory alone, that is, without regard to the preceding merits through grace, must be designated as (inadequate) predestination. Though the possibility of the latter is at once clear to the reflecting mind, yet its actuality is strongly contested by the majority of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, as we shall see further on (under <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. III). From these explanations it is plain that the real <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of eternal election is exclusively concerned with adequate predestination, which embraces both grace and glory and the essence of which <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (I, Q. xxiii, a. 2) defines as: "Pr&aelig;paratio grati&aelig; in pr&aelig;senti et glori&aelig; in futuro" (the foreordination of grace in the present and of glory in the future).



<p>In order to emphasize how mysterious and unapproachable is Divine election, the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> calls predestination "hidden mystery". That predestination is indeed a sublime mystery appears not only from the fact that the depths of the eternal counsel cannot be fathomed, it is even externally visible in the inequality of the Divine choice. The unequal standard by which <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> grace is distributed among infants and efficacious <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> among adults is hidden from our view by an impenetrable veil. Could we gain a glimpse at the reasons of this inequality, we should at once hold the key to the solution of the mystery itself. Why is it that this child is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, but not the child of the neighbour? Why is it that Peter the Apostle rose again after his fall and persevered till his death, while <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot</a>, his fellow-Apostle, hanged himself and thus frustrated his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? Though correct, the answer that <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> went to perdition of his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, while Peter faithfully co-operated with the grace of conversion offered him, does not clear up the enigma. For the question recurs: Why did not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> give to <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a> the same efficacious, infallibly successful grace of conversion as to St. Peter, whose blasphemous denial of the Lord was a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no less grievous than that of the traitor <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>? To all these and similar questions the only reasonable reply is the word of St. Augustine (loc. cit., 21): "Inscrutabilia sunt judicia Dei" (the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgments of God</a> are inscrutable).
<h3>B</h3>

<p>The counterpart of the predestination of the good is the reprobation of the wicked, or the eternal <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to cast all men into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> of whom He foresaw that they would die in the state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as his enemies. This plan of Divine reprobation may be conceived either as absolute and unconditional or as hypothetical and conditional, according as we consider it as dependent on, or independent of, the infallible foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the real reason of reprobation. If we understand eternal condemnation to be an absolute unconditional <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, its <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> possibility is affirmed or denied according as the question whether it involves a positive, or only a negative, reprobation is answered in the affirmative or in the negative. The conceptual difference between the two kinds of reprobation lies in this, that negative reprobation merely implies the absolute will not to grant the bliss of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> while positive reprobation means the absolute will to condemn to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. In other words, those who are reprobated merely negatively are numbered among the non-predestined from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; those who are reprobated positively are directly predestined to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and have been created for this very purpose. It was <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> who elaborated the repulsive <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that an absolute Divine <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> positively predestined part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and, in order to obtain this end effectually, also to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> advocates of an unconditional reprobation evade the charge of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> only by imposing a twofold restriction on their hypothesis: (a) that the punishment of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> can, in time, be inflicted only on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> can be decreed only on account of foreseen malice, while <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself is not to be regarded as the sheer effect of the absolute Divine will, but only as the result of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> permission; (b) that the eternal plan of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can never intend a positive reprobation to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, but only a negative reprobation, that is to say, an exclusion from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. These restrictions are evidently demanded by the formulation of the concept itself, since the attributes of Divine <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> must be kept inviolate (<em>see</em> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">GOD</a>). Consequently, if we consider that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> will never allow Him to will <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> positively even though He foresees it in His permissive <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> with infallible <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, and that His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> can foreordain, and in time actually inflict, <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> as a punishment only by reason of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> foreseen, we understand the definition of eternal reprobation given by <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Peter Lombard</a> (I. Sent., dist. 40): "Est pr&aelig;scientia iniquitatis quorundam et pr&aelig;paratio damnationis eorundem" (it is the foreknowledge of the wickedness of some men and the foreordaining of their damnation). Cf. Scheeben, "Mysterien des Christentums" (2nd ed., Freiburg, 1898), 98&mdash;103.
<h2 id="section2">The Catholic dogma</h2>

<p>Reserving the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> controversies for the next section, we deal here only with those <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> relating to predestination and reprobation, the denial of which would involve <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.
<h3 id="A">The predestination of the elect</h3>

<p>He who would place the reason of predestination either in man alone or in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone would inevitably be led into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> conclusions about eternal election. In the one case the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> concerns the last end, in the other the means to that end. Let it be noted that we do not speak of the "cause" of predestination, which would be either the efficient cause (<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>), or the instrumental cause (grace), or the final cause (<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>), or the primary meritorious cause, but of the reason or motive which induced <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> to elect certain definite <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> to grace and glory. The principal question then is: Does the natural merit of man exert perhaps some influence on the Divine election to grace and glory? If we recall the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the absolute gratuity of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Christian grace</a>, our answer must be outright negative (see <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">G<font size=-2>RACE</font></a>). To the further question whether Divine predestination does not at least take into account the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> answers with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is not given to the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> by a purely arbitrary act of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> will, but that it is also the reward of the personal merits of the justified (see <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">M<font size=-2>ERIT</font></a>). Those who, like the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>, seek the reason for predestination only in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> naturally <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, evidently misjudge the nature of the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Christian heaven</a> which is an absolutely <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> destiny. As <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagianism</a> puts the whole economy of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> on a purely natural basis, so it regards predestination in particular not as a special grace, much less as the supreme grace, but only as a reward for natural merit.

<p>The Semipelagians, too, depreciated the gratuity and the strictly <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character of eternal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> by ascribing at least the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (<em>initium fidei</em>) and <a href="../cathen/11711a.htm">final perseverance</a> (<em>donum perseveranti&oelig;</em>) to the exertion of man's natural powers, and not to the initiative of preventing grace. This is one class of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> which, slighting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His grace, makes all <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> depend on man alone. But no less grave are the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> into which a second group falls by making <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone responsible for everything, and abolishing the free co-operation of the will in obtaining eternal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. This is done by the advocates of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/12376b.htm">Predestinarianism</a>, embodied in its purest form in <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinism</a> and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a>. Those who seek the reason of predestination solely in the absolute Will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> forced to admit an irresistibly efficacious grace (<em>gratia irresistibilis</em>), to deny the freedom of the will when influenced by grace and wholly to reject <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> merits (as a secondary reason for eternal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>). And since in this system <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a>, too, finds its only explanation in the Divine will, it further follows that <a href="../cathen/04208a.htm">concupiscence</a> acts on the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> will with an irresistible force, that there the will is not really free to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and that demerits cannot be the cause of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a>.

<p>Between these two extremes the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of predestination keeps the golden mean, because it regards eternal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> primarily as the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His grace, but secondarily as the fruit and reward of the meritorious actions of the predestined. The process of predestination consists of the following five steps: (a) the first grace of vocation, especially <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as the beginning, foundation, and root of justification; (b) a number of additional, <a href="../cathen/06689x.htm">actual graces</a> for the successful accomplishment of justification; (c) justification itself as the beginning of the state of grace and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; (d) <a href="../cathen/11711a.htm">final perseverance</a> or at least the grace of a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> death; (e) lastly, the admission to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal bliss</a>. If it is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of Revelation that there are many who, following this path, seek and find their <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> with infallible <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, then the existence of Divine predestination is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs34">Matthew 25:34</a>; <a href="../bible/rev020.htm#vrs15">Revelation 20:15</a>). <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> says quite explicitly (<a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs28">Romans 8:28 sq.</a>): "we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that to them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all things work together unto good, to such as, according to his purpose, are called to be <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. For whom he foreknew, he also predestinated to be made conformable to the image of his Son; that he might be the first born amongst many brethren. And whom he predestinated, them he also called. And whom he called, them he also justified. And whom he justified, them he also glorified." (Cf. <a href="../bible/eph001.htm#vrs4">Ephesians 1:4-11</a>) Besides the eternal "foreknowledge" and foreordaining, the Apostle here mentions the various steps of predestination: &quot;vocation&quot;, "justification", and "glorification". This <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> has been faithfully preserved by Tradition through all the centuries, especially since the time of Augustine.

<p>There are three other qualities of predestination which must be noticed, because they are important and interesting from the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> standpoint: its immutability, the definiteness of the number of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">predestined</a>, and its subjective uncertainty.

<p>(1) The first quality, the immutability of the Divine <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, is based both on the infallible foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that certain, quite determined <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> will leave this life in the state of grace, and on the immutable will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to give precisely to these men and to no others eternal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> as a reward for their <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> merits. Consequently, the whole future membership of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, down to its minutest details, with all the different measures of grace and the various degrees of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, has been irrevocably fixed from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Nor could it be otherwise. For if it were possible that a predestined individual should after all be cast into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> or that one not predestined should in the end reach <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, then <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would have been mistaken in his foreknowledge of future events; He would no longer be omniscient. Hence the Good Shepherd says of his sheep (<a href="../bible/joh010.htm#vrs28">John 10:28</a>): "And I give them life everlasting; and they shalt not perish forever, and no man shall pluck them out of my hand." But we must beware of conceiving the immutability of predestination either as fatalistic in the sense of the Mahommedan <em>kismet</em> or as a convenient pretext for idle resignation to inexorable fate. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> infallible foreknowledge cannot force upon man unavoidable coercion, for the simple reason that it is at bottom nothing else than the eternal vision of the future historical actuality. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foresees the free activity of a man precisely as that individual is willing to shape it. Whatever may promote the work of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, whether our own <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of others in our behalf, is <em>eo ipso</em> included in the infallible foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and consequently in the scope of predestination (cf. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, I, Q. xxiii, a. 8). It is in such practical considerations that the ascetical maxim (falsely ascribed to St. Augustine) originated: "Si non es pr&aelig;destinatus, fac ut pr&aelig;destineris" (if you are not predestined, so act that you may be predestined). Strict <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, cannot approve this bold saying, except in so far as the original <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of predestination is conceived as at first a hypothetical <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, which is afterwards changed to an absolute and irrevocable <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>, and perseverance of him who is predestined, according to the words of the Apostle (<a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#vrs10">2 Peter 1:10</a>): "Wherefore, brethren, labour the more, that by <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> you may make sure your calling and election."

<p><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> unerring foreknowledge and foreordaining is designated in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> by the beautiful figure of the "Book of Life" (<em>liber vit&aelig;</em>, <em>to biblion tes zoes</em>). This book of life is a list which contains the names of all the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> and admits neither additions nor erasures. From the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/exo032.htm#vrs32">Exodus 32:32</a>; <a href="../bible/psa068.htm#vrs29">Psalm 68:29</a>) this symbol was taken over into the New by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and His <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/luk010.htm#vrs20">Luke 10:20</a>; <a href="../bible/heb012.htm#vrs23">Hebrews 12:23</a>), and enlarged upon by the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelist</a> John in his Apocalypse [cf. <a href="../bible/rev021.htm">Apocalypse 21:27</a>: "There shall not enter into it anything defiled ... but they that are written in the book of life of the Lamb" (cf. <a href="../bible/rev013.htm#vrs8">Revelation 13:8</a>; <a href="../bible/rev020.htm#vrs15">20:15</a>)]. The correct explanation of this symbolic book is given by <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (<a href="../fathers/120120.htm"><em>City of God</em> XX.13</a>): "Pr&aelig;scientia Dei qu&aelig; non potest falli, liber vit&aelig; est" (the foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which cannot <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, is the book of life). However, as intimated by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, there exists a second, more voluminous book, in which are entered not only the names of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, but also the names of all the faithful on earth. Such a metaphorical book is supposed wherever the possibility is hinted at that a name, though entered, might again be stricken out [cf. <a href="../bible/rev003.htm">Apocalypse 3:5</a>: "and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life" (cf. <a href="../bible/exo032.htm#vrs33">Exodus 32:33</a>)]. The name will be mercilessly cancelled when a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sinks into infidelity or godlessness and dies in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Finally there is a third class of books, wherein the wicked deeds and the crimes of individual sinners are written, and by which the reprobate will be judged on the last day to be cast into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/rev020.htm#vrs12">Revelation 20:12</a>): "and the books were opened; ... and the dead were judged by those things which were written in the books according to their works". It was this grand symbolism of Divine omniscience and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that inspired the soul-stirring verse of the <em>Dies ir&oelig;</em> according to which we shall all be judged out of a book: "Liber scriptus proferetur: in quo totum continetur". Regarding the book of life, cf. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, I, Q. xxiv, a. 1&mdash;3, and Heinrich-Gutberlet, "Dogmat. Theologie", VIII (Mainz, 1897), section 453.

<p>(2) The second quality of predestination, the definiteness of the number of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, follows naturally from the first. For if the eternal counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> regarding the predestined is unchangeable, then the number of the predestined must likewise be unchangeable and definite, subject neither to additions nor to cancellations. Anything indefinite in the number would <em>eo ipso</em> imply a lack of certitude in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and would destroy His omniscience. Furthermore, the very nature of omniscience demands that not only the abstract number of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, but also the <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> with their names and their entire career on earth, should be present before the Divine mind from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Naturally, human curiosity is eager for definite information about the absolute as well as the relative number of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>. How high should the absolute number be estimated? But it would be idle and useless to undertake calculations and to guess at so and so many millions or billions of predestined. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (I, Q. xxiii, a. 7) mentions the opinion of some <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> that as many men will be saved as there are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">fallen angels</a>, while others held that the number of predestined will equal the number of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">faithful angels</a>.

<p>Lastly, there were optimists who, combining these two opinions into a third, made the total of men saved equal to the unnumbered myriads of berated spirits. But even granted that the principle of our calculation is correct, no mathematician would be able to figure out the absolute number on a basis so vague, since the number of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> is an unknown quantity to us. Hence, "the best answer", rightly remarks <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, "is to say: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone knows the number of his elect". By relative number is meant the numerical relation between the predestined and the reprobate. Will the majority of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> be saved or will they be damned? Will one-half be damned the other half saved? In this question the opinion of the rigorists is opposed to the milder view of the optimists. Pointing to several texts of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> (<a href="../bible/mat007.htm#vrs14">Matthew 7:14</a>; <a href="../bible/mat022.htm#vrs14">22:14</a>) and to sayings of great spiritual <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, the rigorists defend as probable the thesis that not only most <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> but also most <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are doomed to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a>. Almost repulsive in its tone is <a href="../cathen/10034a.htm">Massillon's</a> sermon on the small number of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>. Yet even St. Thomas (loc. cit., a. 7) asserted: "Pauciores sunt qui salvantur" (only the smaller number of men are saved). And a few years ago, when the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> P. Castelein ("Le rigorisme, le nombre des &eacute;lus et la doctrine du salut", 2nd ed., Brussels, 1899) impugned this theory with weighty arguments, he was sharply opposed by the <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> P. Godts ("De paucitate salvandorum quid docuerunt sancti", 3rd ed., Brussels, 1899). That the number of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> cannot be so very small is evident from the Apocalypse (vii, 9). When one hears the rigorists, one is tempted to repeat <a href="../cathen/04786c.htm">Dieringer's</a> bitter remark: "Can it be that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> actually exists in order to people <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>?" The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is that neither the one nor the other can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from Scripture or Tradition (cf. Heinrich-Gutberlet, "Dogmat. Theologie", Mainz, 1897, VIII, 363 sq.). But supplementing these two sources by arguments drawn from reason we may safely defend as probable the opinion that the majority of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, especially of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, will be saved. If we add to this relative number the overwhelming majority of non-Christians (<a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mahommedans</a>, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>), then Gener* ("Theol. dogmat. scholast.", Rome, 1767, II, 242 sq.) is probably right when he assumes the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of half of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, lest "it should be said to the shame and offence of the Divine majesty and clemency that the [future] Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> is larger than the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of Christ</a>&quot; (cf. W. Schneider, "Das andere Leben", 9th ed., Paderborn, 1908, 476 sq.).

<p>(3) The third quality of predestination, its subjective uncertainty, is intimately connected with its objective immutability. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether we are reckoned among the predestined or not. All we can say is: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone knows it. When the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a>, confounding predestination with the absolute <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, demanded of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> an unshaken <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in his own predestination if be wished to be saved, the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> opposed to this presumptuous <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> the canon (Sess. VI, can. xv): "S. q. d., hominem renatum et justificatum teneri ex fide ad credendum, se certo esse in numero pr&aelig;destinatorum, anathema sit" (if any one shall say that the regenerated and justified man is bound as a matter of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to believe that he is surely of the number of the predestined, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>). In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, such a presumption is not only irrational, but also unscriptural (cf. <a href="../bible/1co004.htm#vrs4">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>; <a href="../bible/1co009.htm#vrs27">9:27</a>; <a href="../bible/1co010.htm#vrs12">10:12</a>; <a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs12">Philippians 2:12</a>). Only a <a href="../cathen/13005a.htm">private revelation</a>, such as was vouchsafed to the penitent thief on the cross, could give us the <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: hence the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Tridentine Council</a> insists (loc. cit., cap. xii): "Nam nisi ex speciali revelatione sciri non potest, quos Deus sibi elegerit" (for apart from a special revelation, it cannot be known whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has chosen). However, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> condemns only that blasphemous presumption which boasts of a faithlike <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> in matters of predestination. To say that there exist probable signs of predestination which exclude all excessive anxiety is not against her teaching. The following are some of the criteria set down by the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>: purity of heart, pleasure in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, patience in suffering, frequent reception of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ and His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, devotion to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, etc.
<h3 id="B">The reprobation of the damned</h3>

<p>An unconditional and positive predestination of the reprobate not only to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, but also to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, was taught especially by <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> (Instit., III, c. xxi, xxiii, xxiv). His followers in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> split into two <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, the Supralapsarians and the <a href="../cathen/08007a.htm">Infralapsarians</a>, the latter of whom regarded <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> as the motive of positive condemnation, while the former (with <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>) disregarded this factor and derived the Divine <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of reprobation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> inscrutable will alone. <a href="../cathen/08007a.htm">Infralapsarianism</a> was also held by <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a> (De gratia Christi, l. X, c. ii, xi sq.), who taught that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had preordained from the <em>massa damnata</em> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> one part to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal bliss</a>, the other to eternal pain, decreeing at the same time to deny to those positively damned the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> by which they might be converted and keep the commandments; for this reason, he said, Christ died only for the predestined (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchiridion", n. 1092-6). Against such blasphemous teachings the Second Synod of Orange in 529 and again the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> had pronounced the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">ecclesiastical anathema</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, nn. 200, 827). This condemnation was perfectly justified, because the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/12376b.htm">Predestinarianism</a>, in direct opposition to the clearest texts of Scripture, denied the universality of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> salvific will as well as of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> through Christ (cf. <a href="../bible/wis011.htm#vrs24">Wisdom 11:24 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#vrs1">1 Timothy 2:1 sq.</a>), nullified <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy towards the hardened sinner (<a href="../bible/eze033.htm#vrs11">Ezekiel 33:11</a>; <a href="../bible/rom002.htm#vrs4">Romans 2:4</a>; <a href="../bible/2pe003.htm#vrs9">2 Peter 3:9</a>), did away with the freedom of the will to do <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and hence with the merit of good actions and the guilt of the bad, and finally destroyed the <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a> of wisdom, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">veracity</a>, <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. The very spirit of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> should have sufficed to deter <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> from a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> explanation of Rom., ix, and his successor Beza from the <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegetical</a> maltreatment of <a href="../bible/1pe002.htm">1 Peter 2:7-8</a>. After weighing all the Biblical texts bearing on eternal reprobation, a modern <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/05692b.htm">exegete</a> arrives at the conclusion: "There is no election to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> parallel to the election to grace: on the contrary, the judgment pronounced on the impenitent supposes human guilt .... It is only after <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">Christ's salvation</a> has been rejected that reprobation follows" ("Realencyk. f&uuml;r prot. Theol.", XV, 586, Leipzig, 1904). As regards the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers of the Church</a>, there is only St. Augustine who might seem to cause difficulties in the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> from Tradition. As a matter of fact he has been claimed by both <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> and <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenius</a> as favouring their view of the question. This is not the place to enter into an examination of his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> on reprobation; but that his works contain expressions which, to say the least, might be interpreted in the sense of a negative reprobation, cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>. Probably toning down the sharper words of the master, his "best pupil", St. Prosper, in his apology against Vincent of Lerin (Resp. ad 12 obj. Vincent.), thus explained the spirit of Augustine: "Voluntate exierunt, voluntate ceciderunt, et quia pr&aelig;sciti sunt casuri, non sunt pr&aelig;destinati; essent autem pr&aelig;destinati, si essent reversuri et in sanctitate remansuri, ac per hoc pr&aelig;destinatio Dei multis est causa standi, nemini est causa labendi" (of their own will they went out; of their own will they fell, and because their fall was foreknown, they were not predestined; they would however be predestined if they were going to return and persevere in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>; hence, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> predestination is for many the cause of perseverance, for none the cause of falling away). Regarding Tradition cf. <a href="../cathen/11743a.htm">Petavius</a>, "De Deo", X, 7 sq.; Jacquin in "Revue de l'histoire eccl&eacute;siastique", 1904, 266 sq.; 1906, 269 sq.; 725 sq.

<p>We may now briefly summarize the whole <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a>, which is in harmony with our reason as well as our moral sentiments. According to the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> decisions of general and particular <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> infallibly foresees and immutably preordains from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> all future events (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, n. 1784), all fatalistic necessity, however, being barred and human liberty remaining intact (Denz., n. 607). Consequently man is free whether he accepts grace and does good or whether he rejects it and does <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (Denz., n. 797). Just as it is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and sincere will that all men, no one excepted, shall obtain eternal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, so, too, Christ has died for all (Denz., n. 794), not only for the predestined (Denz., n. 1096), or for the faithful (Denz., n. 1294), though it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that in reality not all avail themselves of the benefits of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> (Denz., n. 795). Though <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> preordained both eternal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> (Denz., n. 322), yet, on the other hand, He predestined no one positively to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, much less to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (Denz., nn. 200, 816). Consequently, just as no one is saved against his will (Denz., n. 1363), so the reprobate perish solely on account of their wickedness (Denz., nn. 318, 321). <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> foresaw the everlasting pains of the impious from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and preordained this punishment on account of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (Denz., n. 322), though He does not fail therefore to hold out the grace of conversion to sinners (Denz., n. 807), or pass over those who are not predestined (Denz., n. 827). As long as the reprobate live on earth, they may be accounted <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, just as on the other hand the predestined may be outside the pale of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (Denz., nn. 628, 631). Without special revelation no one can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that he belongs to the number of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> (Denz., nn. 805 sq., 825 sq.).
<h2 id="section3">Theological controversies</h2>

<p>Owing to the infallible decisions laid down by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, every <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> theory on predestination and reprobation must keep within the limits marked out by the following theses: (a) At least in the order of execution in time (<em>in ordine executionis</em>) the meritorious works of the predestined are the partial cause of their eternal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>; (b) <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> cannot even in the order of intention (<em>in ordine intentionis</em>) have been positively decreed to the damned, even though it is inflicted on them in time as the just punishment of their misdeeds; (c) there is absolutely no predestination to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as a means to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a>. Guided by these principles, we shall briefly sketch and examine three theories put forward by <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>.
<h3 id="A">The theory of predestination <em>ante pr&aelig;visa merita</em></h3>

<p>This theory, championed by all <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> and a few <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinists</a> (as <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, Francisco Su&aacute;rez, Francis de Lugo), asserts that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by an absolute <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> and without regard to any future <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> merits, predestined from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> certain men to the glory of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and then, in consequence of this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, decided to give them all the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for its accomplishment. In the order of time, however, the Divine <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> is carried out in the reverse order, the predestined receiving first the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> preappointed to them, and lastly the glory of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> as the reward of their <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>. Two qualities, therefore, characterize this theory: first, the absoluteness of the eternal <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, and second, the reversing of the relation of grace and glory in the two different orders of eternal intention (<em>ordo intentionis</em>) and execution in time (<em>ordo executionis</em>). For while grace (and merit), in the order of eternal intention, is nothing else than the result or effect of glory absolutely decreed, yet, in the order of execution, it becomes the reason and partial cause of eternal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, as is required by the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the meritoriousness of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> (see <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">M<font size=-2>ERIT</font></a>). Again, celestial glory is the thing willed first in the order of eternal intention and then is made the reason or motive for the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> offered, while in the order of execution it must be conceived as the result or effect of <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> merits. This concession is important, since without it the theory would be intrinsically impossible and theologically untenable.

<p>But what about the positive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>? The theory can find decisive evidence in Scripture only on the supposition that predestination to heavenly glory is unequivocally mentioned in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> as the Divine motive for the special <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a> granted to the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>. Now, although there are several texts (e.g. <a href="../bible/mat024.htm#vrs22">Matthew 24:22 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/act013.htm#vrs48">Acts 13:48</a>, and others) which might without straining be interpreted in this sense, yet these passages lose their imagined force in view of the fact that other explanations, of which there is no lack, are either possible or even more probable. The ninth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans in particular is claimed by the advocates of absolute predestination as that "classical" passage wherein St. Paul seems to represent the eternal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a> not only as the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> purest mercy, but as an act of the most arbitrary will, so that grace, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, justification must be regarded as sheer effects of an absolute, Divine <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/rom009.htm#vrs18">Romans 9:18</a>: "Therefore he hath mercy on whom he will; and whom he will, he hardeneth"). Now, it is rather daring to quote one of the most difficult and obscure passages of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> as a "classical text" and then to base on it an argument for bold speculation. To be more specific, it is impossible to draw the details of the picture in which the Apostle compares <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the potter who hath "power over the clay, of the same lump, to make one vessel unto <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and another unto dishonour" (<a href="../bible/rom009.htm#vrs21">Romans 9:21</a>), without falling into the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> predestined some men to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> just as positively as he pre-elected others to eternal life. It is not even admissible to read into the Apostle's thought a negative reprobation of certain men. For the primary intention of the Epistle to the Romans is to insist on the gratuity of the vocation to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> and to reject the Jewish presumption that the possession of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a> and the carnal descent from Abraham gave to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> an essential preference over the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>. But the Epistle has nothing to do with the speculative question whether or not the free vocation to grace must be considered as the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> result of eternal predestination to celestial glory [cf. <a href="../cathen/06242a.htm">Franzelin</a>, "De Deo uno", thes. lxv (Rome, 1883)].

<p>It is just as difficult to find in the writings of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> a solid argument for an absolute predestination. The only one who might be cited with some semblance of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is St. Augustine, who stands, however, almost alone among his predecessors and successors. Not even his most faithful pupils, Prosper and Fulgentius, followed their master in all his exaggerations. But a problem so deep and mysterious, which does not belong to the substance of Faith and which, to use the expression of <a href="../cathen/03477c.htm">Pope Celestine I</a> (d. 432), is concerned with <em>profundiores difficilioresque partes incurrentium qu&aelig;stionum</em> (cf. Denz., n. 142), cannot be decided on the sole authority of Augustine. Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> opinion of the African doctor is a matter of dispute even among the best authorities, so that all parties claim him for their conflicting views [cf. O. Rottmanner, "Der Augustinismus" (Munich, 1892); Pf&uuml;lf, "Zur Pr&auml;destinationslehre des hl. Augustinus" in "Innsbrucker Zeitschrift f&uuml;r kath. Theologie", 1893, 483 sq.]. As to the unsuccessful attempt made by <a href="../cathen/06634a.htm">Gonet</a> and Billuart to prove absolute predestination <em>ante pr&aelig;visa merita</em> "by an argument from reason", see Pohle, "Dogmatik", II, 4th ed., Paderborn, 1909, 443 sq.
<h3 id="B">The theory of the negative reprobation of the damned</h3>

<p>What deters us most strongly from embracing the theory just discussed is not the fact that it cannot be dogmatically <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from Scripture or Tradition, but the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> necessity to which it binds us, of associating an absolute predestination to glory, with a reprobation just as absolute, even though it be but negative. The well-meant efforts of some <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> (e.g. Billot) to make a distinction between the two concepts, and so to escape the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> consequences of negative reprobation, cannot conceal from closer inspection the helplessness of such <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> artifices. Hence the earlier partisans of absolute predestination never denied that their theory compelled them to assume for the wicked a parallel, negative reprobation &mdash; that is, to assume that, though not positively predestined to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, yet they are absolutely predestined not to go to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> (cf. above, I, B). While it was easy for the <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> to bring this view into <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> harmony with their <em>pr&aelig;motio physica</em>, the few <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinists</a> were put to straits to harmonize negative reprobation with their <em>scientia media</em>. In order to disguise the harshness and cruelty of such a Divine <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> invented more or less palliative expressions, saying that negative reprobation is the absolute will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to "pass over" a priori those not predestined, to "overlook" them, "not to elect" them, "by no means to admit" them into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>. Only <a href="../cathen/06634a.htm">Gonet</a> had the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to call the thing by its right name: "exclusion from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>" (<em>exclusio a gloria</em>).

<p>In another respect, too, the adherents of negative reprobation do not agree among themselves, namely, as to what is the motive of Divine reprobation. The rigorists (as Alvarez, <a href="../cathen/05547a.htm">Estius</a>, Sylvius) regard as the motive the sovereign will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who, without taking into account possible <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and demerits, determined a priori to keep those not predestined out of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, though He did not create them for <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.

<p>A second milder opinion (e.g. de Lemos, <a href="../cathen/16041d.htm">Gotti</a>, <a href="../cathen/06634a.htm">Gonet</a>), appealing to the Augustinian <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <em>massa damnata</em>, finds the ultimate reason for the exclusion from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> in <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could, without being <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, leave as many as He saw fit. The third and mildest opinion (as Goudin, Graveson, Billuart) derives reprobation not from a direct exclusion from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, but from the omission of an "effectual election to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>"; they represent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as having decreed <em>ante pr&aelig;visa merita</em> to leave those not predestined in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> weakness, without denying them the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> sufficient <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">graces</a>; thus they would perish infallibility (cf. &quot;Innsbrucker Zeitschrift f&uuml;r kath. Theologie&quot;, 1879, 203 sq.).

<p>Whatever view one may take regarding the internal probability of negative reprobation, it cannot be harmonized with the dogmatically certain universality and sincerity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> salvific will. For the absolute predestination of the blessed is at the same time the absolute will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> "not to elect" a priori the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> (Suarez), or which comes to the same, "to exclude them from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>" (<a href="../cathen/06634a.htm">Gonet</a>), in other words, not to save them. While certain <a href="../cathen/14698b.htm">Thomists</a> (as <a href="../cathen/02247a.htm">Ba&ntilde;ez</a>, Alvarez, <a href="../cathen/06634a.htm">Gonet</a>) accept this conclusion so far as to degrade the "voluntas salvifica" to an ineffectual "velleitas", which conflicts with evident doctrines of revelation, Francisco Su&aacute;rez labours in the sweat of his brow to safeguard the sincerity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> salvific will, even towards those who are reprobated negatively. But in vain. How can that will to save be called serious and sincere which has decreed from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> the metaphysical impossibility of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? He who has been reprobated negatively, may exhaust all his efforts to attain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: it avail's him nothing. Moreover, in order to realize infallibly his <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is compelled to frustrate the eternal welfare of all excluded a priori from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and to take care that they die in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Is this the language in which <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> speaks to us? No; there we meet an anxious, loving father, who wills not "that any should perish, but that all should return to penance" (<a href="../bible/2pe003.htm#vrs9">2 Peter 3:9</a>). <a href="../cathen/09192a.htm">Lessius</a> rightly says that it would be indifferent to him whether he was numbered among those reprobated positively or negatively; for, in either case, his <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a> would be certain. The reason for this is that in the present economy exclusion from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> means for adults practically the same thing as damnation. A middle state, a merely natural <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, does not exist.
<h3 id="C">The theory of predestination <em>post pr&aelig;visa merita</em></h3>

<p>This theory defended by the earlier <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a> (<a href="../cathen/01298a.htm">Alexander of Hales</a>, <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a>), as well as by the majority of the <a href="../cathen/10437a.htm">Molinists</a>, and warmly recommended by <a href="../cathen/06220a.htm">St. Francis de Sales</a> "as the truer and more attractive opinion", has this as its chief distinction, that it is free from the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> necessity of upholding negative reprobation. It differs from predestination <em>ante pr&aelig;visa merita</em> in two points: first, it rejects the absolute <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> and assumes a hypothetical predestination to glory; secondly, it does not reverse the succession of grace and glory in the two orders of eternal intention and of execution in time, but makes glory depend on merit in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> as well as in the order of time. This hypothetical <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> reads as follows: Just as in time eternal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> depends on merit as a condition, so I intended <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> only for foreseen merit. &#151; It is only by reason of the infallible foreknowledge of these merits that the hypothetical <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> is changed into an absolute: These and no others shall be saved.

<p>This view not only safeguards the universality and sincerity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> salvific will, but coincides admirably with the teachings of St. Paul (cf. <a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#vrs8">2 Timothy 4:8</a>), who knows that there "is laid up" (<em>reposita est</em>, <em>apokeitai</em>) in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> "a crown of justice", which "the just judge will render" (<em>reddet</em>, <em>apodosei</em>) to him on the day of judgment. Clearer still is the inference drawn from the sentence of the universal Judge (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs34">Matthew 25:34 sq.</a>): "Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat" etc. As the "possessing" of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of Heaven</a> in time is here linked to the works of mercy as a condition, so the "preparation" of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of Heaven</a> in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, that is, predestination to glory is conceived as dependent on the foreknowledge that <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> will be performed. The same conclusion follows from the parallel sentence of condemnation (<a href="../bible/mat025.htm#vrs41">Matthew 25:41 sq.</a>): "Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For I was hungry, and you gave me not to eat&quot; etc. For it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">"everlasting fire of hell"</a> can only have been intended from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and demerit, that is, for neglect of <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">Christian charity</a>, in the same sense in which it is inflicted in time. Concluding <em>a pari</em>, we must say the same of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal bliss</a>. This explanation is splendidly confirmed by the Greek <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>. Generally speaking, the Greeks are the chief authorities for conditional predestination dependent on foreseen merits. The Latins, too, are so unanimous on this question that St. Augustine is practically the only adversary in the Occident. St. Hilary (In Ps. lxiv, n. 5) expressly describes eternal election as proceeding from "the choice of merit" (<em>ex meriti delectu</em>), and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> teaches in his paraphrase of Rom., viii, 29 (De fide, V, vi, 83): "Non enim ante pr&aelig;destinavit quam pr&aelig;scivit, sed quorum merita pr&aelig;scivit, eorum pr&aelig;mia pr&aelig;destinavit&quot; (He did not predestine before He foreknew, but for those whose merits He foresaw, He predestined the reward). To conclude: no one can accuse us of boldness if we assert that the theory here presented has a firmer basis in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> and <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a> than the opposite opinion.
