The establishment of this mission was the outcome of the agitation stirred up in the British Parliament by a detailed account of the atrocities perpetrated on the unfortunate Indians by the officials of a British rubber company operating in Putumayo, a distant district of <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, at the head waters of the Amazon. For years this company had forced the Indians to collect crude rubber for them in the forests, and enforced their orders by tortures and scourging, inflicted by <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> overseers imported from the Barbados for the purpose. Even <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children were not spared. The charges made by Sir Roger Casement, who visited the district at the request of the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">British</a> Government, were in the main corroborated by the report of Romulo Paredes, a special independent investigator sent to the region by the <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peruvian</a> Government. For years the few missionaries in the district had appealed to the <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peruvian</a> authorities, when the opportunity presented itself, to protect the Indians, but until the agitation provoked by the revelations in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> occurred and action was taken by the British and <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> governments, no attention was paid to their petitions on behalf of the suffering natives.

Libermann</a> at the request of Mgr. da Costa-Aguiar, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Amazonas, whose immense diocese erected only five years earlier was practically devoid of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. The first mission was established by R. P. Berthon in June, 1907 at Teff&eacute;, a town on the Amazon 700 miles from Manaos, and 1600 miles from the Atlantic.
