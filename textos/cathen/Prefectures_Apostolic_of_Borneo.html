<h1>Prefectures Apostolic of Borneo</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">Dutch Borneo</h2>

<p>The former Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> was composed of Sumatra, Java, and the other Sundra Islands, including Borneo, under the control of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. The northern part of Borneo, now under British suzerainty, was separated from this immense vicariate, 27 August, 1855; that part of Borneo which is under <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> rule was taken from the Vicariate Apostolic of Batavia, 11 February, 1905, and made into a separate prefecture under the care of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>. The missionaries for the new prefecture were selected from the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> province of this order and the first <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a> was appointed 10 April, 1905. Up to the time of the separation what is now the Prefecture of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Borneo was administered by the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> who had charge of the <a href="../cathen/02346b.htm">Vicariate of Batavia</a>, and who visited the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Borneo twice a year. In 1875 the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Father de Vriez built a little church at Singkawang, a small town situated on the west coast of the island. In the neighbourhood of Singkawang there were nearly 200 <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and 118 soldiers. In 1890 Father Staal, afterwards <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Batavia founded a station in the interior at Smitau. The station was afterwards transferred to Sedjiram on the Penboeang in the region inhabited by the Dyaks. The mission at Sedjiram gave good promise of success and in 1897 included 400 <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but the missionaries were too few in number to give the station constant supervision, and it was consequently abandoned. Later the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> decided to erect a separate prefecture covering an area of 204,633 square miles. According to the "Statistics of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> Missions" for 1906, there were in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Borneo at that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> 8 <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 4 brothers, 396 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, consisting of 210 Chinese, 100 Dyaks and 86 <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a>; 2 stations, Singkawang and Sedjiram; 3 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; 20 conversions were claimed. There had been 56 <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a> and 156 communions, the latter number referring to the Catholie <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> as, outside of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a>, there are no religious in the prefecture. The population included in the prefecture is 2,000,000. A report of 26 November, 1906 gave the founding of a third station at Samarinda on the east coast of Borneo, some two weeks' sail from Singkawang, and of a fourth station at Pamangkat, which is seven hours from Singkawang.
<h2 id="section2">British Borneo (the prefecture of north Borneo and Labuan)</h2>

<p>In 1687 Father <a href="../cathen/15343a.htm">Ventimiglia</a>, a <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatine</a>, was commissioned by <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Pope Innocent XI</a> to preach <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in Borneo. There are no memorials of this mission, which has left no traces in the island although the missionary declared that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had blessed his labours. The <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, 27 August, 1855, decreed the erection of the northern part of the island of Borneo into an independent prefecture and entrusted it to the Rev. Charles Cuarteron, a <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a>. Father Cuarteron was originally a sea-captain and had vowed, after escaping great peril, to devote himself to the evangelization of Borneo. He landed at Labuan in 1857, in company with several missionaries who deserted him in 1860. Although alone in the island of Labuan Father Cuarteron <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courageously</a> continued his labours. At length, seeing that isolation made him powerless, he went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 1879 to request that the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> place the mission in charge of an institute. From <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Father Cuarteron went to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, where he soon died. The British had obtained the island of Labuan in 1846; they gradually extended their power over the petty rulers of the northern part of Borneo until, in 1888, the British Protectorate of North Borneo was formally acknowledged. English speaking missionaries being desired in the British part of Borneo, the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> (19 Mareh, 1881) confided the mission of North Borneo and Labuan to the Soeiety for Foreign Missions of Mill-hill, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The first prefect Apostolie appointed under the new administration was the Rev. Thomas Jackson. The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> has since continued in charge of the mission.

<p>The island of Labuan has an area of 30 square miles and contains 6,800 inhabitants; it is an important shipping station between Singapore and Hong-Kong. The prefect Anostolic lives at Labuan. The stations served are Labuan and Sarawak (Kuching), the two most important towns. Outside of these two places where the missionaries live there are ten stations which are visited: Sibu, Kanowit, Egan, Oya, Mukah, Baram, Papar, Jesselton, Patatan, and Sandakan. According to the "Missions-Atlas" of P. Streit, the statistics of the mission are: 19 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 2 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, 15 <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">sisters</a>; 8 <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>; 20 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a>; 16 catechists; 14 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> with 740 pupils; 2,600 <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>; about 1,000 <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>.
