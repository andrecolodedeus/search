<h1>Premonstratensian Canons</h1>  

<p>(C<font size=-2>ANONICI</font> R<font size=-2>EGULARES</font> P<font size=-2 >R&#198;MONSTRATENSES</font>).

<p>Founded in 1120 by St. Norbert at <a href="../cathen/12392a.htm">Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;</a>, near Laon, <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. At first they were not bound by any fixed rule, charity being the bond of their union, and the example of their founder their rule of life. After a while Norbert unfolded his mind to his disciples on the special regulations which they should adopt. He told them that he had already consulted learned <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>; that by some he was advised to lead an <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">eremitical</a> life, by others a monastic life, or else to join the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian Order</a>. He added that, if he had to follow his own inclinations, he preferred the canonical life of the Apostles, but that, before all, they must <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and do the will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It was then that <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>, appeared to him and gave him his rule, saying: "I am Augustine, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/07360b.htm">Hippo</a>; behold here the rule which I have written; if your fellow-brethren, my sons, shall have observed it well, they shall stand without fear in the presence of Christ on the terrible day of the last judgment". As all agreed to the choice of a canonical institute, Norbert composed a formulary of their profession, which they pronounced on the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Feast of Christmas</a>, 1121. To this formulary St. Norbert added fastings, abstinence, and other works of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, together with some <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> customs and practices peculiar to monastic orders, whereby his order became, as it were, monastico-canonical.

<p>The five particular ends of the Norbertine Order are: <em>Laus Dei in choro</em> (the singing of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>); <em>Zelus animarum</em> (<a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>); <em>Spiritus jugis p&oelig;nitenti&aelig;</em> (the spirit of habitual penance); <em>Cultus Eucharisticus</em> (a special devotion to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a>); <em>Cultus Marianus</em> (a special <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Blessed Virgin</a>, mostly to her Immaculate Conception). The two first arise from the nature of a canonical order, which is both contemplative and active. The third is taken from monastic orders. The fourth and fifth are characteristic of the Norbertine Order, to which these special devotions were bequeathed by the founder. The title of the first chapter of the "Statuta", "De tremendo altaris Sacramento", seems to indicate that devotion to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> as a sacrifice and sacrament would have the first place in the heart of a son of St. Norbert. St. Norbert wrote an Office in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Immaculate Conception which contained these words: "Ave, Virgo qu&aelig; Spiritu Sancto pr&aelig;servante, de tanto primi parentis peccato triumphasti innoxia!" The third chapter of the "Statuta" begins with these words: "Hor&aelig; Deipar&aelig; Virginis Mari&aelig;, candidi ordinis nostri patron&aelig; singularis, etc." Guerenus writes in his commentaries on the Canticle of Canticles: "St. Norbert, with his holy Order, was raised up by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> to render conspicuous in his day two mysteries, the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07674d.htm">Immaculate Conception of Our Lady</a>".

<p>As to the second end, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, the preface to the "Statuta" says: "Our order is the propogation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> glory; it is <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, the administration of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, service in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. Our order is to preach the Gospel, to teach the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, to have the direction of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, to perform pastoral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, etc." At the time of <a href="../cathen/11100b.htm">St. Norbert</a> the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were not numerous, often badly prepared for their ministry, and dissolute. Besides, there were numerous villages without church or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. What was needed was <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> training to impart <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and learning. The order has had its share in the carrying out of this good work, and the Norbertine Abbeys have been called, by <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> of missionaries and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. From its beginning the order has accepted <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> which were, and are still, in many cases administered by Norbertine <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. That the Order of Pr&eacute;montr&eacute; may obtain <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> and administer <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> was again decided by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Oneroso" of 1 Sept., 1750.
<h2>Composition of the order</h2>

<p>The order is composed of three classes: (1) <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> under an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> or <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>; (2) <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> who embrace the Rule of St. Norbert; (3) members of the third Order of St. Norbert. Both <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> have a two years' <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and make solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. In some countries Norbertine <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> are now bound by simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> only. In the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> there are laybrothers and laysisters who likewise make their <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. The members of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a>, originally called <em>fratres et sorores ad succurrendum,</em> wear the white <a href="../cathen/13508b.htm">scapular</a> under their secular dress and have certain <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to say. The spirit of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> must evidently be the spirit of the order itself. The members should possess <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a>, and practise and promote an enlightened devotion to the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Holy Eucharist</a> and to the Immaculate Conception. As a modern author (Duhayon, S.J., "La Mine d'or", c. v) says: "By the institution of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> in the midst of the stream of temporal anxieties St. Norbert has introduced the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> into the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> circle. Nobody before St. Norbert had conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of realizing in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a state of life which should be midway between the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a> and the world, or in other words a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order which should penetrate into the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> homes.&hellip; After his death it was imitated by other founders, especially by St. Francis and <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a>".


<h2>Propagation of the order</h2>

<p>The order increased very rapidly and, in the words of <a href="../cathen/01156c.htm">Adrian IV</a>, it spread its branches from sea to sea. Before the death of Hugh of Fosse, the first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> general, a hundred and twenty <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> were present at the general chapter. Of the first disciples, nearly all became <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of new foundations, and several were raised to the episcopal dignity. Development was chiefly effected through the foundation of new <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, but several <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities already in existence wished to adopt the constitutions of Pr&eacute;montr&eacute; and were affiliated to and incorporated with the order. We have already mentioned the names of <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> founded in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, but colonies of the sons of St. Norbert were sent to nearly every country of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> and even to <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>. In 1130 King Stephen gave them his castle on the River Keres, and thus was founded the Abbey of St. Stephen, the first of numerous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>. Almaric, who had shared in St. Norbert's apostolate, a famous preacher in aid of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a>, was requested by <a href="../cathen/08012a.htm">Innocent II</a> to preach in Palestine. At the head of a chosen band of Norbertines he set out in 1136 for the Holy Land, where he was hospitably received by Fulco of Anjou, King of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, and by William, <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">Patriarch</a> of the Holy City. In the following year Almaric founded the Abbey of St. Abacuc. Henry Zdik, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11247a.htm">Olm&uuml;tz</a>, made a <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> to Jerusalem. He visited St. Abacuc and was so much touched by what he saw that he asked to be received into the order. Having obtained some religious, he returned to <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> and founded the Abbey of Mount Sion at <a href="../cathen/14312a.htm">Strahov</a>, Prague. This <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> flourished so much that it was called the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, having given eight <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, ten to Olm&uuml;tz, and some to other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>; a patriarch (John of Luxemburg) to <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> (John of Prague) to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In 1141 the Abbey of St. Samuel, near <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>, was founded, and in 1145 another at Bethlehem. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> were destroyed in 1187, when many of the religious were put to the sword or perished in the fire. Those who escaped founded a new community at Acre; but in 1291 this place, the last stronghold of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in the Holy Land, was taken by the Sultan Saraf, who cut to pieces the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, Egide de Marle, and put the religious, twenty-six in number, to death.

<p>In 1147 Abbot Walter of Laon led a colony to <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a> and founded the Abbey of St. Vincent, near <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>. Two young Spanish noblemen, Sanchez de Assures and Dominic, while travelling in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, had heard of St. Norbert. They went to Pr&eacute;montr&eacute; and were admitted to the order by St. Norbert. <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, they were sent to preach in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, and having obtained a few religious from La Case-Dieu, an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in Gascony, they founded in 1143 the Abbey of Retorta, the first in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. In 1149 the mother-house sent some of its religious to found the Abbey of St. Samuel at Barletta, in Apulia, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. At the same time sons of St. Norbert went forth from one <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> or another to found new houses in Great Britain and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, <a href="../cathen/11117b.htm">Norway</a>, and even Riga on the Baltic Sea. In addition, sixteen <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters were composed of Norbertine canons, under a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> elected by them. One of these was Candida Casa or Whithorn, in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. It is impossible to give the exact number of <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>, <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, so much do the various lists differ from one another. Perhaps the oldest list known is that which was made for the general chapter of 1320, and given by Le Paige. The most complete has been compiled by Hugo, the <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalist</a> of the order. Some authors say that there were 1300 <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and 500 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, without counting the smaller residences, but these figures seem to be much exaggerated. However, whatever these lists may mean, they show the prodigious fecundity of the order during the first two centuries of its existence.
<h2>Organization</h2>

<p>The highest authority of the order is centered in the general chapter. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> general presides over it, but he owes obedience to it. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> general has the power to make the <a href="../cathen/15479a.htm">canonical visitation</a> of any <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, but his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> is visited by the three principal <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> of the order, viz. by the Abbots of Laon, Floreffe, and Cuissy. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> are elected for life in a manner prescribed by the "Statuta". The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> names his prior and other officials of his <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. In certain matters he has to obtain the consent of the <em>majores de domo</em>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> were divided into circaries (provinces), named after the countries in which they were situated. Each circary had a visitor and the most important had also a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> named by the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> general. Hugo in his "Annales" gives the names of each <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> and of the circary to which they belonged. The four large volumes of the "Annales" give a description and an historical notice of each <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> and hence they supply very important information to the student of the history of the order. Hugo had also prepared and nearly completed, when he died in 1739, two more volumes, the first of which was to treat of learned <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the order and of the books they had written; the second was to give the lives of sons and daughters of St. Norbert, who had been <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> or <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a>, or who were deemed to have had the note of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>. The Rev. Leo Goovaerts, of the Norbertine Abbey of Averbode, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, has since published a "Dictionnaire bio-bibliographique", in which he gives the names of over three thousand authors, a notice of their lives, and a description of the books they had written. George Lienhardt, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Roggensburg, gives in his "Hagiologia" the names of hundreds of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whose <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life constitutes the brightest ornament of the Order of St. Norbert.
<h2>Loss of first fervour; causes and remedies</h2>

<p>The spiritual fervour, so remarkable and edifying in the first two centuries, had gradually been growing cold. A number of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> communities were no longer animated by the spirit of St. Norbert. With the gradual disappearance of manual labour, <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> activity, and certain observances, spiritual progress was retarded and even a kind of spiritual stagnation set in, to the great detriment of these communities. Affluence was another cause of this weakness. The first religious had cleared part of the forests, and by making the land more productive had created more resources, while the charity of benefactors had also increased the revenues, and with this affluence arose also a spirit of worldliness; but another <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was that this affluence excited the rapacity of covetous men in <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>. The superiors of some houses had become more lax in abolishing abuses, and so irregularities had gradually crept in. Owing to the distance of many houses from the mother-house at <a href="../cathen/12392a.htm">Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;</a> and also to national aspirations, cohesion, the strength of any <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>, had been weakened in the order; already in <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> a tendency was observed to form separate congregations with regulations of their own. With the approval of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> the austere rule, especially with regard to perpetual abstinence from flesh meat, was mitigated first in 1290, then in the constitutions of 1505, and again in those of 1630, but in spite of these mitigations, the "statuta" composed and approved in the time of <a href="../cathen/11100b.htm">St. Norbert</a> have remained substantially the same as they were in the beginning. At the beginning of the seventeenth century a new spirit seemed to animate the whole order, but especially in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, where the venerable Abbot Lairvelz succeeded in reforming forty <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and in introducing into them the observances of the primitive constitutions. It was seen that the order was full of vitality and doing good and useful work. To encourage the studies of their religious, colleges were established near some <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>, as at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, Paris, <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>, <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a>, Salamanca, and elsewhere. To these colleges and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> young religious were sent. After the completion of their studies they returned to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, where they taught <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>.
<h2>Commendatory abbots</h2>

<p>To speak of one country only, the concordat between <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> and <a href="../cathen/06207a.htm">Francis I</a> in 1516, which gave power to the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to nominate <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and other Church dignitaries, was abused to such an extent that, with reference to <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> alone, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, and even <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> were put at the head of an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, and sometimes of two or more <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>. They took possession of all the temporalities, and frequently cared nothing for the material and spiritual welfare of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. And all this was done when <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a> and <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> were making the fiercest attacks on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, and when earnest men were pleading for reform in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> institutions. Hugo, the <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">annalist</a> of the order, who gives the lists of <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> elected by the order or commendatory, shows how far the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> had prevailed for more than two hundred years. Tai&eacute;e (vol. II, 195) in his "Etude sur Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;" (Laon, 1874), writes that in 1770, of the 92 Norbertine <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, 67 were given <em><a href="../cathen/07719a.htm">in commendam</a></em> and only 25 had <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> or <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> of the order.
<h2>Loss of abbeys</h2>

<p>Owing to a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the general chapter numerous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> had already disappeared before the end of the twelfth century. As to <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> the continuous <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> in many countries, and in the East the invasions of Tatars and <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a>, made community life almost impossible and ruined many <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Hus</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> destroyed several <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>. The Abbey of Episcopia in the Isle of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> was taken by <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> in 1571. The <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> took possession of several houses in <a href="../cathen/10561a.htm">Moravia</a> and <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>; the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, in <a href="../cathen/13497b.htm">Saxony</a>, <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, and Sweden; the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a>, in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>; and <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>. In <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> many were destroyed by Solyman. With all these losses the order had still in 1627 twenty-two provinces or circaries, and Lienhardt gives a list of 240 houses still in existence in 1778. <a href="../cathen/08508b.htm">Joseph II</a> of <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> suppressed many houses and put others under commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, but Leopold, Joseph's successor, restored nine <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> and with these he incorporated others. The <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> suppressed in 1790 all <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">religious houses</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in 1796 in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and afterwards all those in the occupied provinces of the Rhine. Only a few houses were still existing (9 in the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian Empire</a>, 3 in Russian <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a>, and 15 in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>), but the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> were suppressed by the revolution which convulsed that country in 1833. The dispersed religious of the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Province had long wished to reassemble and form new communities, but they were not allowed to do so under the <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Government (1815-30). When <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> was separated from <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> and made into a separate kingdom, freedom of religion was granted, and the surviving religious, now well advanced in years, revived community life and reconstituted five Norbertine houses in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> (see <a href="../cathen/02190d.htm">B<font size=-2>ACKX</font></a>.)

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> of the confiscated abbey of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a> in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> founded a new <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at <a href="../cathen/07190c.htm">Heeswijk</a>. The Abbey of Berne-Heeswijk has founded St. Norbert's Priory at West De Pere, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, U.S.A. To the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> is attached a flourishing classical and commercial college. The Abbey of Grimbergen in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> obtained possession of the former Norbertine Abbey of Mondaye in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and founded a new <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Mondaye in turn founded the <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> of St. Joseph at Balarin (Department of Gers) and of St. Peter at <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a>. The Abbey of Tongerloo has founded three <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, viz.: Crowle, Spalding, and <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>. The same <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> has also sent missionaries to <a href="../cathen/04228a.htm">Belgian Congo</a>, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, where the Prefecture of Ouell&eacute; (Well&eacute;) has been confided to them. The prefecture has four chief centres: Ibembo, Amadi, Gombari, and Djabar, with many stations served from each centre. The Abbey of Averbode founded three Priories in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> (Pirapora, Jaguar&#227;o, and Petropolis), with a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> attached to each <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a>. The abbey of the Park, near <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, has also sent to <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who have charge of <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and do missionary work. The Abbey of Brimbergen founded a house of the order at Wetaskiwin, in Alberta, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>. The Priory of West De Pere has been made independent, with a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of its own. The other <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> are attached to the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> by which they were founded.

<p>In 1856 a new congregation of Norbertine canons, since incorporated with the order, was formed at <a href="../cathen/06307a.htm">Frigolet</a>. Frigolet founded Conques and St-Jean de Cole in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and Storrington and Weston-Bedworth in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> have jointly founded at Budapest a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> where young religious of these <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> study under Norbertine professors, and also follow the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> lectures in order to obtain the diploma required to become professors in one of the six colleges conducted by these <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a>. The order also possesses a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (Via di Monte Tarpeo) for Norbertine students at the Gregorian University. The <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> of the order resides at this college, of which he is also the <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>. At the death of L&eacute;cuy in 1834, the last Abbot General of Pr&eacute;montr&eacute;, the order was left without a spiritual head. In 1867 Jerome Zeidler, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Strahov, was elected, but he died in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> during the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>. At a general chapter held in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> in 1883 Sigismond Stary, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Strahov, was elected. At his death he was succeeded by Norbert Schachinger, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Schl&#228;gl, in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>.
<h2>Statistics</h2>

<p>The following statistics show the present state of the order in each circary.
