<h1>Presbytery</h1>  

<p>The part of the church reserved for the higher <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> was known in antiquity by various names, among them <em>presbyterium</em>, because of its occupation during the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> functions by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> attached to a church, arranged in a half-circle round the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. The presbytery was also known as <em>apsis, exedra, concha,</em> designations referring to its form; <em>bema</em> from the fact that it was elevated above the level of the <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">nave</a> and in consequence reached by a stairway of a few steps; <em>tribuna</em> because of its location and general resemblance to the tribunal in civil <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> whence the magistrates administered <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. These various names were, in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, mostly superseded by the term <em>choir</em>, which in turn yielded to the modern term sanctuary. The presbytery was separated from the rest of the church by rails (<em>cancelli</em>). <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a>, in his dedication oration at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> (<a href="../fathers/250110.htm"><em>Church History</em> X.4</a>), describes this feature of the church and its objects: "the Holy of Holies, the altar", he explains, was inclosed with wooden lattice-work, accurately wrought with artistic carving to render it "inaccessible to the multitude". In Constantinople, as appears from the episode related by Theodoret in which the actors were <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius the Great</a> and <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, the emperor was accustomed to remain within the precincts of the presbytery during the celebration of the liturgy, but in the West this was not permitted (<a href="../cathen/14574b.htm">Theodoret</a>, H.E., V, 17). The <a href="../cathen/04311b.htm">Council in Trullo</a> (canon lxix), following an ancient tradition, specifically excepts the emperor from the general rule reserving the presbytery to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. From this strict prohibition relative to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> the term <em>adyta</em> (inaccessible) came to be used of the presbytery. <em>Presbyterium</em> also denoted a body of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> taken collectively. In modern times the house of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> is frequently called the presbytery (<em>presbyt&egrave;re</em>).
