<h1>Presence of God</h1>  

<h2>Doctrinal</h2>

<p>All solid devotion and devotional practices must be founded upon the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and these <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> must be borne in mind when treating of the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from an ascetical and devotional point of view. First, it is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is present by His Essence everywhere and in all things by reason of His Immensity. (Creed of St. Athanasius; Council of Lateran, c. "Firmiter"; <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a>, Sess. III, c. 1.) It is also of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is in an especial manner really and substantially present in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just. This indwelling of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just is attributed by what <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> call appropriation to the Holy Ghost, but in reality it is common to the three Divine Persons.
<h2>Ascetical</h2>

<p>To put ourselves in the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or to live in the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as spiritual writers express it, means to become actually conscious of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as present, or at least so to live as though we were thus actually conscious. It is a simple act which involves the impression of the unseen Being with whom we have immediate relation and familiar converse, whose <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> towards us is assured, and who loves us with an everlasting <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; who exercises a particular providence among us, who is present everywhere and "who", in the words of <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a>, "is heart-reading, heart-changing, ever accessible and open to penetration" (Grammar of Assent, 112). The simple child as well as the advanced contemplative may thus represent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as present to the mind, and live in the consciousness of His presence. It is only the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and blessed who can <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">behold the face of God</a>.

<p>The servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or the devout <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be mindful of His presence in another way, namely, by the exercise of reason directed by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He sees <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the earth, the sea, the air and in all things; in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> where He manifests His glory, in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> where He carries out the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. He thinks of Him as present in all things within us and without us, and especially as dwelling secretly in his innermost <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, hidden from all our senses, yet speaking, as it were, to the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> with a voice that is in us but not of us; the voice of One who is with us yet over us.
<h2>Devotional</h2>

<p>One may therefore practise the devotion of living in the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: <ul> <li>by a lively <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in that Divine presence, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is near us and within us as Elias says: "the Lord liveth. . . in whose sight I stand" (<a href="../bible/1ki017.htm#vrs1">1 Kings 17:1</a>; cf. <a href="../bible/2ki003.htm#vrs14">2 Kings 3:14</a>); <li>when distracted the mind may be easily brought back to the remembrance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> presence by the simple reflection: "The Lord is here"; "The Lord sees me"; <li>when occupied with conversation or business by breathing from time to time some secret aspiration or affection for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and then keeping the mind recollected; <li>in dereliction of spirit, by keeping <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in mind more faithfully, knowing that nothing can come between Him and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, through which His special operation in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by grace ceases. Men may be said to come to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as they become more like Him in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>, and to withdraw from Him, when they become unlike Him by their wickedness. </ul> As the immediate preparation for <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, it is fitting and <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> "to place ourselves in the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>". This is to be done by an act of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Divine presence, from which should follow: <ul> <li>an act of adoration; <li>an act of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>; <li>an act of sorrow or contrition; <li>an act of petition for light and grace. </ul> These acts may be made in the interior of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.
