<h1>Presumption</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>praesumere</em>, "to take before", "to take for granted").

<p>Presumption is here considered as a vice opposed to the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> virtue of hope. It may also be regarded as a product of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. It may be defined as the condition of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which, because of a badly regulated reliance on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> mercy and power, hopes for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> without doing anything to deserve it, or for pardon of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> without repenting of them. Presumption is said to offend against hope by excess, as despair by defect. It will be obvious, however, to one who ponders what is meant by hope, that this statement is not exact. There is only a certain analogy which justifies it. As a matter of fact we could not hope too much, assuming that it is really the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> habit which is in question.

<p>Suarez ("De spe", disp. 2a, sect. 3, n. 2) enumerates five ways in which one may be guilty of presumption, as follows: <ol> <li>by hoping to obtain by one's natural powers, unaided, what is definitely <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, viz. <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal bliss</a> or the recovery of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> friendship after grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (this would involve a <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagian</a> frame of mind); <li>a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> might look to have his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> forgiven without adequate penance (this, likewise, if it were based on a seriously entertained conviction, would seem to carry with it the taint of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>); <li>a man might expect some special assistance from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> for the perpetration of crime (this would be blasphemous as well as presumptuous); <li>one might aspire to certain extraordinary <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> excellencies, but without any conformity to the determinations of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">God's providence</a>. Thus one might aspire to equal in blessedness the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>; <li>finally, there is the transgression of those who, whilst they continue to lead a life of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, are as confident of a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> issue as if they had not lost their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> innocence. </ol>

<p>The root-malice of presumption is that it denies the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>, as in the first instance, or travesties the conception of the <a href="../cathen/02062e.htm">Divine attributes</a>, as in the others. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> draw a sharp distinction between the attitude of one who goes on in a vicious career, precisely because he counts upon pardon, and one whose persistence in wrongdoing is accompanied, but not motivated, by the hope of forgiveness. The first they impeach as presumption of a very heinous kind; the other is not such specifically. In practice it happens for the most part that the expectation of ultimate reconciliation with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not the cause, but only the occasion, of a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> continuing in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> indulgence. Thus the particular guilt of presumption is not contracted.
