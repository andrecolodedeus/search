<h1>Priests' Communion League</h1>  

<p>An association of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> established at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> on 20 July, 1906, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Claudio, in charge of the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, and raised by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> to the dignity of an archconfraternity ten days later. Its object is to spread the practice of frequent and daily Communion among the faithful in conformity with the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Sacra Tridentina Synodus" of 20 December, 1905. The conditions for joining the league are: (1) To have one's name inscribed on the register of the league; (2) to pledge oneself (though under no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>) to promote <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> the observance of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> upon frequent and daily Communion by the apostolate of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, of preaching, and of the press; (3) to subscribe for the monthly periodical "Emmanuel", published by the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>. The members of the league begin their work by explaining to the people what the Eucharist is; when, how, wherefore, and with what <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it was instituted by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; what are its effects, whether considered as a sacrifice, as the real, perpetual <a href="../cathen/12396a.htm">presence of God</a> among us, and, above all, as the nourishment of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. They endeavour strenuously to dissipate the fear by which many of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are prevented from frequenting the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">Holy Table</a> and teach them that to communicate lawfully every day nothing more is exacted than what even yearly Communion requires, namely, the state of grace and a right intention, although it is desirable that they should be free also from deliberate venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. As the best means to spread the practice of daily Communion is daily attendance at Mass, they exhort the people to hear it every day. They should give their parishioners, during a period of not less than three days, a series of instructions dealing especially with the practice of and preparation for daily Communion. Members of the league take care to prepare children for the reception of <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> at an early age. Priests belonging to the league enjoy the right of a <a href="../cathen/01348c.htm">privileged altar</a> three times a week, provided they have not that right already; they may celebrate <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Mass</a> an hour before sunrise and an hour after midday, and may distribute <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> till sunset; they may gain a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> on all the first-class feasts of the mysteries of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of the Blessed Virgin, and the Apostles; and an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> of 300 days for every work they perform for the intention of the league; they may impart at the end of the triduum, after the general Communion, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> benediction with the plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> attached. Lastly, penitents confessing to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> enrolled in the league may gain a plenary <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> once a week, if accustomed to communicate very frequently.
