<h1>Primate</h1>  

<p>(Lat. <em>primas,</em> from <em>primus,</em> "first").

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Church</a> a primate is a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> possessing superior authority, not only over the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his own province, like the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, but over several provinces and <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a>. This does not refer to episcopal powers, which each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> possesses fully, but to <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> and organization, especially in national churches.

<p>Primates exist only in the West, and correspond not to the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a> but to the exarchs of the East. There is no uniformity in the institution, it has no place in <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a>; primatial <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> are privileges. In their widest acceptation these <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> would be: to convoke and preside over national councils, to crown the sovereign, to hear appeals from the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> and even episcopal courts, and finally the honorary right of precedence.

<p>This organization formerly useful, as it favoured and maintained unity in national churches, has lost its importance and disappeared; first, because national Churches as such no longer exist, and secondly on account of the gradual disciplinary centralization of the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">Western Churches</a> around the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>. Except in the case of <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a> in <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, the primatial title is merely honorific. At the solemnities accompanying the <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09744a.htm">Japanese martyrs</a> in 1867, no special place was reserved for primates; and in the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> the precedence of primates was recognized only at the insistance of the Prince-Primate of <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> (<a href="../cathen/15354a.htm">Vering</a>, "Kirchenrecht", &#167; 133), as something exceptional and not to be considered a precedent. The <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> "Inter multiplices", 27 November, 1869 (<a href="../cathen/01111c.htm">Acta S. Sedis</a>, V, 235), ranks the primates according to their date of promotion after the <a href="../cathen/11549a.htm">patriarchs</a>, but adds: Ex special indulgentia, i.e. by special favour, for that occasion only, nor must it be interpreted as conferring any right on them or diminishing the right of others.

<p>The history of the primacies in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> is largely concerned with interminable disputes concerning special <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, privileges, etc. The real primacies were at first those that did not bear the name. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> exercised a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> primatial <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over the provinces of Roman Africa, without being called a primate; on the other hand, in the provinces, other than the Proconsular, the oldest <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who resembled a <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a>, was called the primate. The title Primate of Africa was restored again in 1893 by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in favour of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Toledo was also a primate for the <a href="../cathen/15476b.htm">Visigothic</a> kingdom. On the other hand, the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/14633a.htm">Thessalonica</a> and Arles, invested with the vicariate of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, had authority over several provinces. We meet later with claims to primatial authority in every country, and refusals to recognize these claims; the primates who have exercised a real authority being especially those of Mayenne, the successors of <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, made by <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a>, Primate of the Gauls, in reality of the provinces called formerly "Laughmenses". All kinds of reasons were invoked: the evangelization of the country, the importance of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a>, pontifical concessions, etc.

<p>It is impossible to give more than the mere names of primacies: in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, Toledo, Compostella, Braga; in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, <a href="../cathen/12725a.htm">Reims</a>, <a href="../cathen/02720b.htm">Bourges</a>, Vienne, Narbonne, <a href="../cathen/02682a.htm">Bordeaux</a>, Rouen; in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Mayenne, <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, Magdeburg; in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>, York; in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, St. Andrews; in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, Armagh; in the Scandinavian countries, Lund. But of all these nothing but a title has remained; and at the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> the only <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> figuring as primates, in virtue of recent concessions, were those of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/01582b.htm">Antivari</a>, <a href="../cathen/13396b.htm">Salerno</a>, <a href="../cathen/13466a.htm">Bahia</a>, Gnesen, <a href="../cathen/14459a.htm">Tarragona</a>, <a href="../cathen/06721b.htm">Gran</a>, <a href="../cathen/10104a.htm">Mechlin</a>, and Armagh (Coll. Lacens., VII, pp. 34, 488, 726).
