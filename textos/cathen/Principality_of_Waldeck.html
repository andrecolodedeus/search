<h1>Principality of Waldeck</h1>  

<p>(Or WALDECK-PYRMONT).

<p>A former state of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, with an area of 433 square miles; in 1910 it had 61,723 inhabitants; in 1905, 59,127. The principality consisted of two parts: <ul><li>the southern principality, called Waldeck, surrounded by the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Provinces of Hesse-Nassau and <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalia</a>, and having an area of 407 square miles, with a population, in 1905, of 49,965; <li>the northern principality, called Pyrmont, surrounded by the Principality of Lippe, the <a href="../cathen/03019a.htm">Duchy of Brunswick</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Province of <a href="../cathen/07127c.htm">Hanover</a>, with an area of 26 square miles and a population, in 1905, of 9162.</ul> The entire principality contained, in 1905: 56,341 <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>; 1890, or 2 per cent, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; and 629 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The country is named from the fortified castle of Waldeck situated on the Eider, a western branch of the <a href="../cathen/06313b.htm">Fulda</a>. About 1150 Widukind V of Schwalenberg took the castle and called himself Count of Waldeck. From 1438 Waldeck was a fief of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a>, a relation virtually dissolved by the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806, and finally in 1846 by a decision of the Diet of the German Confederation. In 1631, when the Countship of Gleichen became extinct, the Countship of Pyrmont fell to Waldeck. In the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1866, between <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, Waldeck supported <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> and entered the North German Confederation. The administration was transferred to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> by the Treaty of Accession of 1867. In 1877 this treaty was renewed for ten years, and in 1887 for an indefinite period, subject to two years' notice of abrogation. Prince Friedrich (b. 1865) became the ruler in 1893.

<p>Before the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">great religious schism</a> of the sixteenth century Waldeck belonged in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters partly to the <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Archdiocese of Cologne</a>, partly to the <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Diocese of Paderborn</a>, while scattered <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> also belonged to the <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Archdiocese of Mainz</a>. The new <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> was introduced into the country in 1527-43 by Count Philip III. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a> was maintained longest in the town of Korbach (until 1543). A portion of the Countship of D&uuml;dinghausen, consisting of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Ebbe with the townships of Hillershausen and Niederschleidern, was annexed by an agreement with its <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> lord, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>. Thus Waldeck once more had a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>. Even now, the townships of Ebbe and Hillershausen are almost entirely, while Niederschleidern is still half, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">ecclesiastical jurisdiction</a> over the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Ebbe was retained by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, but in 1821 the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "De salute animarum" transferred it to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>. Waldeck received another <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in 1900, that of Arolsen, a settlement established by Prince Friedrich Anton Ulrich. A third <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, Korbach, was formed in 1911.

<p>The Principality of Pyrmont was in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> a fief of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>. It became entirely <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>. Towards the end of the eighteenth century <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> from L&uuml;dge held missions there during the season of the year when it was frequented as a watering-place. In 1853 the State permitted regular Sunday services, and in 1861 the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Pyrmont was formed. Before appointing a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had to present the name of one candidate to the Government of Waldeck, or, in the case of Arolsen, the names of two candidates. The Government had the right of objecting to each appointment. The candidate had to swear to observe the Constitution of Waldeck. The stipends of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were paid out of the revenue of the church fund, the church taxes, and allowances made by the Government and the prince.

<p>The houses of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> orders are: <ul><li>at Arolsen an institution for preparing communicants called the St. Marienstift, conducted by Sisters of St. Vincent from <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a>; <li>at Bad Wildungen, a lodging-house and sanitarium, called St. Liboriushaus, conducted by <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Nuns; <li>in Pyrmont, St. Georgstift conducted by <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Nuns.</ul> There are no male orders, nor are there any state <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as to the admission of orders. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> community is increased in summer by the numerous Polish agricultural labourers and in Pyrmont and Bad Wildungen by a large number of visitors for the cures. Historically, the public primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a>. In places where there was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> minority, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> could demand the opening of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> public <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at the public expense, if for the previous ten years there had been on an average at least fifty <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> children of school-age. There have been three <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> since the middle of the seventeenth century: at Ebbe, in 1910, at Hillershausen, and at Niederschleidern. In 1911 there was added to these three the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at Arolsen, which was founded in 1845 and had been until 1911 a private <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in Pyrmont opened a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in 1882. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> primary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> opened in Korbach in 1911.
