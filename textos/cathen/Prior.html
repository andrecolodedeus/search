<h1>Prior</h1>  

<p>A monastic superior. In the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a> the term <em>prior</em> occurs several times, but does does not signify any particular superior; it is indiscriminately applied to any superior, be he <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, dean, etc. In other old monastic rules the term is used in the same generic sense. With the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> reform the term prior received a specific meaning; it supplanted the <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> (<em>praepositus</em>) of the <a href="../cathen/02436a.htm">Rule of St. Benedict</a>. In the congregation of Hirschau, which arose in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> in the eleventh century, the term prior was also substituted for <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, and the example of the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> and Hirschau congregations was gradually followed by all <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, as well as by the <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a>, Vallombrosians, <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a>, and other offshoots of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a> and its branches, in the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian Order</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a> there are two kinds of priors, &#151; the claustral prior (<em>prior claustralis</em>) and the conventual prior (<em>prior conventualis</em>). The claustral prior, in a few <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> called dean, holds the first place after the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> (or grand-master in <a href="../cathen/10304d.htm">military orders</a>), whom he assists in the government of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and whose place he supplies in his absence. He has no ordinary <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> by virtue of his office, since he performs the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office entirely according to the will and under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. His <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> is, therefore, a delegated one and extends just as far as the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> desires, or the constitutions of the congregation prescribe. He is appointed by the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, generally after a consultation with the capitulars of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and may be removed by him at any time. In many <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, especially larger ones, the claustral prior is assisted by a subprior, who holds the third place in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In former times there were in larger <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, besides the prior and the subprior, also a third, fourth, and sometimes even a fifth prior. Each of these was called <em>circa</em> (or <em>circator</em>), because it was his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to make the rounds of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> to see whether anything was amiss and whether the brethren were intent on the work allotted to them respectively. He had no authority to correct or punish the brethren, but was to report to the claustral prior whatever he found amiss or contrary to the rules.

<p>The <em>conventual prior</em> is the independent superior of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> that has no <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>; he rules in temporals and spirituals just like an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Ordinarily he is elected by the chapter of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and holds his office for life, though in former times he was often elected for a specified period of <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a>. He may be assisted by a subprior, whose office is similar to that of the claustral prior in an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Congregation of Cluny</a> and others of the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries there was also a greater prior (<em>prior major</em>) who preceded the claustral prior in dignity and, besides assisting the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> in the government of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, had some delegated <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over external dependencies of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. The appellation of simple, or <a href="../cathen/11183a.htm">obedientiary</a> prior (<em>prior simplex</em> or <em>prior obedientiarius</em>) is often applied to the superior of a monastic establishment which is a dependency of an <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. He is an <a href="../cathen/11183a.htm">obedientiary</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>, is appointed by him, and may be removed by him at any time.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07281a.htm">Augustinian Hermits</a>, <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, <a href="../cathen/09750a.htm">Servites</a>, and Brothers of Mercy have three kinds of priors &mdash; the conventual prior, the provincial prior, and the prior general. The conventual prior is the first superior over a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. He is generally elected by the chapter of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for a specified time, and his election requires the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the provincial prior. The provincial prior is the superior over a number of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> that are united into a province. He is generally elected for a specified time by the conventual priors and delegates from the various <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the province, and his election requires the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the prior general. The prior general is the superior over the whole order; he is elected in the general chapter for a specified time and resides in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> also have conventual and provincial priors, but the superior of the whole order is not called prior general, but master general. The <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusians</a> have conventual priors and a prior general, but no provincial priors. Their prior general is the only superior of an order who does not reside in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Before their suppression in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> the prior of the Grande Chartreuse was always prior general, an office now filled by the prior of Farneta near Lucca in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. In all these orders the second superior of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is called subprior and his office is similar to that of the claustral prior in the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>.
