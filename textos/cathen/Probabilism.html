<h1>Probabilism</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> is the moral system which holds that, when there is question solely of the lawfulness or unlawfulness of an action, it is permissible to follow a solidly probable opinion in favour of liberty even though the opposing view is more probable.
<h2 id="section1">State of the question</h2>

<p>When a prohibiting law is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a>, the subjects of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> are bound to abstain from performing the action which the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> forbids, unless they are excused by one of the ordinary exempting causes. On the other hand, when it is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that no law forbids an action, there is no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to abstain from performing it. Between these two extremes there can be varying degrees of uncertainty about the existence or cessation of a prohibiting law. There is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in the strict sense when the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> neither assents nor dissents, because either there are no positive arguments for and against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, or the arguments for and against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> are equal in strength. The opinion which favours the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and which is technically called the safe opinion, can be more probable than the opinion which favours liberty and which still retains solid probability. Again, the opinion which favours the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> can be most probable, and the opinion which favours liberty only slightly probable. In the same way the opinion which favours liberty and which is technically called the less safe opinion, can be more probable than the opposing view, or can be most probable.

<p>In estimating the degree which is required and which suffices for solid probability, <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moralists</a> lay down the general principle that <em>an opinion is solidly probable which by reason of intrinsic or extrinsic arguments is able to gain the assent of many prudent men.</em> All admit that extrinsic authority can have sufficient weight to make an opinion solidly probable; but there is divergence of view in estimating what number of experts is able to give an opinion this solid probability. The prevailing theory amongst Probabilists holds that if five or six <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, notable for <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and learning, independently adhere to an opinion their view is solidly probable, if it has not been set aside by authoritative decisions or by intrinsic arguments which they have failed to solve. Even one <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a> of very exceptional authority, such as <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Liguori</a>, is able to make an opinion solidly probable, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from the official declarations of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. All <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moralists</a> agree that mere flimsy reasons are insufficient to give an opinion solid probability, and also that the support of many <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> who are mere collectors of the opinions of others is unable to give solid probability to the view which they maintain.

<p>Non-Catholics who bring charges of laxity against the moral systems which <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> uphold, often forget that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in theory and in practice, has condemned various views in favour of liberty which are based on insufficient data.

<p><em>If the less safe opinion is speculatively uncertain it is unlawful to follow it in practice, until all reasonable effort has been made to remove the uncertainty, by considering the arguments on both sides and by consulting available authorities. It is unlawful, also, to act on the less safe view unless the speculative uncertainty has been changed into practical <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that the action to be performed is lawful.</em> The whole question at issue between different moral systems concerns the way in which the speculative uncertainty is changed into practical <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>; each system has what is called a reflex principle of its own, by which practical <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> can be obtained that the action to be performed is lawful. <ul> <li><em>Rigorism</em>, or, as it is frequently called, <em>Tutiorism</em> held that the less safe opinion should be most probable, if not absolutely certain, before it could be lawfully put into practice, while <li><em>Laxism</em> maintained that if the less safe opinion were slightly probable it could be followed with a safe <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. </ul>

<p>These two views, however, never received serious support from <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, and were formally condemned by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. At one time or another in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> three other opinions gained many adherents. <ul> <li>Some <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, who put forward the system known as <em>Probabiliorism</em>, hold that the less safe opinion can be lawfully followed only when it is more probable than the safe opinion. <li>Others, upholding <em>&AElig;quiprobabilism</em>, maintain that, when the uncertainty concerns the existence of a law, it is lawful to follow the less safe opinion when it has equal or almost equal probability with the safe opinion, but that, when there is question of the cessation of a law, the less safe opinion cannot lawfully be followed unless it is more probable than the safe view. <li>Others again, who adhere to <em><a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a></em>, believe that, whether there is question of the existence or of the cessation of a law, it is lawful to act on the less safe opinion if it is solidly probable, even though the safe view is certainly more probable. <li>In recent years a system known as <em>Compensationism</em> has tried to reconcile these three opinions by holding that not only the degree of probability attaching to various opinions must be taken into account, but also the importance of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and the degree of utility attaching to the performance of the action whose morality is in question. The more important the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, and the smaller the degree of probability attaching to the less safe opinion, the greater must be the compensating utility which will permit the performance of the action of which the lawfulness is uncertain. </ul> From what has so far been said it is clear that these various moral systems come into play only when the question concerns the lawfulness of an action. If the uncertainty concerns the validity of an action which must certainly be valid, it is not lawful to act on mere probability unless, indeed, this is of such a nature as to make the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> certainly supply what is needed for the validity of the act. Thus, apart from necessity, it is not lawful to act on mere probability when the validity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is in question. Again, it is not lawful to act on mere probability when there is question of gaining an end which is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a>, since certain means must be employed to gain a certainly required end. Hence, when <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is at stake, it is not lawful to be content with uncertain means. Moreover, the virtue of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> demands equality, and as such excludes the use of probability when the established <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of another are concerned. Consequently, if a certain <a href="../cathen/04663b.htm">debt</a> has not been certainly paid, at least a payment <em>pro rata dubii </em>is required according to the prevailing view. It is evident, then, that the question which arises in connection with the moral systems has to do solely with the lawfulness or unlawfulness of an action.


<h2 id="section2">History of probabilism</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> as a moral system had no history prior to the end of the sixteenth century. Fathers, <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at times solved cases on principles which apparently were probabilist in tendency. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> declared that marriage with infidels was not to be regarded as unlawful since it was not clearly condemned in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>: "Quoniam revera in Novo Testamento nihil inde praeceptum est, et ideo aut licere creditum est, aut velut dubium derelictum" ("De Fide et Operibus", c. xix, n. 35 in "P.L.", XL, 221). <a href="../cathen/07010b.htm">St. Gregory of Nazianzus</a> laid down, against a <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> writer, that a second marriage was not unlawful, since the prohibition was <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>: "Quo argumento id confirmas. Aut rem ita esse proba, aut, si id nequis, ne condemnes. Quod si res dubia est, vincat humanitas et facilitas" (Or. 39, "In sancta Lumina", n. 19 in "P.G.", XXXVI, 358). <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> maintained that a precept does not bind except through the medium of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: "Unde nullus ligatur per praeceptum aliquod nisi mediante scientia illius" ("De Veritate", Q. xvii, a. 3); and Probabilists are accustomed to point out that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> implies <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>.

<p>On the other hand many <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> were Probabiliorist in their principles before the sixteenth century. Sylvester Prierias (Opinio, s. 2), Conradus (De Contract., Q. ult), and Cajetan (Opinio) were Probabiliorists; so that Probabiliorism had gained a strong hold on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> when Medina arrived on the scene. Bartholomew Medina, a <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, was the first to expound the moral system which is known as <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>. In his "Expositio in 1am 2ae S. Thomae" he taught that, "if an opinion is probable it is lawful to follow it, even though the opposing opinion is more probable". His system soon became the common teaching of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, so that in the introduction to his "Regula Morum" <a href="../cathen/14517b.htm">Father Terill, S.J.</a>* (d. 1676) was able to say that until 1638 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of all <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> were Probabilists. There were exceptions such as Rebellus (d. 1608), Comitolus (d. 1626), and Philalethis (d. 1642), but the great body of the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the end of the sixteenth and of the first half of the seventeenth century were on the side of Medina. Amongst them were <a href="../cathen/13285a.htm">Sa</a> (d. 1596), Toletus* (d. 1596), <a href="../cathen/07021b.htm">Gregorius de Valentia</a> (d. 1603), <a href="../cathen/02247a.htm">Ba&ntilde;ez</a> (d. 1604), Vasquez (d. 1604), Azor (d. 1607), Thomas Sanchez (d. 1610), Ledesma (d. 1616), Francisco Su&aacute;rez (d. 1617), <a href="../cathen/09192a.htm">Lessius</a> (d. 1623), Laymann (d. 1625), Bonacina (d. 1631), Castropalaus (d. 1633), Alvarez (d. 1635), and Ildephonsus (d. 1639).

<p>With the rise of <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> and the condemnation of "Augustinus" a new phase in the history of the Probabilist controversies began. In 1653 <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> condemned the five propositions taken from "Augustinus", and in 1655 the <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> condemned <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>. Tutiorism was adopted by the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenists</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, Sinnichius (d. 1666), a professor of <a href="../cathen/09391a.htm">Louvain</a>, was the foremost defender of the Rigorist doctrines. He held that it is not lawful to follow even a most probable opinion in favour of liberty. <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist Rigorism</a> spread into <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11511a.htm">Pascal</a> in his "Lettres Provinciales" attacked <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> with the vigour and grace of style which have given his letters their high place in literature. The "Lettres Provinciales" were condemned by <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> in 1657, but Rigorism did not receive its final blow till the year 1690 when <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Alexander VIII</a> condemned the proposition of Sinnichius: "Non licet sequi opinionem vel inter probabiles probabilissimam ".

<p>After this condemnation a moderate form of Tutiorism was unfolded by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> like Steyaert (d. 1701), Opstraet (d. 1720), Henricus a S. Ignatio (d. 1719), and <a href="../cathen/04733a.htm">Dens</a> (d. 1775). During this period, dating from the middle of the seventeenth to the middle of the eighteenth century, the following were amongst the notable <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> who remained true to <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>: Lugo (d. 1660), <a href="../cathen/09436c.htm">Lupus</a> (d. 1681), Cardenas (d. 1684), Deschamps (d. 1701), Lacroix* (d. 1714), Sporer (d. 1714), <a href="../cathen/13401c.htm">Salmanticenses</a> (1717-1724), Mazzotta (d. 1748).

<p>Side by side with <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> and Rigorism a party held sway which favoured Laxism, and which maintained in theory or practice that a slightly probable opinion in favour of liberty could safely be followed. The principal upholders of this view were Juan Sanchez (d. 1620), <a href="../cathen/02352b.htm">Bauny</a> (d. 1649) Leander (d. 1663), Diana (d. 1663), <a href="../cathen/14441a.htm">Tamburini</a> (d. 1675), <a href="../cathen/03329c.htm">Caramuel</a> (d. 1682), Moya (d. 1684). Laxism was expressly condemned by <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> in 1679; and <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> (1665-66), and <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> (1679) condemned various propositions which savoured of Laxism.

<p>Besides Rigorism, <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>, and Laxism, there was also a theory of Probabiliorism which held that it is not lawful to act on the less safe opinion unless it is more probable than the safe opinion. This view, which was in vogue before the time of Medina, was renewed in the middle of the seventeenth century, as an antidote against Laxism. Its revival was principally due to the efforts of <a href="../cathen/01294a.htm">Alexander VII</a> and <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>. In 1656 a general chapter of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> urged all members of the order to adopt Probabiliorism. Though previously <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> like Medina, Ledesma, <a href="../cathen/02247a.htm">Ba&ntilde;ez</a>, Alvarez, and Ildephonsus were Probabilists subsequently the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> in the main were Probabiliorists. Amongst them were Mercorius (d. 1669), <a href="../cathen/06634a.htm">Gonet</a> (d. 1681), <a href="../cathen/04330a.htm">Contenson</a> (d. 1674), Fagnanus (d. 1678), Natalis Alexander (d. 1724), <a href="../cathen/04191a.htm">Concina</a> (d. 1756), Billuart (d. 1757), Patuzzi (d. 1769). Probabiliorism was held by many <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> such as Gonzalez (d. 1705), Elizalde (d. 1678), Antoine* (d. 1743), Ehrentreich (d. 1708), and Taberna (d. 1686). In 1700 the Gallican <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, under <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a>, accepted Probabiliorism. The <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> as a rule were Probabiliorists, and in 1762 a general chapter of the order, held at <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, ordered the members to follow Probabiliorism. In 1598 a general chapter of the <a href="../cathen/14557a.htm">Theatines</a> adopted Probabiliorism. The Augustinians, the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, the Trinitarians, and many <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a> were also Probabiliorists. The most notable event in the history of the controversy occurred in connection with Thyrsus Gonzalez, S.J., a professor of Salamanca, who (1670-72) wrote a work, entitled "Fundamentum Theologiae Moralis", in favour of Probabiliorism. In 1673 the book was sent to the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> General Oliva, who refused permission for its publication. <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> favoured Gonzalez, and in 1680 sent, through the Holy Office, a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> to the General Oliva ordering that liberty be given to the members of the order to write in favour of Probabiliorism and against <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>. Gonzalez was elected general of the order in 1687, but his book was not published until 1694.

<p>During the controversies between the Probabilists and the Probabiliorists, the system known as &AElig;quiprobabilism was not clearly brought into prominence. &AElig;quiprobabilism holds that it is not lawful to follow the less safe opinion when the safe opinion is certainly more probable; that it is not lawful to act on the less safe opinion even when it is equally probable with the safe opinion, if the uncertainty regards the cessation of a law; but that if the existence of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is in question, it is lawful to follow the less safe opinion if it has equal or nearly equal probability with the safe opinion. Many of the moderate Probabilists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries foreshadowed in their writings the theory to which, in his later-days, <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus</a> adhered. Even Francisco Su&aacute;rez, who is regarded as a typical Probabilist, said: "Major probabilitas est quaedam moralis certitudo, si excessus probabilitatis certus est (De Legibus, 1. VIII, c. 3, n. 19). In the beginning of the eighteenth century Amort. (d. 1775), Rassler (d. 1730), and Mayr (d. 1749), who are sometimes classed as moderate Probabilists, in reality defended &AElig;quiprobabilism.

<p>This view gained vigour and persistence from the teaching of St. Alphonsus, who began his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> career as a Probabiliorist, subsequently defended <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>, especially in a treatise entitled "Dissertatio scholastico-moralis pro usu moderato opinionis probabilis in concursu probabilioris" (1749, 1755), and finally, about 1762, embraced &AElig;quiprobabilism. In a new dissertation he laid down the two propositions that it is lawful to act on the less safe opinion, when it is equally probable with the safe opinion, and that it is not lawful to follow the less safe opinion when the safe opinion is notably and certainly more probable. In the sixth edition (1767) of his "Moral Theology" he again expressed these views and indeed towards the end of his life frequently declared that he was not a Probabilist.

<p>Probabilists sometimes hold that St. Alphonsus never changed his opinion once he had discarded Probabiliorism for <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>, though he changed his manner of expressing his view so as to exclude Laxist teaching and to give an indication of what must be regarded as a solidly probable opinion. As a matter of fact, as can be seen from a comparison between the "Moral Theologies" of moderate Probabilists and of &AElig;quiprobabilists, there is little practical difference between the two systems, so far at least as the uncertainty regards the existence as distinguished from the cessation of a law. Since the time of St. Alphonsus the prevailing moral systems have been <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> and &AElig;quiprobabilism. Probabiliorism has to a great extent disappeared, and even many <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> have espoused the cause of &AElig;quiprobabilism. During the nineteenth century the principal &AElig;quiprobabilists have been <a href="../cathen/08689b.htm">Konings</a>, Marc, Aertnys, Ter Haar, de Caigny, Gaude, and <a href="../cathen/15715a.htm">Wouters</a>. Quite recently Ter Haar and <a href="../cathen/15715a.htm">Wouters</a> have been engaged in controversy with Lehmkuhl who, especially In his "Probabilismus Vindicatus" (1906) and in the eleventh edition of his "Theologia Moralis" (1910), has strongly supported the Probabilist thesis which has been accepted during the nineteenth century by the vast majority of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>.

<p>In late years the system of Compensationism has arisen, which holds that a compensating reason proportionate to the gravity of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and to the degree of probability in favour of the existence of the law, is required in order that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> might lawfully act on the less safe opinion. This theory was proposed by Mannier, Laloux, and Potton; but it has gained little support and has not yet become a rival of the old theories of <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>, &AElig;quiprobabilism, or even Probabiliorism.
<h2 id="section3">Probabilism</h2>
<h3 id="A">Teaching of probabilists</h3>

<p>The central <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> is that in every <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> which concerns merely the lawfulness or unlawfulness of an action it is permissible to follow a solidly probable opinion in favour of liberty, even though the opposing view is more probable. Probabilists apply their theory only when there is question merely of the lawfulness or unlawfulness of an action, because in other cases <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> might be demanded on various grounds, as happens when the validity of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, the attainment of an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> end, and the established <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of another are concerned. They apply their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> whether the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about the lawfulness or unlawfulness of an action be a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of law, or a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of fact which can be reduced to a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of law. Thus if it is solidly probable that Friday morning has not yet set in, there is a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of fact which can be reduced to a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of law as to whether it is lawful in the circumstances to take meat. They also apply their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> not merely to human but also to Divine and natural <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> on the ground that the Divine legislator is not more exacting than a human legislator. They apply their principles whether the existence or the cessation of a law is concerned, since, in their estimation, liberty is always in possession. They also apply their <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> even though the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> whose action is in question believes that the safe opinion is the more probable opinion. If, however, he looks on the safe opinion as morally certain, he cannot lawfully use the opinion of others who differ from him. Nor can a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> on the same occasion use opposing probabilities in his favour in reference to several <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of which one or another would be certainly violated; thus a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> cannot lawfully take meat on the probability that Friday has already elapsed, and at the same time postpone the reading of <a href="../cathen/04187a.htm">Compline</a> on the probability that Friday will not elapse for some time. Finally, Probabilists insist that the opinion in favour of liberty must be based on solid arguments and not on mere flimsy reasons which are insufficient to gain the assent of prudent men.
<h3 id="B">Arguments for probabilism</h3>

<p><em>(1) External arguments</em>

<p>(a) <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>, if <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">untrue</a>, is seriously detrimental to the spiritual life of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, since it permits actions which ought to be forbidden, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot tolerate or give approval to such a moral system. But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> during many centuries has tolerated <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>, and has given it approval in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of St. Alphonsus. Hence <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> is not a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> system of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. That the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has tolerated <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> is shown from the numerous approved authors, who, since the time of Medina, have defended it without interference on the part of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. That the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has given positive approval to <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of St. Alphonsus is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from the fact that his works including his treatises in favour of <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>, received official sanction from the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 18 May, 1803, the reply of the Sacred Penitentiary of 5 July, 1831 the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of Canonization of 26 May, 1839 and the Apostolic Letters of 7 July, 1871 (cf. Lehmkuhl, "Theologia Moralis", I, nn. 165-75).

<p>&AElig;quiprobabilists reply that this argument proves too much for Probabilists, since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has also tolerated &AElig;quiprobabilism, and has given it positive approval in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of St. Alphonsus, whose works in favour of &AElig;quiprobabilism received the sanction of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> in the official documents of 1803, 1831, 1839, and 1871. If &AElig;quiprobabilism is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, it is seriously detrimental to the spiritual life of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, since it imposes burdens which ought not to be imposed. Hence, if any argument can be derived for <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> from the toleration or approval of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, a similar argument can be derived therefrom for &AElig;quiprobabilism.

<p>(b) In interpreting her own <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> applies the principles of <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>, since amongst the rules of law in "Sexto Decretalium" we read: "Odia restringi, et favores convenit ampliari" (r. 15); "In obscuris minimum est sequendum" (r. 30); "Contra eum qui legem dicere potuit apertius, est interpretatio facienda" (r. 57); "In poenis benignior est interpretatio facienda" (r. 89). What is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is equally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of other legislators, because <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not a more exacting Legislator than His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, nor is the State to be presumed more strict than <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (cf. Tanquerey, "Theologia Moralis fundamentalis", n. 413).

<p>&AElig;quiprobabilists reply to this argument that when the less safe opinion is certainly less probable than the safe opinion, the former has lost solid probability and consequently cannot, so far as <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is concerned, obtain the privileges which the Divine Legislator, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the State concede in the case of really <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Moreover, many of these rules of law directly apply to the external forum and ought not, without due limitation, be transferred to the forum of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.

<p><em>(2) Internal arguments</em>

<p>(a) A law which has not been <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> is not a law in the full and strict sense, and does not impose an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. But when there is a solidly probable opinion in favour of liberty, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has not been sufficiently <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, since there has not been the requisite manifestation of the mind of the legislator. Hence when there is a solidly probable opinion in favour of liberty, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not a law in the full and strict sense, and does not impose any <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> (cf. Lehmkuhl, "Theologia Moralis", I, nn. 176-8).

<p>&AElig;quiprobabilists reply that when there is a solidly probable opinion in favour of liberty, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is probably not sufficiently <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, and the question remains whether a law that is probably not sufficiently <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> imposes any <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. It would be begging the question to assume that no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is imposed simply because there is a probability that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> has not been sufficiently <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>. Moreover, if the safe opinion happens to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> opinion, a material <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed by the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who, acting on probability, performs the prohibited action. But, unless the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a>, a material <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot be committed by its violation, since <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgation</a> is a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> condition of a binding law (cf. McDonald, "The Principles of Moral Science", p. 245).

<p>(b) An <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, concerning whose existence there is invincible <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, is no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>. But, so long as there is a solidly probable opinion in favour of liberty, there is invincible <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> about the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> imposed by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. Hence a law does not impose an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> so long as the less safe opinion is solidly probable (cf. Lehmkuhl, "Theologia Moralis", I, n. 179).

<p>&AElig;quiprobabilists reply that there is not invincible <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in regard to a law when the safe opinion is also the more probable opinion, because in these circumstances a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is bound by ordinary <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> to give assent to the safe opinion. Although it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> concerning whose existence there is invincible <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> when one is compelled to give assent to an opinion as the more probable opinion (cf. <a href="../cathen/15715a.htm">Wouters</a>, "De Minusprobabilismo", p. 121).

<p>(c) According to the axiom: lex dubia non obligat, a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> law does not bind. But a law is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> when there is a solidly probable opinion against it. Hence it is lawful to follow a solidly probable opinion in favour of liberty (cf. Tanquerey, "Theologia Fundamentalis", n. 409).

<p>&AElig;quiprobabilists in reply say that the axiom <em>lex dubia non obligat</em> holds when the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is strictly <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a>, i.e. when the reasons for and against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> are equal or nearly equal. A fortiori the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not bind when the safe opinion is more probable than the less safe opinion. It would, however, be begging the question to assume that the axiom holds when the less safe opinion is clearly less probable than the safe opinion.

<p>(d) According to &AElig;quiprobabilists, it is lawful to follow the less safe opinion, when it is more probable than the safe opinion. But they must admit that <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> is more probable than &AElig;quiprobabilism, since the vast majority of <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> favour the milder view, and &AElig;quiprobabilists do not reject external authority. Hence on their own principles they ought to admit the practical <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>.

<p>&AElig;quiprobabilists reply that extrinsic authority is of no avail when the arguments on which the authority rests have been proved to be invalid; and they claim that they have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the invalidity of the Probabilist arguments. Moreover a reflex principle is useless unless its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, since its sole utility is to change speculative uncertainty into practical <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. But greater probability does not give <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. Accordingly, even if &AElig;quiprobabilists were to admit the greater probability of <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>, that admission would be useless for Probabilists. The case is different with &AElig;quiprobabilism which has practical <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, since nearly all <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> nowadays admit the lawfulness of following the less safe opinion regarding the existence of a law, when it is equally or almost equally probable with the safe opinion.

<p>(e) Many Probabilists lay stress on a practical argument in favour of their opinion, which is derived from the difficulty of distinguishing between various grades of Probability. It is impossible in practice, especially for ordinary people, to tell when one solidly probable opinion is more probable than another solidly probable opinion. But a moral system, to be of any serious utility, must be universal, so that not merely experts in moral <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> but also ordinary people can utilize it. Hence the systems which demand a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the various degrees of probability must be discarded as practically useless, and <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> alone must be accepted as a working system.

<p>&AElig;quiprobabilists reply that their system merely asks, that if after due investigation it is found that the less safe opinion is notably and certainly less probable than the safe opinion, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> must be observed. The <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> investigation has frequently been already made by experts, and others, who are not experts, are safe in accepting the conclusions to which the experts adhere.
<h3 id="C">Arguments against probabilism</h3>

<p>In addition to some arguments to be explained in connection with the other modern moral systems, it is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to mention a few difficulties which have been urged directly against <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>.

<p>(1) When the less safe opinion is notably and certainly less probable than the safe opinion, there is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> probability in favour of liberty, since the stronger destroy the force of the weaker reasons. Hence Probabilists cannot consistently maintain that it is safe in practice to act on the less safe opinion which is also the less probable.

<p>Probabilists reply that the greater probability does not of necessity destroy the solid probability of the less probable opinion. When the foundations of the opposing probabilities are not derived from the same source, then at least the opposing arguments do not detract from one another; and even when the two probabilities are based on a consideration of the same argument, one opinion will retain probability in so far as the opposing opinion recedes from <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>.

<p>(2) A moral system, to be of any use, must be certain, since an uncertain reflex principle cannot give practical <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. But <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> is not certain, because it is rejected by all those <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> who upheld one or another of the opposing views. Hence <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> cannot be accepted as a satisfactory solution of the question at issue.

<p>Probabilists reply that their system can be of no use to those who do not look on it as certainly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but the fact that many <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> do not accept it does not prevent its adherents from regarding it as certain, since these can and do believe that the arguments urged in its favour are insuperable.

<p>(3) <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> is an easy road to Laxism, because people are often inclined to regard opinions as really probable which are based on flimsy arguments, and because it is not difficult to find five or six serious authors who approve of opinions which right-minded men consider lax. The only sure way to safeguard <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a> is to reject the opinion which opens the way to Laxism.

<p>Probabilists reply that their system must be prudently employed, and that no serious danger of Laxism arises if it is recognized that an opinion is not solidly probable unless there are arguments in its favour which are sufficient to gain the assent of many prudent men. As for the authority of approved authors, it must be remembered that five or six grave authors do not give solid probability to an opinion unless they are notable for learning and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and independently adhere to an opinion which has not been set aside by authoritative decisions or by unanswered arguments.
<h2 id="section4">Moral systems opposed to probabilism</h2>
<h3 id="A">&AElig;quiprobabilism</h3>

<p>This system can be expressed in the three following propositions: <ul> <li>The opinions for and against the existence of a law having equal or nearly equal probabilities, it is permissible to act on the less safe opinion. <li>The opinions for and against the cessation of a law having equal or nearly equal probabilities, it is not permissible to act on the less safe opinion. <li>The safe opinion being certainly more probable than the less safe opinion, it is unlawful to follow the less safe opinion. </ul> With the first of these propositions Probabilists agree &#151; but they deny the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the second and third propositions (cf. Marc, "Institutiones Morales", I, nn. 91-103).

<p>Arguments for &AElig;quiprobabilism: (1) In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their first proposition &AElig;quiprobabilists quote the axiom: <em>lex dubia non obligat</em>. When the opposing probabilities are equal or nearly equal, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> in the strict sense, and a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> law imposes no <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. They also apply the rule: in dubio melior est conditio possidentis. When the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> regards the existence, as distinguished from the cessation of a law, liberty is in possession and accordingly the opinion which favours liberty can be followed in practice.

<p>(2) In <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their second proposition, &AElig;quiprobabilists quote the same axiom: in dubio melior est conditio possidentis. When the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerns the cessation of a law, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is in possession, and therefore the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> must be observed until it is displaced by a stronger probability in favour of liberty.

<p>Probabilists reply to this argument that liberty is always in possession, since <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> and <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> presuppose liberty in the subject.

<p>(3) In proof of their third proposition &AElig;quiprobabilists put forward various arguments, of which the following are the most forcible:

<p>(a) A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> is bound seriously to endeavour to bring his actions into harmony with objective morality. But a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who follows the less probable opinion in favour of liberty fails to observe this dictate of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, and consequently acts unlawfully (cf. <a href="../cathen/15715a.htm">Wouters</a> "De Minusprobabilismo", p. 71).

<p>Probabilists reply that this argument, if carried to its <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> conclusion, would end in Rigorism, because the only way efficiently to bring our actions into perfect harmony with objective morality is to follow the safe opinion, so long as the less safe opinion has not acquired moral <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>. This is the only way of preventing all serious danger of committing material <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and consequently is the only way of observing perfect harmony with objective morality. Since, however, Rigorism is universally condemned, the argument must be rejected, and the principles of <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a> must be adopted which hold that it is sufficient to observe harmony with objective morality in so far as this is known with moral <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> (cf. Lehmkuhl, "Theologia Moralis", I, n. 191).

<p>(b) On 26 June, 1680 the Holy Office, under the presidency of <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>, issued, in connection with the teaching of Thyrsus Gonzalez, S.J., a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of which the authentic text was published 19 April 1902, by the Secretary of the Holy Office. So much controversy has recently arisen in regard to the value of <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, that it is opportune to quote the whole text: <blockquote> A report having been made by Father Laurea of the contents of a letter directed by Father Thyrsus Gonzalez, S.J., to Our Most Holy Lord; the Most Eminent Lords said that the Secretary of State must write to the Apostolic Nuncio of the Spains [directing him] to signify to the said Father Thyrsus that His Holiness, having received his letter favourably, and having read it with approval, has commanded that he [Thyrsus] shall freely and fearlessly preach, teach, and defend with his pen the more probable opinion, and also manfully attack the opinion of those who assert that in a conflict of a less probable opinion with a more probable, known and estimated as such, it is allowed to follow the less probable; and to inform him that whatever he does and writes on behalf of the more probable opinion will be pleasing to His Holiness.

<p>Let it be enjoined upon the Father General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a>, as by order [de ordine] of His Holiness, not only to permit the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> to write in favour of the more probable opinion and to attack the opinion of those who assert that in a conflict of a less probable opinion with a more probable, known and estimated as such, it is allowed to follow the less probable- but also to write to all the Universities of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society</a> [informing them] that it is the mind of His Holiness that whosoever chooses may freely write in favour of the more probable opinion, and may attack the aforesaid contrary [opinion]; and to order them to submit entirely to the command of His Holiness. </blockquote>

<p>&AElig;quiprobabilists say that in this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> there is a clear expression of the mind of <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> about the morality of teaching that it is permissible to act on the less safe opinion when the safe opinion is certainly more probable. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> disapproves of this teaching, commends Father Gonzalez for his opposition to It, and orders the General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> to allow full liberty so that anyone who pleases may write against it.

<p>Probabilists reply that, though <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a> was opposed to <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>, his official <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> merely commanded that liberty of teaching be allowed to the members of the order. Moreover, they point out that Gonzalez was not an &AElig;quiprobabilist, but a Probabiliorist of a strict type whom St. Alphonsus regarded as an extremist.
<h3 id="B">Probabiliorism</h3>

<p>According to the teaching of Probabiliorists, it is unlawful to act on the less safe opinion unless it is also the more probable opinion. In addition to an argument derived from the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/08021a.htm">Innocent XI</a>, the principal arguments for Probabiliorism are the following:

<p>(1) It is not lawful to follow the less safe opinion, unless it is truly and expeditely probable. But an opinion which is opposed by a more probable opinion is not truly and expeditely probable, since its arguments are annulled by more potent opposing arguments and cannot in consequence gain the assent of a prudent man. Hence it is not lawful for a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to follow the less safe opinion when he regards the safe opinion as more probable.

<p>As has already been explained in connection with <a href="../cathen/12441a.htm">Probabilism</a>, Probabilists maintain that the less safe opinion does not necessarily lose its solid probability because of more probable opposing arguments. This being so, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is not certain, and consequently does not impose an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> in regard to action, even though in regard to speculative assent it is rightly looked on as more probable.

<p>(2) As in speculative <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> we are bound to give assent to the new which is more likely to exclude <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, so in practical <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about lawfulness we are bound to adopt the opinion which is more likely to exclude the danger of material <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But the more probable opinion is the more likely to exclude this danger. (Consequently in practical <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> we are bound to adopt the Probabiliorist view. Probabilists reply that this argument leads to Tutiorism rather than to Probabiliorism, because the only efficacious way of excluding reasonable danger of material <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to act on the safe opinion so long as the less safe opinion is not morally certain. Moreover, Probabiliorism would impose an intolerable burden on the consciences of timorous minds, since it would demand an investigation into the various degrees of probability, 80 as to enable a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> definitely to say that one opinion is more probable than another. In view of the great diversity of opinion, which exists on many moral subjects, this definite judgment is practically impossible, especially in the case of the vast majority of men who are not experts in moral <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>.
<h3 id="C">Compensationism</h3>

<p>This maintains that a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> law is not devoid of all binding force, and that there must be a compensating reason, proportionate to the probability and gravity of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, to justify the performance of the action which is probably forbidden. This teaching is based on an analogy with an act which has two effects, one good and the other bad. It is not lawful to perform such an act unless there is a justifying cause proportionate to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. In the case of a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> law the bad effect is the danger of material <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the good effect is the benefit, which arises from the performance of the action which is probably forbidden. Hence in this as in the former case, a compensating cause, proportionate to the probable <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is required to justify the performance of the action.

<p>Probabilists reply that this moral system leads to Tutiorism, because it implies that if no compensating benefit exists, it is not lawful to perform an action so long as it certainly is not forbidden. Again, Probabilists say that the preservation of liberty is of itself a sufficient compensating reason when there is question of a law which is not certain. Finally, Probabilists are prepared to admit that, as a point of expediency though not of <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>, it is advisable to look for a compensating cause over and above the preservation of liberty when a confessor is directing penitents in the use of probable opinions. If no such compensating reason exists, the penitent can be advised, though not under pain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to abstain from the performance of the action which is probably forbidden.
