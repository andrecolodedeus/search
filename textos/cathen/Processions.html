<h1>Processions</h1>  

<p>Processions, an element in all ceremonial, are to be found, as we should expect, in almost every form of religious worship. The example of the processions with the Ark in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> (cf. especially <a href="../bible/2sa006.htm">2 Samuel 6</a> and <a href="../bible/1ki008.htm">1 Kings 8</a>) and the triumphant entry of our Saviour into <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> in the New were probably not without influence upon the ritual of later ages. Even before the age of Constantine, the funeral processions of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> seem to have been carried out with a certain amount of solemnity, and the use of the word by <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> (De Praescriptio, xliii) may possibly have reference to some formal progress or movement of the faithful churchwards, which led afterwards to the assembly itself or the service being called <em>processio</em> as well as <em>synaxis</em> and <em>collecta</em> (Probst, "Sakramentarien und Ord.", 205). About the time of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, and possibly earlier, two forms of procession played a great part in <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> ceremonial. The one was the procession to the "Station", the other the solemn entry of the celebrant from the <em>secretarium</em>, or <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a>, to the altar. A good description of the stational procession is given in the St. Amand Ordo, n. 6 (Duchesne, "Christian Worship", 474). The pontiff, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and the people assembled in the appointed church, where the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> vested and the office was begun. The poor people of the <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospital</a> went first with a <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> wooden cross; the seven stationary crosses, with three candles each and a retinue, followed, and then the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>; finally came the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> surrounded by his <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, with two crosses borne before him and the <em>schola cantorum</em> or choir following behind him. As the procession moved along to the stational church where the Mass was to be offered the <a href="../cathen/08714a.htm">Kyrie Eleison</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a> were sung, from which the procession itself was often called <em>litania</em>. The solemn entrance of the celebrant as he proceeded from the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> to the altar was of course a procession on a smaller scale, but this also is minutely described in the first "Ordo". The pontiff was again surrounded by his <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and preceded by the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacons</a>, one of whom swung a thurible, and a conspicuous feature was the group of seven <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> carrying tapers, which make us think of the seven candles now lighted on the altar at a pontifical High Mass. In this procession to the altar the antiphon of the introit was sung. On certain special occasions, notably St. Mark's Day (25 April), which coincided with the old Roman festival of the <em>Robigalia</em>, and in Gaul on the three Rogation Days before the <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">feast of the Ascension</a>, there were processions of exceptional solemnity (see Litany).

<p>Although not now formally recognized as a procession in the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">liturgical books</a>, we may say that the sprinkling of the congregation with <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a> at the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> Mass on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> preserves for us the memory of the most familiar procession of the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. The rite is prescribed in the Capitularies of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and of Louis the Pious, as well as in other ninth-century documents. For example a Council of <a href="../cathen/10681a.htm">Nantes</a> before the year 900 enjoins that "every <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> before Mass, each <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is to <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">bless</a> water in a vessel which is clean and suitable for so great a mystery, for the people to be sprinkled with when they enter the church, and let him make the round of the yard [<em>atrium</em>] of the said church with the [processional] crosses, sprinkling it with the <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a>, and let him <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of them that rest therein" (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, "Concilia", XVIII, 173). In the monastic ceremonials of the same period this <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a> procession on the Sunday morning was usually described in much detail. After the sprinkling of the <a href="../cathen/07346b.htm">high altar</a> and of the other altars of the church in order, the whole body of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, after being sprinkled themselves, went in procession through the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloister</a>, making stations there, while the celebrant assisted by two <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> blessed the different portions of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> (see Mart&egrave;ne, "De antiq. eccles. rit.", IV, 46-9). At the present day the Roman <a href="../cathen/10354c.htm">Missal</a>, which is the primary <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> authority for this "Blessing of the people with <a href="../cathen/07432a.htm">holy water</a> to be imparted on <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>" (Benedictio populi cum aqua benedicta diebus dominicis impertienda), says nothing about a procession, though some such progress of the celebrant and assistant clerks around the church very commonly takes place. The <a href="../cathen/13216a.htm">rubric</a> only directs that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> having intoned the antiphon "Asperges me" is to sprinkle the altar and then himself and his assistants. After which he is to sprinkle the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the people, while he recites the Miserere with his assistants in a low voice. The other ordinary processions, as opposed to the extraordinary processions, which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> may enjoin or permit as circumstances may call for such a form of public supplication, are specified in the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a> to be the Procession of Candles on the Purification of our Lady (2 February), that of Palms on <a href="../cathen/11432b.htm">Palm Sunday</a>, the greater <a href="../cathen/09286a.htm">litanies</a> on the feast of St. Mark (25 April), the Rogation processions on the three days before the <a href="../cathen/01767b.htm">Ascension</a>, and the procession of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> on the feast of <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>. The prescriptions to be observed on all these occasions are duly set down in the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a>. For their history etc., see <a href="../cathen/03245b.htm">Candlemas</a>; <a href="../cathen/04390b.htm">Corpus Christi</a>; <a href="../cathen/07435a.htm">Holy Week</a>; Litany, etc. We might also add to these "ordinary" processions the carrying of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> to the altar of repose on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a> and the return on <a href="../cathen/06643a.htm">Good Friday</a>, as well as the visit to the font on <a href="../cathen/07424a.htm">Holy Saturday</a> and the procession which forms part of the rite of the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07421b.htm">holy oils</a> in <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral churches</a> on <a href="../cathen/10068a.htm">Maundy Thursday</a>. This latter function is described in full in the Roman Pontifical. In earlier times a series of processions were usually made to the font after <a href="../cathen/15381a.htm">Vespers</a> upon every day of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> week (Morin in "Rev. benedict.", VI, 150). Traces of this rite lingered on in many local churches down to the eighteenth and ninteenth centuries, but it finds no official recognition in the Roman service books.

<p>Under the heading of "extraordinary" processions the <a href="../cathen/13088b.htm">Roman Ritual</a> makes provision for the following emergencies: a procession to ask for rain, another to beg for fine weather, a third to drive away storms, three others assigned respectively to seasons of famine, plague, and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, one more general on occasion of any calamity (<em>pro quacunque tribulatione</em>), one rather lengthy form (in which a number of the Jubilate and Laudate psalms are indicated for recitation) by way of solemn thanksgiving, and finally a form for the translation of important <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> (<em>reliquiarum insignium</em>). In the majority of these extraordinary processions it is directed that the <a href="../cathen/09291a.htm">Litany of the Saints</a> be chanted as in the Rogation processions, a supplication special to the occasion being usually added and repeated, for example in the procession "to ask for rain" the petition is inserted: "Ut congruentem pluviam fidelibus tuis concedere digneris. Te rogamus audi nos [That thou wouldst vouchsafe to grant suitable rain unto thy faithful, we beseech thee hear us]". In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> rituals and processionals a large variety of such exceptional forms may be found, connected especially with supplications for the produce of the earth. A common feature in many of these was to make a station towards the four points of the compass and to read at each the beginning of one of the four Gospels with other <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. The practice of carrying the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> upon such occasions is frequently condemned in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> the perambulation of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> on the "Gang days", as the Rogation days were called, lasted far into the seventeenth century. Aubrey, for example, in a pencil note to his "Remaines": "On Rogation Days the Gospells were read in the cornfields here in England untill the Civill wars" (Hazlitt, "Faiths and Folklore", II, 478). The custom of making these processions was kept up seemingly with a view to its utility in impressing upon the memory the boundaries of the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, and in some places boys were flogged at the boundaries that they might remember the spot in old age. In the Greek and some other Oriental <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> the two processions known as the great and little entrances form a very imposing feature of the rite. At the "little entrance" the Book of the Gospels is carried in by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> accompanied by <a href="../cathen/01106a.htm">acolytes</a> bearing torches and two fans. The "great entrance" takes place when the holy gifts, i.e. the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>, are solemnly brought to the altar while the choir sing the famous "cherubic <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymn</a>". Similar features seem to have existed in the early Gallican Liturgy; even in the Roman high Mass the procession which heralds the singing of the Gospel is probably the survival of a more imposing <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a> of earlier date.
