<h1>Promulgation</h1>  

<p>(<a href="../cathen/09019a.htm">Latin</a> <em>promulgare,</em> to make known, to post in public).
<h2 id="section1">Promulgation in general</h2>

<p>This is the act by which the legislative power makes legislative enactments known to the authorities entrusted with their execution and to the subjects bound to observe them. Philosophically it is a matter of dispute whether promulgation is of the essence of a law. It seems indisputable that the essential element of a law is the will of the legislator, but it is clear that the legislator should make known his will and intention in one way or another. This manifestation is the promulgation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, which is not necessarily distinct from the very elaboration of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, provided that this takes place by external acts&mdash;such as the vote of a legislative assembly or by royal sanction. Such is the practice observed in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and in most of the states of the American Union, but, as it was thought too severe, the legislation of various countries requires the promulgation of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> by a special formal act, through which the text of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> is made known to the community, e.g. by publication of this text in an official journal or bulletin of the Government. Previous to this publication the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> does not take effect. The promulgation of a law must not be confounded with its publication, the object of the first being to make known the will of the legislator, of the second to spread the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of legislative enactments among sujects bound to observe them.
<h2 id="section2">Promulgation in canon law</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has long exacted the promulgation of a law by a special act of the authorities: "Leges instituuntur quum promulgantur", a law is not really a law until it has been made known, says Gratian (Decretum Gratiani, pt. I, c. 3, dist. VII). However, no special form is prescribed for acts of <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> inferior to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, even synodal decrees being considered sufficiently promulgated by being read in the synod. The Constitution "Promulgandi" of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> (29 September, 1908) determined the ordinary method of promulgating pontifical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> namely by the insertion of the text of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> in the "Acta Apostolica Sedis" (the official publication of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>), after the insertion has been ordered by the secretary or the supreme authority of the congregation or the office through the medium of which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> has passed the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. A regulation of 5 January, 1910, divides the official bulletin of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> into two parts: in the first or official part should be inserted all documents requiring promulgation to have the force of law; the second merely serves to illustrate and supplement the first (Acta Apost. Sedis, 1910, p. 36). However, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> explicitly reserves the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to determine in exceptional cases another method of promulgation. Prior to this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> two systems had been chiefly in use in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>&mdash;provincial promulgation, until the end of the thirteenth century, and Roman promulgation. During the first period promulgation often took place in the different ecclesiastical provinces either through special envoys or through the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Nevertheless it is also a fact that <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> binding in one province were also binding in others. During the second period the custom, which became exclusive during the fifteenth century, developed of having the new <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> read and posted up by <em>cursores</em> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> only, at the doors of the great <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a>, the Palazzo Cancellaria, the Campo de&rsquo; fiori, and sometimes at the Capitol. The value of this means of promulgation was disputed in modern times: some claimed that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had admitted the arrangements of Novels lxvi and cxvi of Justinian, which required provincial promulgation for some <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; others maintained that in theory publication at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was sufficient, but that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> did not wish to bind the faithful before the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were made known to them by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; while others appealed to ancient customs, to which the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> should conform. This last theory, made use of by the Gallicans and <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">Febronianists</a>, furnished the State with a pretext for preventing the promulgation of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which it did not like. A special method of promulgation was also introduced wtih the express or tacit consent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> for the decrees of congregations; they were published at the secretariate of the dicasteries from which they emanated.
