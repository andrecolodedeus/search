<h1>Proprium</h1>  

<p>The <em>Proprium de tempore</em> and the <em>Proprium Sanctorum</em> form in the present liturgy the two principal portions of our <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> and Missals; the first comprises the parts appointed for the days of the year having special Masses or Offices (introits, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, lessons, responses, versicles, <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, etc.); the second is devoted to the Offices of the Saints.

<p>The <em>Proprium de tempore</em> begins with the first <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sunday</a> of <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> and ends with the last Sunday after Pentecost. It includes, after <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a>, the parts assigned for the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> season (six <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>); <a href="../cathen/13721b.htm">Septuagesima</a>, three weeks; <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lent</a>, six weeks; <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Paschal time</a>, fifty days; Pentecost, and the twenty-four <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> after. Most of the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> comprising this cycle, and often weekdays, have special Offices which composed the <em>Proprium de tempore</em>.

<p>The <em>Proprium Sanctorum</em> comprises all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> days with special Offices, from St. Andrew on 30 November. The Offices of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, like those de tempore, are composed of lessons, <a href="../cathen/01575b.htm">antiphons</a>, responses, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, or other <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> passages special to these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> feasts. It is unnecessary to remark that this arrangement is not primitive. Ages passed before the present <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> cycle was evolved. In the <a href="../cathen/09296a.htm">Liturgical Books</a> before the ninth or eighth century, the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a> after Pentecost form groups, called after some solemn festival, <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">St. John the Baptist</a>, the Apostles, or <a href="../cathen/10275b.htm">St. Michael</a>; the season of <a href="../cathen/13721b.htm">Septuagesima</a> did not yet exist, at least in its entirety. A century or two later the <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a> season had not been evolved, even the weeks of <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> had practically no special Offices. In the first ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, except for the feast of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Sundays</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> cycle did not exist. The <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a> and the Liturgy of the Mass were performed with the help of the books of the old and the New Testaments, and consisted in the chanting of psalms or canticles, readings, exhortations, and impromptu <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> cycle, that is, the feasts of the year or of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> exerted hardly any influence on the Liturgy, and in this sense it may be said that in the beginning there was neither a <em>Proprium de tempore</em> nor a <em>Proprium Sanctorum</em>. Probst (op. cit. infra) thinks that it was at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in the fourth century under Pope Damasus, that this <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> "reform" took place, especially in arranging the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to suit the season and the feasts of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. This may be accepted with some reservations, as it is indisputable that even then the cycle had exerted its influence on the liturgy, in certain special circumstances. It seems certain that the origin of the Common of the Saints is the same as that of the <em>Propria</em>, and that it was at first a <em>Proprium</em>; for instance, the Common of the Apostles was originally the <em>Proprium</em> of the Apostles St. Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>; and the Common of a Martyr was originally the <em>Proprium</em> of St. Stephen and <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>.
