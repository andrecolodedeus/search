<h1>Protopope</h1>  

<p>A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of higher rank in the Orthodox and Byzantine <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Churches, corresponding in general to the Western <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> or dean. The <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of these dignitaries have varied to some extent at different times and in different local Churches. Roughly the titles <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> (<em>archipresbyteros</em>), <em>protopriest</em> (<em>protoiereus, protopresbyteros</em>), <em>protopope</em> (<em>protopapas</em>) may be taken as meaning; the same thing, though they have occasionally been distinguished. The general <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is that the <a href="../cathen/01697b.htm">archpriest</a> has the highest rank in his order; he comes immediately after the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In the fifth century he appears as head of the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> delegate for certain <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of visitation and judgment, as his representative in case of absence or death (<em>sede vacante</em>). So Liberatus: "Breviarium", XIV (P.L., LXVIII, 1016). He therefore combined the offices of our modern dean of the chapter, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> and <a href="../cathen/15401c.htm">vicar capitular</a>. The title recurs constantly in the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> (Bingham, op. cit., I, 292 sqq.). At Constantinople there was an elaborately organized court of <a href="../cathen/11727a.htm">ecclesiastical persons</a> around the patriarch, whose various places in choir when the patriarch celebrated are given in the Euchologion together with a statement of their <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. Among these the protopope had the first place on the left. "The protopope stands above the left choir when the pontiff celebrates, he gives to him [the pontiff] <a href="../cathen/07402a.htm">Holy Communion</a> and in the same way the pontiff to the protopope and he has all first places [<em>ta proteia panta</em>] in the church" (Goar, 225). Under him is the "second one" (<em>ho deutereuon</em>), who takes his place in his absence (ibid.). So also <a href="../cathen/01317b.htm">Leo Allatius's</a> list, where it is said further that: "he holds the place [<em>kraton topon</em>, as deputy] of the pontiff" (ibid., 229). He is promoted by presentation to the patriarch, who lays his hand on him with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> cry <em>"axios"</em> three times (the rite from <a href="../cathen/01317b.htm">Allatius</a> is given by Goar, 238). Goar notes that the protopope, at least to some extent, succeeded to the place of the <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopus</a>. He could ordain <a href="../cathen/09111a.htm">lectors</a>; at concelebrations where no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is present he presided and said the <em>Ekphoneseis.</em> In the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> absence he took his place as president, and had <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> over his fellow-clergy. George Kodinos (fourteenth century) says of the protopope: "he is first in the tribunal [<em>tou bematos</em>, in authority] holding the second place after the pontiff" (De Officiis, I, quoted by Goar 237).

<p>Distinct from the official of the patriarchal court, though bearing the same title, were the protopopes in the country <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. They correspond to our rural deans, having delegate episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> for minor cases, from which appeal may be made to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. So <a href="../cathen/02226b.htm">Theodore Balsamon</a> (twelfth century): "It is forbidden by the canons that there should be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in small towns and villages and because of this they ordain for these, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who are protopopes and <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopi</a>" (Syntagma, III, 142). There are cases in which a protopope in a remote place has episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, but not orders, like some <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a>, or the archpriests in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> from 1599 to 1621. In such cases they are distinguished from archpriests and have such officials under them (so the introduction to Nicholas Bulgaris's "Sacred Catechism", Venice, 1681).

<p>In modern times the Orthodox (and Eastern <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>) title of protopope often means hardly more than a complimentary title conveying a certain rank and precedence with sometimes a few unimportant <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. Often in a church that has several <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> (as we should say a <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> and <a href="../cathen/04570a.htm">curates</a>) the first (<a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>) is called protopope. In <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="../cathen/13224b.htm">Rumania</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a> the protopopes have authority over a district containing several <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. They have to visit these occasionally and represent for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> the court of first instance. In Orthodox <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> and <a href="../cathen/15022a.htm">Transylvania</a> there are protopresbyterates (eparchies), in which the protopope is elected by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people and rules under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. In these cases he may be compared to our rural deans. Such an office is the highest to which a married Orthodox <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> may aspire, since <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are always <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. In <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> the protopope (protoierei) sometimes wears the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/10404a.htm">mitre</a> and <em>epigonation</em>, but not the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm#omophorion"><em>omophorion</em></a> or <em>sakkos.</em>
