<h1>Provincial Council</h1>  

<p>A deliberative assembly of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of an <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a>, summoned and presided over by the metropolitan, to discuss <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> affairs and enact <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">disciplinary</a> regulations for the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">province</a>.

<p>The good government of a <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> as vast as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> required grouping of those <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> whose similar interests would gain by common treatment. This led to the organization of ecclesiastical provinces and so of provincial councils. As long as administrative centralization in the great sees was imperfect, and while the general canon law was being slowly evolved, this provincial grouping was very important. The Councils of Nic&aelig;a (325, can. v), Antioch (341, can. xx), and others ordered the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of each province to meet twice a year; however, even in the East, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> was not long observed; the Councils "in Trullo" (692, can. viii) and Nic&aelig;a (787, can. vi) prescribe, but with little success, only one meeting each year. In the West, except in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, and in a certain sense also at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, provincial councils were neither frequent nor regular; most of those that were held, and which have left us precious documents, were episcopal assemblies of several provinces or regions. In spite of the frequent renewal of the ancient legislation provincial councils did not become a regular institution. The great Lateran Council (1215) also ordered an annual provincial council, but it was not long obeyed. The Councils of Basle (1433) and <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> also tried to revive the provincial councils, and ordered them to be held at least every three years (sees. XXIV, c. ii), laying down for them a certain programme. As a result there was, towards the end of the sixteenth century, in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries, a remarkable series of provincial councils, notably those of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, under <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a>; but the movement soon waned. Towards the middle of the nineteenth century there was a fresh series of provincial councils in almost all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries, but they were never assembled with the punctuality prescribed by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> authorized Latin America to hold them every twelve years (1897; cf. "Cone. plen.", 1899, n. 283). It must be admitted, however, that modern facilities of communication, and still more the custom of unconventional episcopal reunions or conferences, have compensated for the rarity of provincial councils to a large extent.

<p>(1) The <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> has the right and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of convoking the council; the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (cit. c. ii) ordered it to be convoked, first in the year following its own close, and then every third year at least; if the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> is prevented or the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> is vacant, the senior suffragan acts. The time appointed is after the octave of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, "or at another more opportune time, according to the usage of the province". It is not <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to hold the council in the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> city; any town in the province may be selected. The penalty of suspension with which the Councils of the Lateran (c. xxv, "De accusat.") and <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a> threatened negligent <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitans</a> has certainly fallen into desuetude.

<p>(2) All those who, "by right or by custom", have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to assist at the council are to be convoked. These are, first, the suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; exempt <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/05706a.htm">immediately subject</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, must choose, once for all, the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> whose council they will attend, without prejudice to their exemptions and privileges. Secondly, those who exercise an external <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>: <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> nullius, vicars capitular or administrators Apostolic of vacant sees, and <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">vicars Apostolic</a> if any. These have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to take part in the deliberations. The council may allow this also to <a href="../cathen/08025a.htm">titular</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and the representatives of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> prevented from attending. The other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> convoked, with a right only to take part in consultations, are non-exempt <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, deputies of <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> or even collegiate chapters, superiors of religious institutes, deputies of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a> and rectors of <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, and lastly the consultors, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, and canonists. The <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> called to the council are strictly <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to attend, unless legitimately prevented, in which case they must excuse themselves under penalty of censure. Formerly, negligent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were deprived of communion with their colleagues (cf. can. x, xiii, xiv, Dist. xviii); but this penalty is obsolete. It is not permissible to leave the council before its close without a just and approved reason.

<p>(3) The ceremonies of the provincial council are regulated by the Pontifical (3rd part, "Ordo ad synodum"), and the Ceremonial of the Bishops (lib. I, c. xxxi); they include in particular the profession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The work of the council is prepared in special commissions or congregations; the decrees are enacted in private or public sessions, and are decided by a majority of the members having a deliberative vote. The <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> presides, directs the discussions, proposes the subjects, but he has not a preponderating voice and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> can take up whatever matters or proposals they judge fitting. The adjournment or close, generally at a solemn public session, is announced by the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> with the consent of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>.

<p>(4) The provincial council is not competent to deal directly with matters of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by defining or condemning; yet it may treat of such from a disciplinary point of view: promoting religious teaching, pointing out the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the day, defending the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Its proper sphere is <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a>; to correct abuses, to watch over the observance of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> especially the reform <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>; to promote the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people, to settle disputes, to decide minor differences between <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to adopt measures and make suitable regulations for all these objects. The decrees of the provincial councils are binding on the whole province; each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, however, may prudently grant <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensations</a> in his own diocese, as he is the legislator; but he may not abrogate the decrees of the Council. If the Council deems any derogation from the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> useful, it ought to send a postulatum to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>.

<p>(5) Within the limits indicated above, a provincial council is a legislative body whose acts do not require <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> confirmation for their validity. It is customary indeed to ask for the pontifical <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a>; but the latter is generally given in common form only, so that the decrees continue to be provincial decrees, and can be abrogated by a later council; if, however, the approval is given in specific form, as the Council of Mount Lebanon was approved by <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a>, the decrees acquire a supplementary authority and may not be modified without the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> consent.

<p>In any case, the decrees of every provincial council must be revised; <a href="../cathen/14033a.htm">Sixtus V</a> (1587) so ordered, and the revision was entrusted to the Sacred Congregation of the Council; but in virtue of the Constitution "Sapienti" of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> (29 June, 1908) the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> now devolves on the Sacred Congregation of the Consistory.
