<h1>Pr&uuml;m</h1>  

<p>A former <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>, now in the <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Diocese of Trier</a>, founded by a <a href="../cathen/06238a.htm">Frankish</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> Bertrada, and her son Charibert, 23 June, 720. The first head of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was Angloardus. Bertrada's grand-daughter was <a href="../cathen/02519a.htm">Bertha</a>, wife of King Pepin (751-68), and Pr&uuml;m became the favourite <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the Carlovingians and received large endowments and privileges. Pepin rebuilt the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and bestowed great estates upon it, 13 August, 762. The king brought <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from Meaux under Abbot Assuerus to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. The church, dedicated to the Saviour (Salvator), was not completed until the reign of <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, 26 July, 799, by <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Pope Leo III</a>. <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a> and succeeding emperors were liberal patrons of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. Several of the Carlovingians entered the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> at Pr&uuml;m; among these was Lothair I, who became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> in 855. His grave was rediscovered in 1860; in 1874 the Emperor William I erected a monument over it. In 882 and 892 the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was plundered and devastated by the Normans, but it soon recovered. The landed possessions were so large that the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> developed into a principality.

<p>At times during the eleventh and twelfth centuries the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> contained over three hundred <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The period of its internal prosperity extends to the thirteenth century. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were energetic cultivators of the land. About 836 Abbot Marquard founded a new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, M&uuml;nstereifel; in 1017 Abbot Urald founded at Pr&uuml;m a collegiate foundation for twelve priests; in 1190 Abbot Gerhard founded a house for ladies of noble birth at Niederpr&uuml;m. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> cared for the poor and sick. Learning was also cultivated. Among those who taught in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> were Ado, later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Vienne (860-75). Another head of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, Wandelbert (813-70), was a distinguished poet. Abbot Regino (893-99) made a name for himself as historian and codifier of canon law. <a href="../cathen/03137a.htm">C&aelig;sarius of Heisterbach</a> is only brought into the list of authors of this <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> by being confounded with Abbot C&aelig;sarius of Pr&uuml;m (1212-16). In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> declined, partly from the oppression of its secular administrators, but more from internal decay. It reached such a pass that the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> divided the revenues among themselves and lived apart from one another. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> sought to incorporate the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> in the archdiocese. In 1376 Charles IV gave his consent to this, as did <a href="../cathen/02670a.htm">Boniface IX</a> in 1379, but the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope's</a> consent was recalled in 1398; <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> about 1473 also gave his approval to the incorporation. But the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a> refused to submit and even in 1511 carried on <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>. Finally, when the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was near ruin, <a href="../cathen/07001b.htm">Gregory XIII</a> issued the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of incorporation 24 Aug., 1574, which was carried into effect in 1576 after the death of Abbot Christopher von Manderscheid. After this the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> were "perpetual administrators" of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> was now brought into order within and without, and once more flourished to such a degree that the two arch&aelig;ologists Mart&egrave;ne and Durand, who visited the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in 1718, state in their "Voyage litt&eacute;raire" that of all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> Pr&uuml;m showed the best spirit, and study was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> pursued. The <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> made efforts even in the eighteenth century to shake off the supremacy of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>.

<p>In 1801 Pr&uuml;m fell to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, was secularized, and its estates sold. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> gave its buildings to the city. Since 1815 Pr&uuml;m has belonged to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>. The church, built in 1721 by the Elector Louis, is now a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church. The monastic buildings are now used for the district court and the high-school. The sandals of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are considered to be the most notable of the many <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of the church; they are mentioned by Pepin in the deed of 762. He is said to have received them from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as a gift of <a href="../cathen/15743b.htm">Pope Zacharias</a> or Pope Stephen.
