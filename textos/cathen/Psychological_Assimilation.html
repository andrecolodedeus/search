<h1>Psychological Assimilation</h1>  

<p>As applied to a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> process, assimilation derives all its force and meaning from the analogy which many educationists have found to exist between the <a href="../cathen/01800c.htm">way in which food is incorporated into the living tissue</a> and the manner in which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is acquired by the growing mind. That <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> means the assimilation of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is almost a commonplace in modern pedagogy. Few, however, have felt the full force of the comparison or realized how completely the <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> in this as in other instances follows on the lines of the physiological. Just as the living cell cannot delegate the task of assimilation, so the mind cannot by any contrivance of <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> methods evade the task of performing the assimilative process for itself. All that the teacher can do is to prepare the material and to stimulate the mind of the pupil; the pupil himself must perform the final act of acquiring <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, namely the act of incorporating into his mind the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> presented to him. In the second place, the mind cannot take over into its own substance a complex <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as such. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must first be broken up into less complex component parts, which are assimilable by the mind in its present condition of development.

<p>There is little profit, for example, in placing before the pupil a finished essay, unless the pupil is taught to analyze the finished literary product into its constituent elements, and to reconstruct those elements into a living whole. This, of course, implies much more than the task of summarizing each paragraph and labelling it more or less happily. When the term assimilation is used with reference to <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> development, it is well to remember that, while it originally referred to the building up of anatomical elements, these elements, once constructed, have an immediate <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> bearing. Each particle of matter that is lifted into the living tissue acquires thereby a functional unity, that is, it is brought into functional relation with every other particle of the organism. Similarly, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> once incorporated into the mind sheds its light on the entire <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> content, and is in turn illuminated by every previously assimilated <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Acting on these principles, the up-to-date educationist insists: first, that each new <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> should be not only an addition to the stock of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the pupil, but also a functional acquisition, something that stimulates the pupil's mind to increased activity; secondly, that in every <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> endeavor the centre of orientation should be shifted from the <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> centre of the body of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to be imparted to the present needs and capacities of the growing mind.
