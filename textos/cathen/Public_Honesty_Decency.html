<h1>Public Honesty (Decency)</h1>  

<p>A diriment matrimonial impediment consisting in a relationship, which arises from a valid <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a>, or from a marriage approved by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> but not consummated. Marriage between the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> affected by this impediment, as described below, is null; were it possible for them to marry they might be exposed to incontinency, owing particularly to their intimacy and familiar intercourse.

<p>Traces of this impediment are found under another name in <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, since according to Modestinus (D. XXIII, ii, 42, De ritu nuptiarum) not only what is lawful, but likewise what is eminently fitting, is to be observed in entering into wedlock. Hence in <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a> affinity arising from a valid marriage, whether consummated or not, constituted a diriment impediment between the affined in all degrees throughout the direct line, and to the second degree (civil method of computing) in the indirect or oblique line. Moreover, there was a quasi-affinity, which, for the safeguarding of public <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, rendered matrimony null and void: (1) between a man and his stepdaughter or between a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and her stepson; (2) between a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and the son or father of her <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, and conversely between a man and the daughter or mother of his <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">affianced</a> (D. XXIII, ii, 12 and 14); (3) lastly, between <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> affined through <a href="../cathen/04207a.htm">concubinage</a> (bc. cit., 14 and D. XXXVIII, x, 7).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, imitating this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a>, admits an impediment, which, in her estimation, is required by public decency or good <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>. In canon law carnal intercourse, licit or otherwise, is the principle of affinity; in <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>, it is valid marriage, whether consummated or not. Public honesty then coincides at times with the affinity of the Romans, at times with their quasi-affinity. The institution of this impediment is sometimes attributed, but wrongly, to <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a>. It doubtless owes its existence not to a positive law, but to custom and probably dates back to the twelfth century (<a href="../cathen/02485c.htm">Berardi</a>, III, diss. II, cap. iii). Canons xi, xiv, xv (Caus. II, Q. ii) in Gratian's Decretum, indicating an earlier existence of this impediment, are <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> (Gasparri, "De Matrimonio", n. 801).

<p>According to our present legislation (Trent, Sess. XXIV, cap. iii, De Ref. Matr.) the impediment of public honesty arises from a valid <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a> between the male party to the contract and the blood relatives of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in the first degree (mother, daughter, sister), and conversely between the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and the blood relatives of the man in the same degree (father, son, brother). Once existing, the impediment always remains, even though the <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a> is lawfully broken (see <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">BETROTHAL</a>). It is to be noted that <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a>, to be valid, must now ("Ne temere" of <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>) be in writing, signed by the contracting parties and by the ordinary, or a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> within his own territory, or two witnesses. If one or the other of the contracting parties is unable to write, an additional witness is required. If the <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a> is conditional, the impediment does not arise till the condition is verified.

<p>Second, this impediment, for a stronger reason, is begotten by a marriage contract, not perfected by carnal relations &#151; and this, too, though the marriage be invalid, unless the invalidity be due to lack of lawful consent. By carnal intercourse public decency gives way to affinity, and, though some deny this, all admit that in a petition for a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> it is sufficient to express the impediment of <a href="../cathen/01178a.htm">affinity</a>, while public decency, if it still exist, is understood.

<p>A <a href="../cathen/09691b.htm">civil marriage</a> does not give rise to this impediment (S.C.C., 17 March, 1879), nor does public decency beget a second impediment prejudicial to a former <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a>; namely, a <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a> or marriage (unless consummated) with the mother, sister, or daughter of an <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">affianced</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> does not prohibit the keeping of one's troth to the said <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Since the impediment of public decency is of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> origin it follows that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may dispense from it, and that it does not affect unbaptized <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, even though later they become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. A <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from "Disparity of Worship" includes one in public decency, where the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> party requires such. Finally it is apparent that this impediment may be multiplied in the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, as, for instance, if one were to enter into <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothal</a> with several <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> related by blood in the first degree.
