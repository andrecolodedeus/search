<h1>Publius Helvius Pertinax</h1>  

<p>Roman Emperor (31 Dec., 192), b. at <a href="../cathen/01252a.htm">Alba Pompeia </a>, in Luguria, 1 August, 126; d. at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 28 March, 193. A freedman's son, he taught grammar at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> before entering the army. Because of his military ability and his competence in civil positions, he was made pr&aelig;tor and consul. His services in the campaign against Avidius Cassius led <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a> to give Pertinax the chief command of the army along the Danube, a position he filled with such distinction that <a href="../cathen/02109a.htm">Marcus Aurelius</a> made him successively governor of M&oelig;sia, Dacia, and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Commodus</a> first made him commander-in-chief of the troops in Britain, then appointed him governor in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, and finally made him prefect of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. On account of a conspiracy against <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Commodus</a> many innocent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, including Pertinax, were banished. After the strangling of <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Commodus</a>, Pertinax was proclaimed emperor by the soldiers at the suggestion of L&aelig;tus, prefect of the pr&aelig;torian guard. Pertinax had himself elected as head of the State once more by the senators and revived the title "Princeps Senatus"; on the first day of his reign he assumed the title "Pater Patri&aelig;". Pertinax strove to restore order in the administration of the State. By selling at auction the costly furniture and plate of <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Commodus</a> and by a frugal administration, before three months he was able to make gifts of money to the people and give to the pr&aelig;torian guard the promised largess. He also was able to resume public works. He separated public lands from those belonging to the emperor, endeavoured to bring about the resettling of deserted estates, to recall those arbitrarily banished, and to bring informers to trial. He refused the title of <a href="../cathen/02078b.htm">Augusta</a> for his wife, or that of C&aelig;sar for his son until he had earned the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. When the pr&aelig;torians saw that the emperor meant to restore the ancient discipline and when the prefect L&aelig;tus noticed that he strove to limit his own influence, he aroused the soldiers of the guard against the emperor. After suppressing the revolt of the consul, Sossius Falco, Pertinax declined to put him to death, though the Senate had decreed his execution. Several pr&aelig;torians were suspected of being members of the conspiracy; L&aelig;tus had these <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> without any trial and made the soldiers believe that it was done by imperial command. The pr&aelig;torians now resolved to depose Pertinax. One evening a mob of about two hundred soldiers went to the palace to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> the emperor. The latter came out to them without arms in the hope of quieting them by his personal influence. His words impressed the mutineers and they put their swords back in the scabbards, when suddenly a Tongrian cavalryman fell upon Pertinax and stabbed him in the breast. This incited the others who fell upon Pertinax; the emperor's head was put on a lance and carried through the streets of the city to the camp. Severus, the second successor of Pertinax, <a href="../cathen/01650b.htm">deified</a> him.
