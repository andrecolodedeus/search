<h2 id="i">Catholic doctrine</h2>

<p>Purgatory (Lat., "purgare", to make clean, to purify) in accordance with <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> is a <a href="../cathen/14167a.htm">place</a> or <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of temporal punishment for those who, departing this life in <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">God's grace</a>, are, not entirely free from venial faults, or have not fully paid the satisfaction due to their transgressions.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> concerning purgatory is clearly expressed in the Decree of Union drawn up by the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> (<a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, t. XXXI, col. 1031), and in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> which (Sess. XXV) <a href="../cathen/04675b.htm">defined</a>:

<blockquote><p>"Whereas the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, instructed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, has from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a> and the ancient tradition of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> taught in Councils and very recently in this Ecumenical synod (Sess. VI, cap. XXX; Sess. XXII cap.ii, iii) that there is a purgatory, and that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> therein are helped by the <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">suffrages</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, but principally by the acceptable <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Sacrifice of the Altar</a>; the <a href="../cathen/07428a.htm">Holy Synod</a> enjoins on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishops</a> that they diligently endeavor to have the sound <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Fathers in Councils regarding purgatory everywhere taught and preached, held and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>" (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, "Enchiridon", 983).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Further than this the definitions of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> do not go, but the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Schoolmen</a> must be consulted to explain the teachings of the councils, and to make clear the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and the practices of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.
<h3>Temporal punishment</h3>

<p>That temporal punishment is due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even after the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> itself has been <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">pardoned</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is clearly the teaching of <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a>. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> indeed brought <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> out of his first disobedience and gave him power to govern all things (<a href="../bible/wis010.htm#vrs2">Wisdom 10:2</a>), but still condemned him "to eat his bread in the sweat of his brow" until he returned unto dust. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forgave the incredulity of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, but in punishment kept them from the "land of promise" (<a href="../bible/num020.htm#vrs12">Numbers 20:12</a>). The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a> took away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> of the child was forfeited because <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> had made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> enemies <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> His <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Holy Name</a> (<a href="../bible/2sa012.htm#vrs13">2 Samuel 12:13-14</a>). In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> as well as in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a>, <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and in general penitential acts are the real fruits of repentance (<a href="../bible/mat003.htm#vrs8">Matthew 3:8</a>; <a href="../bible/luk017.htm#vrs3">Luke 17:3</a>; <a href="../bible/luk003.htm#vrs3">3:3</a>). The whole <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penitential</a> system of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> testifies that the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> assumption of penitential works has always been part of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> repentance and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XIV, can. xi) reminds the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does not always remit the whole punishment due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> together with the guilt. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> requires satisfaction, and will punish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> involves as its <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> consequence a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinner</a> failing to do penance in this <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a> may be punished in another world, and so not be cast off <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.
<h3>Venial sins</h3>

<p>All <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not equal before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor dare anyone assert that the daily faults of human frailty will be punished with the same severity that is meted out to serious violation of <a href="../cathen/09071a.htm">God's law</a>. On the other hand whosoever comes into <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> presence must be perfectly pure for in the strictest sense His "eyes are too pure, to behold <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>" (<a href="../bible/hab001.htm#vrs13">Habakkuk 1:13</a>). For unrepented venial faults for the payment of temporal punishment due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> at <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of death, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has always taught the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of purgatory.

<p>So deep was this <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> ingrained in our common <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">humanity</a> that it was accepted by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and in at least a shadowy way by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, long before the coming of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. ("Aeneid," VI, 735 sq.; Sophocles, "Antigone," 450 sq.).

<h2 id="ii">Errors</h2>

<p>Epiphanius (Haer., lxxv, P.G., XLII, col. 513) complains that <a href="../cathen/01174b.htm">A&euml;rius</a> (fourth century) taught that <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers for the dead</a> were of no avail. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of purgatory was rejected by the <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>, <a href="../cathen/15527b.htm">Waldenses</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a>. <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> (Serm. lxvi in Cantic., P.L. CLXXXIII, col. 1098) states that the so-called <a href="../cathen/01647a.htm">"Apostolici"</a> denied purgatory and the utility of <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers for the departed</a>. Much discussion has arisen over the position of the Greeks on the question of purgatory. It would seem that the great difference of opinion was not concerning the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of purgatory but concerning the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of purgatorial fire; still <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proves</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of purgatory in his dissertation against the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the Greeks, and the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a> also thought <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to affirm the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on the subject (<a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, "De Purgatorio," lib. I, cap. i). The modern <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Orthodox Church</a> denies purgatory, but is rather inconsistent in its way of putting forth its <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>.

<p>At the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> there was some hesitation especially on <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> part (Leipzig Disputation) as to whether the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> should be retained, but as the breach widened, the denial of purgatory by the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> became universal, and <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> termed the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> position "exitiale commentum quod crucem Christi evacuat . . . quod fidem nostram labefacit et evertit" (Institutiones, lib. III, cap. v, 6). Modern <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, while they avoid the name <em>purgatory</em>, frequently teach the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of "the middle state," and Martensen ("Christian Dogmatics," Edinburgh, 1890, p. 457) writes: "As no <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> leaves this present <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in a fully complete and prepared state, we must suppose that there is an intermediate state, a realm of progressive development, (?) in which <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are prepared for the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">final judgment</a>" (Farrar, "Mercy and Judgment," London, 1881, cap. iii).

<h2 id="iii">Proofs</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> of purgatory supposes the fact that some die with smaller faults for which there was no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> repentance, and also the fact that the temporal penalty due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is it times not wholly paid in this life. The <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> position, both in <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> and in <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a>, are bound up also with the practice of <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">praying for the dead</a>. For why <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">pray for the dead</a>, if there be no <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the power of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to afford solace to those who as yet are excluded from the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">sight of God</a>? So <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is this position that <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers for the dead</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a place of purgation are mentioned in conjunction in the oldest passages of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, who allege reasons for succouring departed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Those who have opposed the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of purgatory have confessed that <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers for the dead</a> would be an unanswerable argument if the modern <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of a <a href="../cathen/08550a.htm">"particular judgment"</a> had been received in the early ages. But one has only to read the testimonies hereinafter alleged to feel sure that the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> speak, in the same breath, of <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">oblations for the dead</a> and a place of purgation; and one has only to consult the evidence found in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> to feel equally sure that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian faith</a> there expressed embraced clearly a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/08550a.htm">judgment immediately after death</a>. Wilpert ("Roma Sotteranea," I, 441) thus concludes chapter 21, "Che tale esaudimento", etc.:<blockquote><p><a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">Intercession</a> has been made for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the dear one departed and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has heard the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has passed into a place of light and refreshment." "Surely," Wilpert adds, "such <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> would have no place were there question not of the <a href="../cathen/08550a.htm">particular</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">final judgment</a>. </p></blockquote>


<p>Some stress too has been laid upon the objection that the ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> had no clear conception of purgatory, and that they thought that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> departed remained in uncertainty of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">last day</a>; and consequently they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that those who had gone before might in the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">final judgment</a> escape even the everlasting torments of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. The earliest <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Christian traditions</a> are clear as to the <a href="../cathen/08550a.htm">particular judgment</a>, and clearer still concerning a sharp distinction between purgatory and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. The passages alledged as referring to relief from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> cannot offset the evidence given below (<a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, "De Purgatorio," lib. II, cap. v). Concerning the famous case of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a>, which vexed the Doctors of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, see <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, loc. cit., cap. Viii.
<h3>Old Testament</h3>

<p>The tradition of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> is put forth with precision and clearness in <a href="../bible/2ma000.htm">2 Maccabees</a>. <a href="../cathen/08541a.htm">Judas</a>, the commander of the forces of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,

<blockquote><p>making a gathering . . . sent twelve thousand drachmas of silver to Jerusalem for sacrifice to be offered for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the dead, thinking well and religiously concerning the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> (For if he had not <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hoped</a> that they that were slain should rise again, it would have seemed superfluous and vain to <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">pray for the dead</a>). And because he considered that they who had fallen asleep with godliness, had great grace laid up for them. It is therefore a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and wholesome thought to <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">pray for the dead</a>, that they may be loosed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. (<a href="../bible/2ma012.htm#vrs43">2 Maccabees 12:43-46</a>)</p></blockquote>

<p>At the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> of the Maccabees the leaders of the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had no hesitation in asserting the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers offered for the dead</a>, in order that those who had departed this life might find pardon for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">eternal resurrection</a>.
<h3>New Testament</h3>

<p>There are several passages in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> that point to a process of purification after death. Thus, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> declares (<a href="../bible/mat012.htm#vrs32">Matthew 12:32</a>): "And whosoever shall speak a word against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, it shall be forgiven him: but he that shall speak against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come." According to <a href="../cathen/08186a.htm">St. Isidore of Seville</a> (Deord. creatur., c. xiv, n. 6) these words <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">prove</a> that in the next life "some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> will be forgiven and purged away by a certain purifying fire." <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> also argues "that some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinners</a> are not forgiven either in this world or in the next would not be truly said unless there were other [<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinners</a>] who, though not forgiven in this world, are forgiven in the world to come" (<a href="../fathers/120121.htm"><em>City of God</em> XXI.24</a>). The same interpretation is given by <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> (Dial., IV, xxxix); <a href="../cathen/02384a.htm">St. Bede</a> (commentary on this text); <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> (Sermo lxvi in Cantic., n. 11) and other eminent <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> writers.

<p>A further argument is supplied by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> in <a href="../bible/1co003.htm#vrs11">1 Corinthians 3:11-15</a>:
<blockquote><p>
"For other foundation no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> can lay, but that which is laid; which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>. Now if any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay stubble: Every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> work shall be manifest; for the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire; and the fire shall try every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> work, of what sort it is. If any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.

<p>While this passage presents considerable difficulty, it is regarded by many of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> as evidence for the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of an intermediate state in which the dross of lighter <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">transgressions</a> will be burnt away, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> thus purified will be <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">saved</a>. This, according to <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> (De Purg., I, 5), is the interpretation commonly given by the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>; and he cites to this effect: <ul><li><a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a> (commentary on the text, and Sermo xx in Ps. cxvii), <li><a href="../cathen/08341a.htm">St. Jerome</a>, (Comm. in Amos, c. iv), <li><a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> (<a href="../fathers/1801037.htm"><em>Enarration on Psalm 37</em></a>), <li><a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory</a> (Dial., IV, xxxix), and <li><a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> (Hom. vi in Exod.).</ul> See also <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, "Contra Gentes,", IV, 91.

<h3>Tradition</h3>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> that many who have died are still in a place of purification and that <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers</a> avail to help the dead is part of the very earliest <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Christian tradition</a>. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> <a href="../fathers/0304.htm">"De corona militis"</a> mentions <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers for the dead</a> as an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> ordinance, and in <a href="../fathers/0406.htm">"De Monogamia" (chapter 10)</a> he advises a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> "to <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">pray for the soul</a> of her husband, begging repose for him and participation in the first resurrection"; he commands her also "to make oblations for him on the anniversary of his demise," and charges her with infidelity if she neglect to succour his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. This settled <a href="../cathen/04576a.htm">custom</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is clear from <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a>, who (P.L. IV, col. 399) forbade the customary <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers</a> for one who had violated the ecclesiastical law. "Our predecessors prudently advised that no brother, departing this life, should nominate any <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">churchman</a> as his executor; and should he do it, that no oblation should be made for him, nor sacrifice offered for his repose." Long before <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, <a href="../cathen/04045a.htm">Clement of Alexandria</a> had puzzled over the question of the state or <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> who, reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on his death-bed, had no <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> for the fulfilment of penance due his transgression. His answer is: "the believer through <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> divests himself of his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and passes to the mansion which is better than the former one, passes to the greatest torment, taking with him the characteristic of repentance for the faults he may have committed after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. He is tortured then still more, not yet attaining what he sees others have acquired. The greatest torments are assigned to the believer, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> righteousness is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> righteous, and though these punishments cease in the course of the expiation and purification of each one, "yet" etc. (P.G. IX, col. 332).

<p>In <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of purgatory is very clear. If a man departs this life with lighter faults, he is condemned to fire which burns away the lighter materials, and prepares the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, where nothing defiled may enter. "For if on the foundation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> you have built not only gold and silver and precious stones (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm">1 Corinthians 3</a>); but also wood and hay and stubble, what do you expect when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be separated from the body? Would you enter into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> with your wood and hay and stubble and thus defile the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>; or on account of these hindrances would you remain without and receive no reward for your gold and silver and precious stones? Neither is this <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a>. It remains then that you be committed to the fire which will burn the light materials; for our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to those who can comprehend <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heavenly</a> things is called a cleansing fire. But this fire consumes not the creature, but what the creature has himself built, wood and hay and stubble. It is manifest that the fire destroys the wood of our transgressions and then returns to us the reward of our great works." (P.G., XIII, col. 445, 448).

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> practice of <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">praying for the dead</a> which passed into the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is as clear in the fourth century as it is in the twentieth. <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">St. Cyril of Jerusalem</a> (<a href="../fathers/310105.htm"><em>Mystagogical Catechesis</em> V.9</a>) describing the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a>, writes: "Then we <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">pray</a> for the Holy Fathers and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishops</a> that are dead; and in short for all those who have departed this life in our communion; <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of those for whom <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers</a> are offered receive very great relief, while this <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">holy and tremendous victim</a> lies upon the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>." <a href="../cathen/07016a.htm">St. Gregory of Nyssa</a> (P.G., XLVI, col. 524, 525) states that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> weaknesses are purged in this life by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and wisdom, or are expiated in the next by a cleansing fire. "When he has quitted his body and the difference between <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> he cannot approach <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> till the purging fire shall have cleansed the stains with which his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was infested. That same fire in others will cancel the corruption of matter, and the propensity to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>." About the same <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> the <a href="../cathen/01636a.htm">Apostolic Constitution</a> gives us the formularies used in <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">succouring the dead</a>. "Let us <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">pray</a> for our brethren who sleep in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who in his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> has received the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the departed one, may forgive him every fault, and in mercy and clemency receive him into the <a href="../cathen/01055a.htm">bosom of Abraham</a>, with those who in this life have pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" (P.G. I, col. 1144). Nor can we pass over the use of the <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptychs</a> where the names of the dead were inscribed; and this remembrance by name in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacred Mysteries</a>--(a practice that was from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a>) was considered by <a href="../cathen/08452b.htm">Chrysostom</a> as the best way of relieving the dead (<a href="../fathers/220141.htm"><em>Homily 41 on First Corinthians</em>, no. 8</a>).

<p>The teaching of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>, and the formularies used in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, found expression in the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> monuments, particularly those contained in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a>. On the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> were inscribed words of <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, words of petition for peace and for rest; and as the anniversaries came round the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> gathered at the graves of the departed to make <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> for those who had gone before. At the bottom this is nothing else than the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> expressed by the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXV, "De Purgatorio"), and to this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">inscriptions</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> are surely witnesses.

<p>In the fourth century in the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a>, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a> insists in his <a href="../cathen/04157a.htm">commentary</a> on <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1co003.htm">1 Corinthians 3</a>) on the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of purgatory, and in his masterly funeral oration (De obitu Theodosii), thus <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prays</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">departed emperor</a>: "Give, O <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, rest to Thy servant <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a>, that rest Thou hast prepared for Thy <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. . . . I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> him, therefore will I follow him to the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">land of the living</a>; I will not leave him till by my <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers</a> and lamentations he shall be admitted unto the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">holy mount of the Lord</a>, to which his deserts call him" (P.L., XVI, col. 1397). <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> is clearer even than his master. He describes two <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; "some there are who have departed this life, not so bad as to be deemed unworthy of mercy, nor so <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as to be entitled to immediate <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>" etc., and in the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a> he says there will be some who "have gone through these pains, to which the <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirits</a> of the dead are liable" (<a href="../fathers/120121.htm"><em>City of God</em> XXI.24</a>). Thus at the close of the fourth century:

<ul>
<li>not only were <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers for the dead</a> found in all the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgies</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> asserted that such practice was from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostles</a> themselves;
<li>those who were helped by the <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> and by the celebration of the Holy Mysteries were in a place of purgation;
<li>from which when purified they "were admitted unto the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Holy Mount of the Lord</a>".
</ul>

<p>So clear is this <a href="../cathen/11560a.htm">patristic</a> <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a> that those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in purgatory have been unable to bring any serious difficulties from the writings of the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>. The passages cited to the contrary either do not touch the question at all, or are so lacking in clearness that they cannot offset the perfectly open expression of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> as found in the very <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> who are quoted as holding contrary opinions (<a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> "De Purg.", lib. I, cap. xiii).

<h2 id="iv">Duration and nature</h2>

<h3>Duration</h3>

<p>The very reasons assigned for the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of purgatory make for its passing character. We <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">pray</a>, we offer sacrifice for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> therein detained that "<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in mercy may forgive every fault and receive them into the <a href="../cathen/01055a.htm">bosom of Abraham</a>" (<a href="../fathers/0715.htm"><em>Apostolic Constitutions</em></a>); and Augustine (<a href="../fathers/120121.htm"><em>City of God</em> XXI.13, 16</a>) declares that the punishment of purgatory is temporary and will cease, at least with the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">Last Judgment</a>. "But temporary punishments are suffered by some in this life only, by others after death, by others both now and then; but all of them before that last and strictest judgment."
<h3>Nature of punishment</h3>

<p>It is clear from the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgies</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> above cited that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> for whose peace sacrifice was offered were shut out for the time being from the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">sight of God</a>. They were "not so <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as to be entitled to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">eternal happiness</a>". Still, for them "death is the termination not of <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> but of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>" (<a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">Ambrose</a>, "De obitu Theodos."); and this inability to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> makes them secure of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">final happiness</a>. This is the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> position proclaimed by <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Exurge Domine" which condemned the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>.

<p>Are the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> detained in purgatory <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">conscious</a> that their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is but deferred for a time, or may they still be in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerning their ultimate <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? The ancient <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">Liturgies</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">inscriptions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> speak of a "sleep of peace", which would be impossible if there was any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of ultimate <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Some of the Doctors of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> thought uncertainty of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> one of the severe punishments of purgatory. (<a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, "De Purgat." lib. II, cap. iv); but this opinion finds no general credit among the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval period</a>, nor is it possible in the light of the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08550a.htm">particular judgment</a>. <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> gives as the reason for this elimination of fear and of uncertainty the intimate conviction that they can no longer <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (lib. IV, dist. xx, p.1, a.1 q. iv): "Est evacuatio timoris propter confirniationem liberi arbitrii, qua deinceps scit se peccare non posse" (Fear is cast out because of the strengthening of the will by which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> knows it can no longer <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>), and <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (dist. xxi, q. i, a.1) says: "nisi scirent se esse liberandas suffragia non peterent" (unless they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that they are to be delivered, they would not ask for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>).
<h3>Merit</h3>

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Exurge Domine" <a href="../cathen/09162a.htm">Leo X</a> condemns the proposition (n. 38) "Nec probatum est ullis aut rationibus aut scripturis ipsas esse extra statum merendi aut augendae caritatis" (There is no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> from <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">reason</a> or <a href="../cathen/13635b.htm">Scripture</a> that they [the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in purgatory] cannot <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> or increase in charity). For them "the night has come in which no man can labour", and <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Christian tradition</a> has always considered that only in this life can <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> work unto the profit of his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The Doctors of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> while agreeing that this life is the <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> for <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> and increase of grace, still some with <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> seemed to question whether or not there might be some non-essential reward which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in purgatory might <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> (IV, dist. xxi, q. i, a. 3). <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that in this matter <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> changed his opinion and refers to a statement of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> ("De Malo", q. vii, a. 11). Whatever may be the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">Angelic Doctor</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> agree that no <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> is possible in purgatory, and if objection be urged that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> there <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> by their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> says that such <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> avail with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> because of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> already acquired "Solum impetrant ex meritis praeteritis quomodo nunc sancti orando) pro nobis impetrant licet non merendo" (They avail only in virtue of past <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> as those who are now <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercede</a> for us not by <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> but by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>). (loc. cit. II, cap. iii).
<h3>Purgatorial fire</h3>

<p>At the <a href="../cathen/06111a.htm">Council of Florence</a>, <a href="../cathen/02527b.htm">Bessarion</a> argued against the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of real purgatorial fire, and the Greeks were assured that the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a> had never issued any <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> on this subject. In the <a href="../cathen/09022a.htm">West</a> the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of real fire is common. Augustine (<a href="../fathers/1801037.htm"><em>Enarration on Psalm 37</em>, no. 3</a>) speaks of the pain which purgatorial fire causes as more severe than anything a man can suffer in this life, "gravior erit ignis quam quidquid potest homo pati in hac vita" (P.L., col. 397). <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> speaks of those who after this life "will expiate their faults by purgatorial flames," and he adds "that the pain be more intolerable than any one can suffer in this life" (Ps. 3 poenit., n. 1). Following in the footsteps of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory</a>, <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> teaches (IV, dist. xxi, q. i, a.1) that besides the separation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">sight of God</a>, there is the other punishment from fire. "Una poena damni, in quantum scilicet retardantur a divina visione; alia sensus secundum quod ab igne punientur", and <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> not only agrees with <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> but adds (IV, dist. xx, p.1, a.1, q. ii) that this punishment by fire is more severe than any punishment which comes to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in this life; "Gravior est omni temporali poena. quam modo sustinet anima carni conjuncta". How this fire affects the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the departed the Doctors do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and in such matters it is well to heed the warning of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> when it commands the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> "to exclude from their preaching difficult and subtle questions which tend not to edification', and from the discussion of which there is no increase either in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">devotion</a>" (Sess. XXV, "De Purgatorio").

<h2 id="v">Succouring the dead</h2>

<p><a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a> command <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">oblations for the departed</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXV, "De Purgatorio") in virtue of this <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> not only asserts the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of purgatory, but adds "that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> therein detained are aided by the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> and principally by the acceptable sacrifice of the altar." That those on earth are still in <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">communion</a> with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in purgatory is the earliest <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian teaching</a>, and that the living aid the dead by their <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers</a> and works of satisfaction is clear from the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> above alleged. That the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice</a> was offered for the departed was received <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">Tradition</a> even in the days of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead, were aided particularly "while the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">sacred victim</a> lay upon the <a href="../cathen/01362a.htm">altar</a>" is the expression of <a href="../cathen/04595b.htm">Cyril of Jerusalem</a> quoted above. Augustine (Serm. clxii, n. 2) says that the "<a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">Holy Sacrifice of the altar</a> aid the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> departed and move the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a> to deal with them in mercy and kindness, and," he adds, "this is the practice of the universal <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> handed down by the <a href="../cathen/06001a.htm">Fathers</a>." Whether our works of satisfaction performed on behalf of the dead avail purely out of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> benevolence and mercy, or whether <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliges</a> himself in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to accept our vicarious <a href="../cathen/02055a.htm">atonement</a>, is not a settled question. <a href="../cathen/14319a.htm">Francisco Su&aacute;rez</a> thinks that the acceptance is one of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and alleges the common practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which joins together the living and the dead without any discrimination (De poenit., disp. xlviii, 6, n. 4).

<h2 id="vi">Indulgences</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. XXV) defined that <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are "most salutary for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people" and that their "use is to be retained in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>". It is the common teaching of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> that <ul> <li><a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> may be applied to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> detained in purgatory; and <li>that <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> are available for them "by way of suffrage" (per modum suffragii). </ul>

<p>(1) Augustine (<a href="../fathers/120120.htm"><em>City of God</em> XX.9</a>) declares that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> departed are not separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of Christ</a>, and for this reason the <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers</a> and works of the living are helpful to the dead. "If therefore", argues <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> (De indulgentiis, xiv) "we can offer our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and our satisfactions in behalf of those detained in purgatory, because we are members of the great body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, why may not the <a href="../cathen/15403b.htm">Vicar of Christ</a> apply to the same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> the superabundant satisfaction of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and his <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>--of which he is the dispenser?" This is the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (IV, Sent., dist. xlv, q. ii, a. 3, q. 2) who asserts that <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> avail principally for the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who performs the work for which the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is given, if they but secondarily may avail even for the dead, if the form in which the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> is granted be so worded as to be capable of such interpretation, and he adds "nor is there any reason why the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may not dispose of its treasure of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merits</a> in favour of the dead, as it surely dispenses it in favour of the living".

<p>(2) <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> (IV, Sent., dist. xx, p. 2, q. v) agrees with <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, but adds that such "relaxation cannot be after the manner of <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> as in the case of the living but only as suffrage (Haec non tenet modum judicii, sed potius suffragii). This opinion of <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> through its <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Supreme Pastor</a> does not <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> juridically the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in purgatory from the punishment due their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is the teaching of the Doctors. They point out (Gratian, 24 q. ii, 2, can.1) that in case of those who have departed this life, judgment is reserved to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; they allege the authority of <a href="../cathen/06407a.htm">Gelasius</a> (Ep. ad Fausturn; Ep. ad. Episcopos Dardaniae) in support of their contention (Gratian ibid.), and they also insist that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman Pontiffs</a>, when they grant <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> that are applicable to the dead, add the restriction "per modum suffragii et deprecationis". This phrase is found in the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a> "Romani Pontificis provida diligentia", 27 Nov. 1447.

<p>The phrase "per modum suffragi et deprecationis" has been variously interpreted by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> (<a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, "De indulgentiis", p.137). <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> himself says: "The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> opinion is that <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> avail as suffrage, because they avail not after the fashion of a juridical <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolution</a> 'quia non prosunt per modum juridicae absolutionis'." But according to the same author the suffrages of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> avail at times "per modum meriti congrui" (by way of <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a>), at times "per modum impetrationis" (by way of supplication) at times "per modum satisfactionis" (by way of satisfaction); but when there is question of applying an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> to one in purgatory it is only "per modum suffragii satisfactorii" and for this reason "the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> does not <a href="../cathen/01061a.htm">absolve</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in purgatory from the punishment due his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but offers to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from the treasure of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> whatever may be <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for the cancelling of this punishment".

<p>If the question be further asked whether such satisfaction is accepted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> out of mercy and benevolence, or "ex justitia", <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> are not in accord &mdash; some holding one opinion, others the other. <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> after canvassing both sides (pp. 137, 138) does not dare to set aside "either opinion, but is inclined to think that the former is more reasonable while he pronounces the latter in harmony with piety ("admodum pia").
<h3>Condition</h3>

<p>That an <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> may avail for those in purgatory several <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> are required: <ul><li>The <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> must be granted by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. <li>There must be a sufficient reason for granting the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>, and this reason must be something pertaining to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the utility of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not merely the utility accruing to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in purgatory. <li>The <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> work enjoined must be as in the case of <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a> for the living.</ul>

<p>If the state of grace be not among the required works, in all probability the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> performing the work may gain the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a> for the dead, even though he himself be not in friendship with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (<a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, loc. cit., p. 139). <a href="../cathen/14319a.htm">Francisco Su&aacute;rez</a> (De Poenit., disp. Iiii, s. 4, n. 5 and 6) puts this categorically when he says: "Status gratiae solum requiritur ad tollendum obicem indulgentiae" (the state of grace is required only to remove some hindrance to the <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgence</a>), and in the case of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> there can be no hindrance. This teaching is bound up with the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">Communion of Saints</a>, and the monuments of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">catacombs</a> represent the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> as <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">interceding</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the dead. The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> too of the early <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> speak of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">interceding</a> for those who have passed from this life. Augustine <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">burial</a> in a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> <a href="../cathen/04673a.htm">dedicated</a> to a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> is of value to the dead, for those who recall the <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> of him who has suffered will recommend to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of him who has departed this life (<a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, lib. II, xv). In the same place <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> accuses <a href="../cathen/14152a.htm">Dominicus A Soto</a> of rashness, because he denied this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>.

<h2 id="vii">Invocation of souls</h2>

<p>Do the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in purgatory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us? May we call upon them in our needs? There is no decision of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on this subject, nor have the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> pronounced with definiteness concerning the invocation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in purgatory and their <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> for the living. In the ancient <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgies</a> there are no <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> directed to those who are still in purgatory. On the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> nothing is more common than a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> or a supplication asking the departed to <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercede</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for surviving friends, but these <a href="../cathen/08042a.htm">inscriptions</a> seem always to suppose that the departed one is already with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (<a href="../summa/3083.htm#article11">II-II.83.11</a>) denies that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in purgatory <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the living, and states they are not in a position to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, rather we must make <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> for them. Despite the authority of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, many renowned <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> hold that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in purgatory really <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, and that we may invoke their aid. <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> (De Purgatorio, lib. II, xv,) says the reason alleged by <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> is not at all convincing, and holds that in virtue of their greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and their union with Him their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> may have great <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercessory</a> power, for they are really superior to us in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in intimacy of union with Him. <a href="../cathen/14319a.htm">Francisco Su&aacute;rez</a> (De poenit., disp. xlvii, s. 2, n. 9) goes farther and asserts "that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in purgatory are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, are dear to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> us with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and are mindful of our wants; that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in a general way our necessities and our dangers, and how great is our need of divine help and divine grace".

<p>When there is question of invoking the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of those in purgatory, <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a> (loc. cit.) says it is superfluous, ordinarily speaking, for they are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of our circumstances and <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a>. This is at variance with the opinion of <a href="../cathen/14319a.htm">Francisco Su&aacute;rez</a>, who admits <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> at least in a general way, also with the opinions of many modern <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> who point to the practice now common with almost all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> of addressing their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and petitions for help to those who are still in a place of purgation. Scavini (Theol. Moral., XI, n. 174) sees no reason why the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> detained in purgatory may not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, even as we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for one another. He asserts that this practice has become common at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and that it has the great name of <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus</a> in its favour. <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus</a> in his work the "Great Means of Salvation", chap. I, III, 2, after quoting <a href="../cathen/14373a.htm">Sylvius</a>, <a href="../cathen/16041d.htm">Gotti</a>, <a href="../cathen/09192a.htm">Lessius</a>, and Medina as favourable to his opinion, concludes: "so the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in purgatory, being beloved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and confirmed in grace, have absolutely no impediment to prevent them from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for us. Still the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not invoke them or implore their <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a>, because ordinarily they have no cognizance of our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. But we may piously <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> makes our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them". He alleges also the authority of <a href="../cathen/03446a.htm">St. Catharine of Bologna</a> who "whenever she desired any favour had recourse to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in purgatory, and was immediately heard".

<h2 id="viii">Utility of prayer for the departed</h2>

<p>It is the <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">traditional</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in purgatory are not separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which is the bond of union between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> members should embrace those who have departed this life in <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">God's grace</a>. Hence, since our <a href="../cathen/04653a.htm">prayers</a> and our <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> can help those who are still waiting in purgatory, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have not hesitated to warn us that we have a real <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> toward those who are still in purgatorial expiation. <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Holy Church</a> through the Congregation of Indulgences, 18 December 1885, has bestowed a special <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessing</a> on the so-called <a href="../cathen/07292b.htm">"heroic act"</a> in virtue of which "a member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> militant offers to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in purgatory all the satisfactory works which he will perform during his lifetime, and also all the suffrages which may accrue to him after his death" (Heroic Act, vol. VII, 292). The practice of devotion to the dead is also consoling to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">humanity</a> and eminently worthy of a religion which seconds all the purest feelings of the human heart. "Sweet", says <a href="../cathen/15670a.htm">Cardinal Wiseman</a> (lecture XI), "is the consolation of the dying man, who, <a href="../cathen/04274a.htm">conscious</a> of imperfection, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that there are others to make <a href="../cathen/08070a.htm">intercession</a> for him, when his own <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> for <a href="../cathen/10202b.htm">merit</a> has expired; soothing to the afflicted survivors the thought that they possess powerful means of relieving their friend. In the first moments of grief, this sentiment will often overpower religious prejudice, cast down the unbeliever on his knees beside the remains of his friend and snatch from him an unconscious <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for rest; it is an impulse of nature which for the moment, aided by the <a href="../cathen/01449a.htm">analogies</a> of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, seizes at once upon this consoling <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. But it is only a flitting and melancholy light, while the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> feeling, cheering though with solemn dimness, resembles the unfailing lamp, which the piety of the ancients is said to have hung before the sepulchres of their dead."
