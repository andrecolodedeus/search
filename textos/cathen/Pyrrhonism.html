<h1>Pyrrhonism</h1>  

<p>Pyrrhonism is a system of scepticism, the founder of which was Pyrrho, a Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, about whom very little is known except that he died in 270 <font size=-2>B.C.</font> The best known of Pyrrho's disciples was Timon of Philius, known as the sillographer. Pyrrho's scepticism was so complete and comprehensive that the word Pyrrhonism is sometimes used as a synonym for scepticism, The scepticism of Pyrrho's <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> covered three points. <ul><li>All the dogmatists, that is to say, all the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who believed that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and certitude can be attained, were mere <a href="../cathen/14145c.htm">sophists</a>; they were self-deceived and deceivers of others. <br><li>Certitude is impossible of attainment, not only because of the possibility that our faculties deceive us, but also because, in themselves, things are neither one thing nor the other, neither good nor <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, beautiful nor ugly, large nor small. Or, rather, things are both <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, beautiful and ugly, large and small, so that there is no reason why we should affirm that they are one thing rather than the other. This conviction was expressed in the famous saying, <em>ouden mallon</em>, nothing is more one thing than another; the paper is not more white than black, the piece of sugar is not more sweet than bitter, and so forth. <br><li>The reality of things being inaccessible to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and certitude being impossible of attainment, the wise man <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> about everything; that is, he recognizes the futility of inquiry into reality and abstains from judging. This abstention is called <em>epoche</em>. It is the foundation of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Because he alone can attain <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> who cultivates imperturbability, <em>ataraxia</em>; and then only is the mind <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> against disquietude when we realize that every attempt to attain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is doomed to failure.</ul>

<p>From this account of the principles of Pyrrhonism, it is evident that Pyrrho's aim was <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a>. Like all the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of the period in which he lived, he concerned himself principally with the problem of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> sought to found <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> on the realization of the reign of law in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> as well as in nature. The <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a> grounded <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> on the conviction that transitory feeling is the one important phenomenon in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. The Eclectics placed the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> basis of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in the conviction that all systems of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> are equally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. The Pyrrhonist, as well as the other <a href="../cathen/13516b.htm">sceptics</a> of that period, believed that there is no possibility of attaining <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> unless one first realizes that all systems of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> are equally <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and that the real <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of things cannot be attained. Pyrrhonism is, therefore, an abdication of all the supposed <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the mind, and cannot be dealt with by the ordinary rules of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a> or by the customary canons of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> criticism.
