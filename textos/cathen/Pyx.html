<h1>Pyx</h1>  

<p>The word <em>pyx</em> (Lat., <em>pyxis</em>, which transliterates the Greek, <em>pyxis</em>, box-wood receptacle, from <em>pyxos</em>, box-tree) was formerly applied in a wide and general sense to all vessels used to contain the Blessed Eucharist. In particular it was perhaps the commonest term applied to the cup in which the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> actually rested when in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it was suspended above the altar. Thus the Custumal of Cluny in the eleventh century speaks of the "<a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> taking the golden pyx (<em>auream pyxidem</em>) out of the dove (<em>columba</em>) which hangs permanently above the altar". In later times however it has come about that the term pyx is limited in ordinary usage to that smaller vessel of gold, or silver-gilt, in which the Eucharist is commonly carried to the sick. Such vessels are sometimes made flat like a watch, sometimes mounted upon a little stand like a miniature <a href="../cathen/03767a.htm">ciborium</a>. From the resemblance in size and shape the word pyx is also used to denote the small silver vessel or <em>custode</em> in which the Sacred Host is commonly kept in the Tabernacle, that it may be transferred thence to the <a href="../cathen/11344a.htm">monstrance</a> when the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a> is exposed for the service of Benediction. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> pyxes for carrying the Eucharist to the sick were not unfrequently made of <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a>. In spite of synodal decrees it is to be feared that there were many <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a> both in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> and later times which preserved no proper pyx for taking <a href="../cathen/15397c.htm">Viaticum</a> to the sick. In these cases the custom seems to have prevailed, even if it was not officially tolerated, of carrying the Host wrapped in a corporal in a <a href="../cathen/03084b.htm">burse</a> which was suspended round the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> neck or even of placing it between the leaves of a breviary.

<p>The "pyx-cover", or "pyx-cloth", of which we sometimes read in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> inventories, was a veil which hung over the pyx as it was suspended above the altar, and it was consequently a cloth of considerable size. At the present day the pyx when carried secretly to the sick, as is the case in most <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> and many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> countries, is generally carried in a <a href="../cathen/03084b.htm">burse</a> or pyx-bag, i.e. a silken bag suspended round the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> neck within which the pyx is wrapped in a diminutive corporal used for that purpose.
