<p>(DAUGHTERS OF THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN, FILI&AElig; REGIN&AElig; COELI)

<p>A religious and charitable <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> founded at St. Louis, Mo., 5 Dec., 1889, by Miss Mary Hoxsey. It was organized to supplement the work done for the poor in their homes by the members of the <a href="../cathen/13389a.htm">Conference of St. Vincent de Paul</a>. The project received the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> and encouragement of the Very Rev. P.P. Brady in whose <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> it was inaugurated, and several years later the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> sanction and blessing were accorded (17 July, 1894). The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> has since spread to numerous <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> and there are now thirty-five associations affiliated to those at St. Louis. The constitution of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> provides that it shall be governed by a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> composed of subordinate councils and associations. Five or more associations in a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> have the right of forming a subordinate council with its own bylaws and officers. The <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was incorporated on 6 Jan., 1902. The Queen's Daughters visit the poor in their homes and afford them spiritual and material aid. They endeavour to influence those who neglect their religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> or the religious training of their children, they teach <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> in mission Sunday-schools, and assist in preparing <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and in providing suitable clothing for the first Communion of children whose <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> are unable to make such provision. Their organizations include sewing-guilds, cooking-schools, boarding-homes for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and girls, sanctuary guilds and altar <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>. At their Saturday industrial <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> for children the children of the poor are taught to sew and be self-helpful. Here also they are brought in contact with the members of the Guardian Angel Bands, the children of well-to-do <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, who are taught to make garments for the poor and to be generally helpful and sympathetic to their poorer companions. The usual work in connexion with juvenile courts is done according to instructions provided by court officials. The members of several religious congregations are honorary members of the association. Representative of these are the White Sisters of the Nazareth Home, <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Providence</a>, R.I., who maintain a day nursery and visit the sick poor in their homes and to whom the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is pledged to contribute a specified sum monthly. The patroness of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>; and its motto "Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam".
