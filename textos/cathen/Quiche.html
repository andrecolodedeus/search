<h1>Quiche</h1>  

<p>(UTLATECA)

<p>The principal aboriginal tribe or nation of <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>. They belong to the great Mayan linguistic stock (see <a href="../cathen/10082b.htm">MAYA INDIANS</a>), as do also their neighbours in the same state, the Cakchiquel, Pokonchi, and Tzutnhil, the four dialects constituting but one language. The Quiche occupied north-central <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, including the present districts of Quiche, Totonicapan, and a part of Quezaltenango. Like those of the other Mayan tribes, their traditions pointed to a northern or north-eastern origin, and their fairly authentic history went back to about A.D. 700. (Maya history seems fairly authentic as far back as the second century.) They were subjugated by <a href="../cathen/01372d.htm">Pedro de Alvarado</a> about 1525, with even more than the customary atrocities, and rapidly declined under the system of slavery and heavy tribute imposed, notwithstanding the warnings of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the humane <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> by the Spanish monarch, at the instance of <a href="../cathen/03397a.htm">Las Casas</a>. Even before the conquest was complete the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fathers Pontaz and de Torres had taken up their residence among the Quiche and begun the work of Christianization. In 1530 Father Francisco Marroqu&iacute;n (d. 1563) arrived from <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> to organize the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/07054a.htm">Guatemala</a>, and in 1533 was confirmed as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. He gave special attention to the Indians and their languages, becoming particularly proficient in the Quiche, into which language he translated the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a>. On his appeal <a href="../cathen/03397a.htm">Father Las Casas</a> (1536) established at <a href="../cathen/13460a.htm">Santiago</a> a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> for the conversion of the natives. They were reinforced two years later by Fathers Zambrano and Dardon, of the Order of Mercy (<em>Merced</em>), who established a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of that order in the same city. Under these two orders, working in harmony together with the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, who entered the field in 1541, the conversion of the Indians was gradually effected, the new converts being gathered into towns for their better government and instruction. The entire tribe is long since <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, although many of the ancient rites and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> persist in daily life. Their present number is near 150,000.

<p>In agricultural habit, architecture, literary method and productiveness, religious ceremonial, and general culture, the ancient Quiche resembled the Maya, with only minor differences. In their genesis myth (as recorded in the "Popol Vuh"), the earth was brought into form by Gugumatz, the Plumed Serpent (equivalent to the <em>Quetzalevat</em>t of the <a href="../cathen/02169b.htm">Aztec</a>), who finally created four men and four <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who became the ancestors of the race, assigning to each pair at the same time a special tutelary god, whose first <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it was to produce fire and light, to clear the world of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> monsters and to institute Ceremonies and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>.

<p>The "Popol Vuh", or "National Book", the great literary monument of the Quiche, is a compendium of their ancient traditions handed down from before the conquest. The present version, evidently a copy from an older record, was written in the Quiche language by one of the tribe, apparently shortly after the conquest. it was first brought to attention through a Spanish translation by the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Father Francisco Xim&eacute;nez (c. 1725). In 1861 a more correct French translation, with the original text, was published in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> by the Abb&eacute; Brasseur de Bourbourg. Of the work Brinton says: "This may well be considered one of the most valuable monuments of ancient American literature and its substantial authenticity cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>."
