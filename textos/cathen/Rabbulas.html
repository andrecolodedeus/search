<h1>Rabbulas</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> and, in the later years of his life, one of the foremost opponents of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>. He was the son of a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> mother. He was converted by Eusebius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Chalcis (his native town), and Acacius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01283b.htm">Aleppo</a>. After his <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> he became a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. For a time he was a devoted admirer of <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, but there was some quarrel, the details which are not known, and Theodore publicly rebuked him at a synod. In 412 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> and died in 435. According to the anonymous panegyrist who wrote his Life, he from the first took a decided stand against Nestorius and denounced the heresiarch to his face. At the Council of Ephesus, however, he was on the side of <a href="../cathen/08468a.htm">John of Antioch</a>, and his name is found among the subscriptions to two letters (Labbe, I, p. 1532 and p. 1557) in which St. Cyril's <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is denounced as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>. But a few months later he realized that St. Cyril was in the right, and became his most uncompromising ally against <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>. His task was not an easy one, for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>, owing chiefly to the prestige of <a href="../cathen/14571b.htm">Theodore of Mopsuestia</a>, was a stronghold of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorianism</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> with which Rabbulas endeavoured to suppress Theodore's writings was unfairly attributed by Ibas, in his letters to Maris, to personal rancour against the memory of the deceased (Ibas' letter was read at the Council of Chalcedon and may be found in Labbe, <a href="../cathen/07135c.htm">Hardouin</a>, <a href="../cathen/09609c.htm">Mansi</a>, or Hefele). Most of the surviving works of Rabbulas were published by Overbeck, "S. Ephraemi Syri, Rabulae Episc. Edesseni, Bal&aelig;ei aliorumque opera selecta" (Oxford, 1865). Rabbulas' Syriac translation of St. Cyril's "De Fide Recta" was first published by Philip <a href="../cathen/12582a.htm">Pusey</a> (Oxford, 1877). Most of the writings of Rabbulas were translated into German by <a href="../cathen/16010a.htm">Bickell</a> in <a href="../cathen/14554a.htm">Thalhofer's</a> "Bibliothek der Kirchenv&auml;ter". According to Burkitt, "St. Ephraim's quotations from the Gospel" (Cambridge Texts and Studies, VII, 2) and "Evangelion Da Mephareshe" (Cambridge, 1901), Rabbulas was the author of the Peshitto. The chief authority for his Life is an anonymous panegyric composed soon after his death by a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>. This was published by Overbeck and translated by <a href="../cathen/16010a.htm">Bickell</a>.
