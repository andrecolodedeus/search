<h1>Radulph of Rivo</h1>  

<p>(or OF TONGRES; RADULPH VAN DER BEEKE)

<p>An historian and liturgist, born at <a href="../cathen/02752a.htm">Breda</a>, in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Brabant, about the middle of the fourteenth century; died at Tongres, 3 Nov., 1403. He pursued his studies in various parts of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> &mdash; in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, where he was in 1362, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and at <a href="../cathen/11318b.htm">Orl&eacute;ans</a> (1367-75), where he studied canon and <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. In 1371 at the latest he was <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">subdeacon</a>. Invested in 1371 with the deanery of Tongres by a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> of <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a>, he took possession of his charge in 1383. In the interval he returned to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>; in 1381 he was still at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, where he had as master Simon of Constantinople, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14562b.htm">Thebes</a>, who taught him Greek. After 1390 he was replaced at Tongres by a vice-dean. During this time he had matriculated at the new <a href="../cathen/04120a.htm">University of Cologne</a> (founded in 1388), where for a time he was <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> (1397). He made his last journey to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> somewhat prior to that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a>. In 1398 he returned to Tongres, where he resumed his <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as <a href="../cathen/04659a.htm">dean</a>. Here he occupied himself, as during his first stay, with firm and enlightened <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the maintenance of <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">discipline</a> during the period disturbed by the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/13539a.htm">Great Schism of the West</a>. He exerted himself especially for the reform of the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgy</a>. He was the friend, protector, and guide of the new institutions of Windersheim and Corsendonck. Several of his works date from this period, while his <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> writings were chiefly composed during his second stay at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04060a.htm">cloisters</a> of the church of Ste-Marie at Tongres.

<p>Radulph wrote a great deal. Besides some works on grammar, mention must be made of his chronicle of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> published by Chapeaville (3 vols., Li&egrave;ge, 1612-16) and his <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> works. The last-named are the most important and the best of his writings, especially for the history of the <a href="../cathen/02768b.htm">Breviary</a> and the Mass. Here he displays a great spirit of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, showing at the same time much critical ability, learning, and wide reading. He is decidedly in favour of maintaining ancient Roman <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> customs and rejects recent modifications. Among his writings (many still unedited) especially notable are: "Liber de canonum observantia" (ed. Hilthorp, Cologne, 1508, and in "Maxima Patrum Bibliotheca", <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, vol. XXVI, 289); "Calendarius ecclesiasticus Generalis" (Louvain, 1508); "De psalterio observando" and "Liber de Officiis ecclesiasticis", the last two unpublished.
