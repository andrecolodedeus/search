<h1>Raffaelo Maffei</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">Humanist</a>, historian and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. 17 February, 1451; d. 25 January, 1522. He was a native of <a href="../cathen/15504b.htm">Volterra</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and therefore is called Raphael Volaterranus. From earliest youth he devoted himself to the study of letters, and in 1466 was called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, with his brothers, by their father Gherardo Maffei, whom <a href="../cathen/12126c.htm">Pius II</a> had appointed professor of law at the <a href="../cathen/13177a.htm">University of Rome</a>, and had taken later for his secretary, which position he held also under <a href="../cathen/11578a.htm">Paul II</a> and <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> Raffaelo held himself aloof from the court, devoting his <a href="../cathen/14726a.htm">time</a> to the practice of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and to the study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> and of the Greek language, the latter under <a href="../cathen/06456a.htm">George of Trebizond</a>. In 1477, he went to <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a> with Cardinal Louis of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, on the latter's mission to <a href="../cathen/10066b.htm">Matthias Corvinus</a>. Upon his return, Raffaelo was persuaded by the Blessed Gaspare da Firenze not to become a Minor Observant, as Raffaelo intended to do; whereupon he married, and established his residence at <a href="../cathen/15504b.htm">Volterra</a>. The remainder of his life was spent in study, in the practice of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and of penance, and in the exercise of <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>; in his own house, he established an <em>accademia</em>, in which he gave lectures on <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and on <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, while he founded the Clarisse <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/15504b.htm">Volterra</a>. He died in the odour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>; and, contrary to his desire, his brother erected to his memory a splendid monument, the work of Fra Angelo da Montorsoli.

<p>Among the works of Maffei are "Commentariorum rerum urbanarum libri XXXVIII" (Rome, 1506; Paris, 1516), all encyclopedia of all subjects known at that time, prepared with great care, but not always with the best judgment. It consists of three parts; in the first, "Geography", he writes extensively of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spaniards</a> and of the Portuguese; the second part, "Anthropology", is devoted, more especially, to the contemporaneous history of that time; the third part is devoted to "Philology". Maffei's lives of <a href="../cathen/14032b.htm">Sixtus IV</a>, <a href="../cathen/08019b.htm">Innocent VIII</a>, <a href="../cathen/01289a.htm">Alexander VI</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12128a.htm">Pius III</a>, which appear as an appendix to the Platina, and which were also published separately (Venice, 1518), are taken from the "Commentarii"; in them Maffei blames unsparingly the disordered life of the Roman court. At <a href="../cathen/15504b.htm">Volterra</a>, he wrote a compendium of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, "De institutione christiana" and "De prima philosophia" (Rome, 1518) in which he rather follows <a href="../cathen/05194a.htm">Scotus</a>. He translated, from the Greek into Latin, the "Odyssey" of Homer, the "Oeconomics" of Xenophon, the "Gothic War" of Procopius, "Sermones et tractatus S. Basilii", some sermons of <a href="../cathen/08459b.htm">St. John of Damascus</a> and of <a href="../cathen/01473b.htm">St. Andrew of Crete</a>; he also wrote the "Vita B. Jacobide Certaldo". On the other hand, he was in epistolary communication with <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a>, and other learned men. The <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> of the work which he called "Peristromata" remained incomplete; it went to the Biblioteca Barberiniana.

<p>The elder brother of Maffei, Antonio, was involved in the conspiracy of the Pazzi. Another brother, Mario, was a man of great culture. He was <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> and, later, prefect of the building of St. Peter's (1507), regent of the penitentiaries, and Bishop, first, of <a href="../cathen/01662b.htm">Aquino</a> (1516) and then of Cavaillon, he died on 23 June, 1537.
