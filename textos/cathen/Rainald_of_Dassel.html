<h1>Rainald of Dassel</h1>  

<p>Born probably not before 1115; died in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, 14 August, 1167. A younger son of a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">rich</a> Saxon count, Rainald I, and destined as such to be an ecclesiastic, he was sent to the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>. At a later date he probably went to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. As early as 1130 he is said to have had a high reputation for classical learning, and to have been a member of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter of <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>. According to documentary evidence he was <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> in 1148, and in 1154 received the provostship of Petersberg at Goslar and of St. Moritz at <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">Hildesheim</a>. Soon after 1154 he was also <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter at Munster but declined the <a href="../cathen/07353a.htm">See of Hildesheim</a>. As a member of the embassy sent by <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Frederick I</a> in 1153 to Eugenius III at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> he first revealed his political ability, and in 1156 the emperor appointed him chancellor of the empire. The Diet of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a> (October, 1157) left no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the drift of his policy. He inaugurated a German policy which insisted upon the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and the power of the German kings, the strengthening of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">German Empire</a>, the lordship of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and the humiliation of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>. Full of life, at times rough and blunt and again careful and calculating, Rainald, who, in spite of his <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to wield the sword, henceforth influenced the policy of his imperial masters. Though he did not wish to separate <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> entirely from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and still held the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> respect for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, his temperament carried <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> much further than the latter desired, or then was advantageous under the circumstances. When Frederick finally submitted, it was Rainald who prevented him from making concessions which might have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> of advantage. The struggle with the <em>curia</em> began at the Diet of <a href="../cathen/02525b.htm">Besan&ccedil;on</a>, where Rainald vigorously rejected the use of the word <em>beneficium</em>, which might mean fief as well as benefit. In the expression used, that the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> would have been glad to grant the emperor even greater <em>beneficia</em> (or benefits), it was thought that the old desire of the <em>curia</em> for the mastery of the world was to be found. In 1158 Rainald undertook a diplomatic journey into <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to prepare the way for the emperor. In 1159 he was appointed <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/04116a.htm">Cologne</a>, and during the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> between <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> and <a href="../cathen/15411a.htm">Victor IV</a> supported the imperial <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In 1160 he was the ambassador of the emperor to the courts of the French and English kings, whom he endeavoured to win to the side of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, but he did not succeed. In 1161 he joined the emperor before <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and influenced him to consent to the destruction of the city. Rainald was also employed in diplomatic negotiations with <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>, <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, and Louis VII; these, however, failed. In 1163 <a href="../cathen/01287a.htm">Alexander III</a> <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> Rainald, who had loudly proclaimed in these negotiations the right of the emperor to dispose of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">papal see</a>. Basing his action on the Roncalian decrees, Rainald was once more successfully employed in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in the affairs of the emperor. When <a href="../cathen/15411a.htm">Victor IV</a> died, Rainald, of his own volition and without waiting for the consent of the emperor, elected at <a href="../cathen/09405a.htm">Lucca</a> a new <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, <a href="../cathen/11515a.htm">Paschal III</a>. Frederick would hardly have continued the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. Rainald <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this and therefore wished to force the emperor to continue the struggle for imperial supremacy. In 1164 he was again in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and brought the bones of the Three Kings with him. In the meantime the number of the adherents of the lawful <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> increased in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. Finally only Rainald supported the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>. Rainald won the consent of the King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> to common ecclesiastico-political action in behalf of Paschal and once more took up arms in defence of his one <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>, which he hoped the proposed <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a> of Chgarlemagne at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a> in 1165 would advance. In 1166 he was again in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, actively engaged in preparing the way for the emperor. While there with a few mounted soldiers he defended himself in Tusculum against a much larger force of Roman troops. His death was <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> by the pest; he was buried in the Lady Chapel of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> at Cologne.
