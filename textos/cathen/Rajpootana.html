<h1>Rajpootana</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">Prefecture Apostolic</a> in <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a>, attached to the Province of <a href="../cathen/01225a.htm">Agra</a>, comprises approximately the collection of Native States which form the Rajpootana Agency. To the north it is bounded by the Bahawalpur State and the Punjab; on the east it extends to Abahari, Pipli, Rania, Sirsa, Hissar, Rewari, the Native States of Alwar, Bharatpur, Dholpur, and as far as Sipri (which however belongs to Agra), then to Lallitpur and Bina; on the south it reaches to the limits of the Bhopal State and the River Nerbudda; on the west to the borders of the Bombay Presidency &mdash; excepting Mount Abu and Abu Road station, which belong to the <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Archdiocese of Bombay</a>.

<p>Out of a total population of 10,800,00 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> number about 3846 (<a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europeans</a> 656, Eurasians 609, natives 2581) who have 9 churches and 8 <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapels</a> served by 29 <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin Fathers</a> of the Province of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, assisted by 10 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a> of the same order.

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Originally a portion of the Vicariate Apostolic of the Great Mogul, and later on of the Thibet-Hindustan mission, Rajpootana had no <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">ecclesiastical history</a> down to the year 1891, when it was separated from the <a href="../cathen/01225a.htm">Archdiocese of Agra</a>, and made into a prefecture apostolic. At this date the district had only one mission station, Jaipur. Besides this, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> was residing at Ajmere in charge of a small community of Eurasians and Goanese, and there were also stations for troops at Nasirabad, Neemuch, and Mhow, served by three military <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplains</a>. Since the coming of the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> other stations have been established at Ratlam, Thandla, Mariapur, Jhabua, Jhalrapatan, Parbatpura, and Bhawanikhera, besides sub-stations visited from time to time. There have been two prefects apostolic:&mdash; Father Bertram, 1892-1902, and Father Fortunatus, present <a href="../cathen/12386a.htm">prefect Apostolic</a> from 1903.
<h2>Institutions</h2>
