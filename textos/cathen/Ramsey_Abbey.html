<h1>Ramsey Abbey</h1>  

<p>Ramsey Abbey, Huntingdonshire, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, was founded by Ailwine (Ethelwine, Egelwine), a Saxon noble, in 969. He was encouraged in the undertaking by St. Oswald of York, who advised him that where men have renounced the world the air becomes salubrious, the fruits of the earth are gathered in abundance, famines and pestilence disappear, the State is duly governed, <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisons</a> are opened, and captives set free, those wrecked at sea are relieved, the sick are healed and the weak find means for their convalescence. The site chosen, Ramsey (Ram+eie, insula arietis), was then the largest and finest of the islands of a great marsh formed by the waters of the Ouse. It was afterwards connected with the mainland by a causeway constructed by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Here Aednoth, nephew of Ailwine, commissioned by Oswald to make preparations, built a wooden church and offices, and as soon as all was ready, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint</a> sent twelve <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> from his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Westbury (Worcester) to take possession. The wooden minster was dedicated by Oswald and <a href="../cathen/05199a.htm">St. Dunstan of Canterbury</a> to St. Mary, all Holy Virgins, and St. Benedict. Soon a fine stone church with towers was erected and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by St. Oswald, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, assisted by Aescwio, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Dorchester, in 991. The year following (992) the two founders, Ailwine and Oswald, died, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, governed till then by <a href="../cathen/12427c.htm">priors</a> (Germanus and Aednoth), was permitted to elect an <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>. Aednoth, son of Aednoth, the prior, was the first to hold office.

<p>Ailwine handsomely endowed his foundation with lands and privileges. He also presented the new church with an <a href="../cathen/01353b.htm">altar-frontal</a> (<em>tabula in fronte eminentioris altaris</em>) of wood, covered with silver plates and many-coloured jewels. King Edgar, Henry I, Henry II, and others extended and confirmed the possessions and liberties. In 1002 the body of <a href="../cathen/08256b.htm">St. Ives (Ivo)</a> was <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a> discovered in the neighbourhood and this led to the establishment of the dependent <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08256b.htm">St. Ives</a>. Another dependent <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priory</a> or cell was Modney, in Norfolk. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> had a seat in Parliament and ranked next after Glastonbury and <a href="../cathen/01252b.htm">St. Alban's</a>. At the Dissolution (1539) John Wardeboys, <em>alias</em> Lawrence, willingly resigned the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> into the king's hands and received a pension of &#163;266. 13s. 4d. per annum. The estates were granted by <a href="../cathen/07222a.htm">Henry VIII</a> to Sir Richard Williams, alias Cromwell. The revenue, according to Dugdale, was &#163;1716. 12s. 4d., but according to Speed, &#163;983. 15s. 3 1/4 d. Nothing important remains of the buildings but a ruined Late Gothic gateway.
