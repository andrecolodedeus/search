<h1>Ranulf Higden</h1>  

<p>(HYDON, HYGDEN, HIKEDEN.)

<p><a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> chronicler; died 1364. He was a west-country man, and was professed a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> at the Abbey of St. Werburg, <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>, in 1299. Beyond this nothing is recorded of his personal life and he is known only by his great work, the "Polychronicon", a universal history down to his own times. As it was the most complete history available during the fourteenth century, it enjoyed great popularity during that and the following age; though even the contemporary portion, in which Higden wrote the history of his own times down to 1342, is of no remarkable value. It was translated into English by John of Trevisa in 1387, and this translation was printed by Caxton in 1482, and by Wynkyn de Worde in 1495. A later translation, made early in the fifteenth century, has been published in the Rolls Series, in nine volumes. The introductions by the editors contain all available information and describe in detail most of the extant <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>, of which more than one hundred are known to exist. It was long believed that Higden, in compiling the "Polychronicon", had used an earlier work, the "Polycratica tempora" of one Roger of <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>, ending in the year 1314, though with a supplement down to 1339, but the editors of the "Polychronicon" have almost conclusively <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that "Roger of <a href="../cathen/03649a.htm">Chester</a>" was in reality Ranulf Higden himself, who was commonly quoted simply as "Cestrensis". The <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of a scribe in substituting Roger for Ranulf easily gave rise to the mistake. The following are works written by or attributed to Higden, still remaining in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a>: "Speculum curatorum", written in 1340 (Balliol); "Ars Componendi Sermones" (Bodleian); "Paedagogicon" (Sion College); "Distinctiones Theologicae" (Lambeth); "Abbreviationes Chronicorum", attributed to John Rochefort. Other treatises are assigned to Higden by Bale, some, like the "Expositio super Job", "In Cantica Canticorum", "Sermones per annum", "Determinationes super Compendio", and "In litteram calendarii", without much probability; others are merely extracts from the "Polychronicon".
