<h1>Raphoe</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">Diocese</a> of Raphoe (Rapotensis)

<p>Comprises the greater part of the Co. Donegal (Gael. <em>Tirconail</em>), in the <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of Armagh. Raphoe (Gaelic, <em>Rathboth</em>, fort of cottages) was the first of St. Columba's <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> foundation to become as <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which he founded there in the sixth century was renovated about the year 700 by <a href="../cathen/01135c.htm">Adamnan</a>, who succeeded him in Raphoe as well as in <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a>. Although <a href="../cathen/01135c.htm">Adamnan</a> died in <a href="../cathen/08090a.htm">Iona</a> (704) he spent the last six years of his life in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, and his mother's kindred were the clan that occupied the Raphoe district. It is suggested that then, but not before, he may have been in episcopal orders with a <em>sedes</em> at Raphoe (Cuimhne Coluimcille, 12). Be that as it may, for <a href="../cathen/01135c.htm">Eunan</a>, <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> as the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Raphoe, and so recorded by early <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> writers and the ancient <a href="../cathen/03158a.htm">calendars</a>, is no other than <a href="../cathen/01135c.htm">Adamnan</a>, whose name has the same pronunciation with <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> speakers. There is no record of a break in the line of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> succession in Raphoe. But from the death of Nial O'Boyle in 1610 to the appointment of James O'Gallagher in 1725, owing to the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was administered by vicars except during the episcopate of John O'Culenen from 1625 to 1661. The sufferings of this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> were characteristic of the times. He was arrested, taken to <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, and twice brought before the viceroy and Privy Council. About 1643 he again fell into the hands of his enemies. Along with some prominent men of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> he was besieged by English soldiers and forced to surrender. Though promised quarter, seventy-two of his followers were put to the sword, and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was given the choice between death by drowning and death at the hands of the military. Electing the latter fate he was stripped naked, and as the crossbows and matchlocks failed to discharge against the kneeling victim, pikemen were advancing to dispatch him, when Colonel Sir James Asken arrived upon the scene and prevented the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, severely rebuking the soldiers. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was then confined for four years in Derry in a dark dungeon where cold, hunger, and thirst were his portion. In the exchange of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prisoners</a> after <a href="../cathen/11253a.htm">Owen Roe O'Neill's</a> victory at Benburg he regained his liberty in 1647. But when the remnant of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> army under <a href="../cathen/16058a.htm">Heber MacMahon</a> was defeated near Letterkenny in 1650, O'Culenan's life was once more in daily peril. He made his way out of the country in 1653, and died at <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, 24 March, 1661. Six bothers, all older than himself, held high offices in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The eldest, Gelasius, a doctor of the Sorbonne and <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Boyle, was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> in <a href="../cathen/05171a.htm">Dublin</a>, tortured, and hanged. The next <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Raphoe, whose appointment comes just a hundred years after that of O'Culenan, had also to fly for his life. In 1734 James O'Gallagher escaped capture by mounting a horse in the dead of night shortly before soldiers came to seize him. He sought refuge on a remote island in an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> lake, and, during a year's concealment there, wrote for publication the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> sermons which he had been accustomed to deliver to his flock, and which, when printed in 1736, became a powerful reminder of the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life throughout the western half of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> at a time of fierce aggression on the Faith. A marked man, he could not show himself again in Raphoe, and he was transferred to Kildare in 1737, where he found it needful to make a secluded spot in the Bog of Allen the centre of his apostolic labours.

<p>Driven out at the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has never since resided at Raphoe. Even before the flight of the earls from Rathmullen (1607), Donald MacCongail, a remarkable <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a>, who was present at the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> in 1563 and at the Ulster provincial Council in 1587, seems to have resided most of his time at Killybeg, on ground now occupied by structures connected with St. Columba's Marine Industrial School. A remnant of the ancient <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral church</a> in Raphoe still shows in the <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> there; but no ruin marks the site of the ancient <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. It is different with the foundations at Gartan, Glencolumbkille and Kilmacrenen, associated with Columba. More striking to the eye are the remains of the remarkable <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbeys</a> founded during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> in the Diocese of Raphoe. The <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercians</a> were at Assaroe, near Ballyshannon, the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> at Rathmullen, the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> in almost every district of Tirconail. The most celebrated of these foundations was the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> at Donnegal, under whose shelter, after it was dismantled, the "Annals of the Kingdoms of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>" were compiled by the Four Masters (1632-1636). After the plantation of Ulster in the seventeenth century not an acre of good land remained in the hands of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in Tirconill. To this day some of its confiscated <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> lands yield an annual income of &#163;9000 sterling to the Trinity College, Dublin.

<p>Dr. Patrick McGettingen (1820-1861) brought the Loreto Sisters to the Diocese of Raphoe (1854); Dr, Daniel McGettingen (1861-1871), afterwards <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primate</a> of all <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, introduced the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a> (1867), and Dr. James McDevitt (1971-1879) established the Raphoe Diocesan Society (1872); the <a href="../cathen/12399b.htm">Presentation Brothers</a> came to Letterkenny in 1894. The year 1901 is an important date in the history of Raphoe; it was then that the ancient <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>-chapter was re-established by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> and St. Columba declared joint patron with <a href="../cathen/01135c.htm">St. Eunan</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> and of the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. In that year also the new <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, with which the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> residence is at Letterkenny, was <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnly</a> dedicated. Cardinal Logue, a native and former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (1879-1897) of Raphoe, presided, and Archbishop Keane of <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>, also a native, preached the dedication sermon. St. Eunan's (Adamnan's) College was begun at Letterkenny on 23 September 1904, the twelfth centenary of <a href="../cathen/01135c.htm">St. Adamnan</a>, and opened in 1906. There are many <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> in Raphoe, the most frequent being Doon Well, Inniskeel, St. Catherine's Well, and Glencolumbkille.
