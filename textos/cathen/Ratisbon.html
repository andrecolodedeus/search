<h1>Ratisbon</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF RATISBON (RATISBONENSIS), also called REGENSBURG.

<p>Suffragan of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich-Freising</a>. It embraces the greater portion of the administrative district of Oberpfalz, and portions of the districts of Upper and Lower <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and Upper Franconia (see <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">GERMANY</a>, map), an area of about 5340 square miles. It is divided into the three episcopal commissariates of Ratisbon, Amberg, and Straubing, and into thirty deaneries. In 1910 it numbered 473 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 167 <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a> (exclusive of 74 united with other <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a>), 80 expositorships, 371 curacies, and 36 other pastoral offices, 1283 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (including 442 <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a> and 159 <a href="../cathen/12722c.htm">regular priests</a>), and over 865,000 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. In addition to the ordinary, there is a coadjutor <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (<a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> 18 April, 1911); the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapter consists of a <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a>, 8 capitulars, 6 <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> vicars, and a <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> preacher. There is also a chapter at the collegiate Church of Our Lady "Zur Alten Kapelle" in Ratisbon, with 11 members, and a chapter in the collegiate Church of Sts. <a href="../cathen/08486b.htm">John the Baptist</a> and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">John the Evangelist</a> at Ratisbon, with 7 members. The <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> institutions include the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> at Ratisbon, with four courses in <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> and one in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and the episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> for boys at Ratisbon, Metten, and Straubing. For <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> studies there exists at Ratisbon a state lyceum, in which 10 religious and a few lay professors lecture.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and monastic institutions are: for the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>, the Abbey of Metten with a gymnasium and episcopal <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for boys (43 fathers, 8 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and 15 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>) and the Priory of Weltenburg (6 fathers, 2 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and 12 <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>); 3 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the Discalced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, with 22 fathers, 3 <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, and 21 brothers; 2 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the Calced <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a>, with 13 fathers, and 11 brothers; 5 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a>, with 21 fathers, and 46 brothers; 1 <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, with 7 fathers and 7 brothers; 2 hospices of the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Minorites</a>, with 4 fathers and 6 brothers; 2 Augustinian <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a>, with 7 fathers, and 6 brothers; 3 <a href="../cathen/12683a.htm">Redemptorist</a> colleges with 27 fathers, and 26 brothers; 4 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the Brothers of Mercy, with 5 fathers and 100 brothers; 1 brotherhood of <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a>, with 30 brothers, in 25 hermitages; 3 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>; 2 of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Sisters; 2 of the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> Sisters; 1 of the <a href="../cathen/15228b.htm">Ursulines</a>; 1 of the Elizabethines; 1 of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a>; 1 of the Ladies of the Good Shepherd; 76 establishments of the Poor School Sisters; 3 of the English Ladies; 23 of the <a href="../cathen/10199a.htm">Sisters of Mercy</a>, in 12 townships; 1 mother-house and 67 branches of the Sisters of the <a href="../cathen/14637b.htm">Third Order</a> of St. Francis of Mallersdorf; 5 establishments of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Sisters from the mother-house at <a href="../cathen/04795a.htm">Dillingen</a>; 1 institute for the <a href="../cathen/05053a.htm">Daughters of the Divine Redeemer</a> from the mother-house at Niederbronn in Alsace; 1 <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite Sisters</a>. The total number of sisters is 2400. The religious and social <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> are highly developed; it will be sufficient to mention here the Confraternity of Perpetual Adoration, the Congregations of Mary for men, boys, and girls, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> associations for workmen, journeymen, and apprentices, the students' associations, the <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a> association, the Volksverein for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Press Association for <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>.

<p>Among the churches of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> may be mentioned: the Gothic <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of St. Peter, begun in 1275, but not completed until the nineteenth century; the old <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, or St. Stephanskirche (end of tenth century); the Churches of <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a> (eleventh century), St. Jakob (twelfth century), the former <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Church of St. Blasius (1273-1400), all at Ratisbon; the churches of Amberg, Straubing, Naabburg; numerous old <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> churches, such as those of Weltenburg, Pr&uuml;fening, Ober-Alteich etc. Much-frequented places of <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimage</a> are: Mariahilf, near Amberg; the Eichelberg, near Hemau; the Kreuzberg, near Schwandorf; and Neukirchen beim hl. Blut.

<p>Ratisbon, the oldest town in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, had its origin in the Roman camp, <em>Castra Regina</em>, the remains of whose walls exist today. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was introduced during the time of the Romans. In the sixth century Ratisbon was the chief town of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, and the seat of the apostolic labours of several holy evangelists, such as <a href="../cathen/13229a.htm">St. Rupert</a> (about 697), <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a> (about 710), St. Erhard (about 720), and <a href="../cathen/01261a.htm">Blessed Albert</a> (about 720). In 739 <a href="../cathen/02656a.htm">St. Boniface</a> divided the Duchy of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> into the four <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> of Ratisbon, <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">Passau</a>, Freising, and Salzburg, and appointed as first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Ratisbon Blessed Gawibald or Gaubald (739-61). The early <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were chosen alternately from the canons of the Church of St. Peter and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> they were simultaneously <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>; after the elevation of <a href="../cathen/13411b.htm">Salzburg</a> to <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> rank by <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Leo III</a>, Ratisbon was placed under it. Through the favour of the native dukes and, after their removal, through that of the Carlovingians and Ottos, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> received much <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and many gifts for their churches. The possessions of the chapter consisted of the three free imperial domains Donaustauf, W&ouml;rth (both on the Danube), and Hohenburg on the River Lautrach, the domain of Pechlarn below the Enns, and the administration of a few places in Lower <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>. During the early period the chief care of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> being for the most part won for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by Ratisbon. Bishop Bahurich (817-48) <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> fourteen <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> princes at Ratisbon in 847, and <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> long belonged to the diocese. Under Ambricho (864-91) Louis the German built the celebrated "Alte Kapelle" in which his spouse Emma and the last <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Carlovingian</a> emperors Arnulf and Louis the Child found their resting-places. During the reign of Blessed Tuto (894-931) the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> suffered much from the inroads of the Hungarians; Bishop Michael (942-72) took personal part in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against these invaders, especially in the battle of Lechfeld. <a href="../cathen/15682b.htm">St. Wolfgang</a> (972-94) agreed to the separation of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> of Ratisbon, and also separated the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> from the Monastery of <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a>.



<p>The era of the following <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is characterized by the foundation of numerous <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. Gebhard I (995-1035) founded the Abbey of Pruhl; his attempt to annul the separation between the diocese and Emmeram gave rise to much dispute; he received from <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> the right of <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coinage</a>. <a href="../cathen/06402a.htm">Gebhard III</a> (1036-60) received from Henry III the Abbey of Kempten; during his episcopate the collegiate chapter of Ohringen and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Geisenfeld were founded. Otto of Ritenberg (1061-89) espoused the cause of the emperor in the <a href="../cathen/08084c.htm">Conflict of Investitures</a>, while <a href="../cathen/15629b.htm">Blessed William</a>, <a href="../cathen/12517a.htm">provost</a> of <a href="../cathen/05405b.htm">St. Emmeram</a> and later <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of the renowned <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Hirsau, the "hero of monasticism and champion of reform", worked in the spirit of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope Gregory</a>. Under Gebhard IV, who received neither <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> ratification nor <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> abbey of Oberalteich was founded; under Hartwich I (1105-26) were founded the Scots <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. James at Ratisbon, and the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Mallersdorf, Pr&uuml;fening, Reichenbach, and Ensdorf; under the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> Konrad I (1126-32), the <a href="../cathen/03780c.htm">Cistercian</a> abbey of Waldsassen, the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Biburg; under Heinrich I (1132-55), the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Windberg and several chapters of <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Augustinian Canons</a>. Konrad III (1186-1204) took part in <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa's</a> <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a>; Konrad IV again confirmed the dominion of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> over the city of Ratisbon, which in the following period gradually acquired independence and developed into a free town of the empire; in 1226 Konrad gave the recently-founded <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan Order</a> a residence and <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> in the city. Under Siegfried the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelites</a> and <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> also established themselves in the diocese. Prominent among the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscans</a> was Blessed Bernhard of Ratisbon, one of the most powerful preachers of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> gave to the diocese the great <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/01264a.htm">Albertus Magnus</a>, on whose <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> retirement Leo Thundorfer (1262-77), who began the building of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, was elected. The building was continued vigorously under Heinrich II of Rotteneck (1277-96), who led a truly holy life and proved himself an excellent spiritual and secular prince. Konrad of Luppurg (1296-1313), Nikolaus of Stachowitz (1313-40), and Konrad VI (1368-81) were also distinguished <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. Albert of Stauf (1409-21), an adherent of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, devoted himself <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> to the reform of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; in 1419, at a <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> synod, he issued an excellent pastoral instruction for his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Albert and his immediate successors &mdash; Johann of Streitberg (1421-28) and Konrad VII of Rehlingen (1428-37), a <a href="../cathen/15601b.htm">Westphalian</a> &mdash; had to take the field against the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a>, who had made several devastating inroads into the territory of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>. Heinrich IV of Absberg (1465-92), an admirable <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, took energetic measures against the <a href="../cathen/07585a.htm">Hussites</a> and other fanatics, against the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a> of the people, and the incontinency of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; to the restoration of discipline and order in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, especially in several <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>, he devoted a restless activity. In the same spirit worked Rupprecht II, Count Palatine of Sponheim (1492-1507), under whom the diocese had to suffer much in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between the Wittelsbachs concerning the succession in Bavaria-Landshut.

<p>The religious innovations of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> were on the whole successfully opposed by Johann III of the Wittelsbach <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, the administrator of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> (1507-38); in 1524 he took part in the assembly of the South-German <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and princes at Ratisbon, which, under the presidency of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">papal legate</a> <a href="../cathen/03223a.htm">Campeggio</a>, decreed the execution of the Edict of Worms and the maintenance of the old religion. Under his weak successor Pankraz von Sinzenhofen (1538-48), however, the new doctrines were allowed to spread, and this <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelate</a> was unable to prevent the town from accepting the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> and demolishing the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. The negotiations at the Diet of Ratisbon in 1541 resulted in the Ratisbon Interim, which went very far towards meeting the wishes of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, but yet did not find approval with the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes. The efforts of the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> Georg Marschalk of Pappenheim (1548-63) and David K&ouml;lderer of Burgstall (1567-79) met with especially obstinate resistance from the city. Under Philipp (1579-98), son of Duke William V of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> and afterwards <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> were assigned a <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> at Ratisbon, with which a gymnasium was combined in 1589. Wolfgang II von Hausen (1600-13) was a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> patron of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> and promoter of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> reform, and joined the Catholic League in 1609. Albert von T&ouml;rring (1613-59), when the Count Palatine Wolfgang Wilhelm <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">became</a> a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> in 1614, brought back under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> a portion of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, especially in the Upper Palatinate; even the town of Eger with its territory was recovered in 1627 for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14648b.htm">Thirty Years' War</a> caused great injury to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a>; Duke Bernhard of Weimar, a partisan of the Swedes, captured the town of Ratisbon and a portion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> territory in 1633, looted the church treasury, exacted from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> large contributions, and held the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in confinement for fourteen months. Franz Wilhelm von Wartenberg (1649-61), who was also <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/11341a.htm">Osnabr&uuml;ck</a>, <a href="../cathen/10323a.htm">Minden</a>, and Verden, sought to supply the growing need for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> by founding a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerical</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> in 1653. With Albert Siegmund (1668-85) began the series of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from the house of Wittelsbach, which for nearly a century occupied the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a>. Albert was simultaneously <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Freising, as was Joseph Klemens (1685-1716), who, as Elector of Cologne (from 1688), espoused the cause of <a href="../cathen/09371a.htm">Louis XIV</a> in the War of the Spanish Succession, and was for this reason, like his brother Elector Max Emmanuel, placed under the imperial ban. Cardinal Johann Theodor (1719-63) occupied, in addition to Ratisbon, the Dioceses of Freising and <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/02473c.htm">benefices</a>. Excellent administrators were the last prince-bishops, Anton Ignaz von Fugger (1769-87), Max Prokop von T&ouml;rring (1787-89), and Joseph Konrad von Schroffenberg (1790-1803). On the secularization of the German Church in 1803 a portion of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was left undisturbed for a time; then <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> named, even during the lifetime of Schroffenberg, as <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of Ratisbon and Prince-Primate of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, Karl Theodor von Dalberg, Elector of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, and assigned him a portion of the earlier <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> territory. It was only on 1805 that Dalberg received the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> consent to the exercise of <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> power (1805-17). Although Dalberg, in his desire to save his precarious sovereignty, accepted <a href="../cathen/06050b.htm">Cardinal Fesch</a>, <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon's</a> uncle, as coadjutor, he was compelled to surrender the secular territory of the Diocese of Ratisbon to <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> in 1810, whereupon its secularization was finally accomplished. With Dalberg's death the short-lived Archdiocese of Ratisbon came to an end.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> Concordat of 1817-18 declared Ratisbon a simple suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> in the newly-created <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">ecclesiastical province</a> of <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich-Freising</a>, and assigned to it its present limits. The first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> was the former coadjutor, Johann Nepomuk von Wolf (1821-29). He was succeeded by the celebrated Michael Sailer (1829-32). <a href="../cathen/15679a.htm">George Michael Wittmann</a>, who was named successor to the latter, died before his <a href="../cathen/12376a.htm">preconization</a> (1833). Franz Xaver von Schw&auml;bl (1833-41), under whom <a href="../cathen/04786b.htm">Diepenbrock</a> (later <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>) worked at Ratisbon, restored the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>. Valentin Riedel (1842-57) founded the boys' <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at Metten and the priests' hermitage, and prepared the way for the reform of <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">church music</a>. Ratisbon now possesses the world-renowned <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the special study of <a href="../cathen/10648a.htm">Church music</a>, founded by <a href="../cathen/16043b.htm">Haberl</a>. Ignatius von Senestr&eacute;y (1858-1906) completed, with the help of King Louis I, the towers of the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, founded the boys' <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a> at Ratisbon and Straubing, reformed the liturgy in accordance with the Roman model, and greatly promoted the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> life of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> by frequent tours of visitation, the establishment of new pastoral offices, the holding of popular missions, and the building of churches and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>. At the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> he belonged to the Commission on Faith, and was one of the most resolute champions of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">infallibility of the pope</a>. In the ecclesiastico-political <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> in <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a>, especially since the appearance of the Old <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> movement and its encouragement by Minister Lutz, von Senestr&eacute;y always fearlessly and unyieldingly contended for the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a> was conferred on him as a mark of distinction by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in 1906. He was succeeded in 1906 by Antonius von Henle, who had occupied the <a href="../cathen/11519a.htm">See of Passau</a> from 1901 to 1906.
