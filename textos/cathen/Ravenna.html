<h1>Ravenna</h1>  

<p>Archdiocese of Ravenna (Ravennatensis)</p>

<p>The city of Ravenna is the capital of a province in Romagna, central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, on the left of the Rivers Montone and Ronco, the confluence of which is at Ravenna, not far from the mouths of the Po. The Corsini Canal, constructed by <a href="../cathen/04030a.htm">Clement XII</a> in 1736, connects the city and the wet dock with Porto Corsini, on the Adriatic Sea, which is now five miles away. Ravenna is situated on a vast alluvial plain, partly marshy. A pine grove that begins at a distance of two miles from the city, and extends as far as <a href="../cathen/03545b.htm">Cervia</a>, was already famous in antiquity, when it extended to the north as far as <a href="../cathen/01661c.htm">Aquileia</a>. This grove was greatly damaged by the winter of 1879-80, and also by a fire in 1905. The vast plains are cultivated by the intensive system; and the silk industry also flourishes there.

<p>In ancient times, and in the early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, Ravenna was on the coast, the sea forming at this place a lagoon that is shown on the maps of the sixteenth century; the city itself was traversed in all directions and surrounded by natural streams and artificial canals, the most important of which was the Augusta; so that Ravenna resembled <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. Until the time of the first emperors, the houses were all built of wood, or on pile foundations. Its geographical position and the prehistoric objects that have been found at the city show Ravenna to be of ancient origin. It increased very much when the Umbrians and the Etruscans took refuge there at the invasion of the Gauls, against whom it allied itself with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, at a date that cannot be established with precision, retaining its own city regulations. After the Social War, it obtained Roman citizenship (88 <font size=-2>B.C.</font>); and having sided with Marius, Sulla deprived it of its autonomy, and annexed it to the province of Cisalpine Gaul. Before crossing the Rubicon, C&aelig;sar stopped there, concealing his designs under the apparent concern that he entertained for the creation of a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of gladiators. <a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> recognized the military importance of the city, protected, as it was, on the land side by water, and he made it the second station of the imperial fleet, the first being Misenum, near <a href="../cathen/12331a.htm">Pozzuoli</a>.

<p>Around the station of the fleet (<em>classis</em>) there soon sprang up a city which took that name, and which consisted of the dockyards and of the houses of employees connected with that place. Classis was surrounded by walls of its own; and thereafter, the <em>Via C&aelig;sarea,</em> which connected it with Ravenna, became flanked with houses on either side, giving rise to the suburb of C&aelig;sarea. <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> built a common wall around Ravenna and Classis. The chief public buildings were outside the Porta Aurea, among them the amphitheatre, the temple of Apollo, a circus, baths, and a manufactory of arms. Scarcely any of the buildings of that age are preserved, and the aqueduct of <a href="../cathen/15015a.htm">Trajan</a> is completely covered by alluvial deposits; the Porta Aurea was torn down in the sixteenth century; and all that remains of the buildings of Classis are the columns of a few <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a>, scattered about in different churches of the city, while some of them were transported to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>; some <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> are preserved in the museum (<a href="../cathen/02107a.htm">Augustus</a> and his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>), or serve to adorn a few churches (San Giovanni in Fonte, San Vitale); there is a <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> pavement which is also of that period. Funereal monuments abound, especially of naval constructors; the most interesting one of them, in the collection of the Museum, is that of the Longidiena <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. Thusnelda, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Arminius, and Marbod, King of the Marcomanni, were confined at Ravenna. In 404 this city became the imperial residence, Honorius preferring it to <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, which was more exposed to the incursions of the barbarians and of Alaric, who was serving in the pay of the empire. At this time Ravenna was adorned with its most famous monuments, secular and sacred, the latter of which have been in great part preserved. Already about 380 Bishop Ursus had dedicated a splendid basilica to the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Our Lord</a> (called <em>Anastasis</em> in the Byzantine period); on its site the present <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> stands, entirely remodelled in the eighteenth century, the only remains of the ancient basilica being a few <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> and <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>, and two sarcophagi, one of which is said to be that of St. Bartianus; there remain only a few fragments of the <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambo</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Angellus (sixteenth century).

<p>No vestige remains of the palaces of Honorius, of <em>Ad Laurentum</em>, and of Galla Placidia (425-50). Of the churches that were erected under Honorius, there remains Santa Agata, a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> of three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>, which in 1893 was restored to its ancient form; it possesses a notable <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambo</a>, and ancient columns. San Pietro in Classis was torn down in the sixteenth century, to make room for fortifications. Under Galla Placidia there was built the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Giovanni Evangelista, which in the transformations that it underwent in the fourteenth century and in 1747 lost all the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> with which it was adorned, preserving only its columns and its <em>atrium</em>; the Gothic portico dates from 1316. Of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Santa Croce only one half remains. In the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Giovanni Battista only the columns are ancient. Most important is the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace of San Pietro Crisologo, square in shape, and possessing <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>, of which the beardless Christ in the centre is notable. The mausoleum of Galla Placidia, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> dei Santi Nazario e Celso (440), contains the best <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of Ravenna. It is built in the shape of a Latin cross, and has a <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> that is entirely in <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>, representing eight Apostles and symbolical figures of doves drinking from a vessel; the other four apostles are represented on the vaults of the transverse arm; over the door is a representation of Christ as the Good Shepherd, young, beardless, with flowing hair, and surrounded by sheep; opposite, there is a subject that is interpreted as representing <a href="../cathen/09090a.htm">St. Lawrence</a>. There are three sarcophagi, but it is not known whose they were; the largest is said to have been that of Galla Placidia, and that her body was deposited there in a sitting position, clothed with the imperial mantle; in 1577, however, the contents of the sarcophagus were accidentally burned.



<p>Of the same period is San Giovanni in Fonte, which was the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, dedicated by Archbishop Neon (449-52). It is believed that the church was built over the <em>caledarium</em> of a bath on the same site. It is of octagonal shape, with the interior walls and vault adorned with <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>. In the centre of the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a> is the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, on a golden field, with a personification of the <a href="../cathen/08501a.htm">River Jordan</a>; around are grouped the twelve Apostles on a blue field; and below are other figures, possibly of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; there are also arabesques, etc. The marbles of the socle seem to have been taken from secular buildings. The art of this period has the merits of ancient art applied to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> subjects, although its technic already begins to show decadence; for the rest it is still Roman, showing no traces of Oriental influence. The same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the artistic period inaugurated by <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>, King of the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a>. After the battle of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>, Odoacer withdrew to Ravenna, where he withstood a siege of three years by <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>. The taking of <a href="../cathen/13057c.htm">Rimini</a>, however, deprived Ravenna of supplies, and thereby compelled the latter city to capitulate. Archbishop Joannes served as the peace mediator (493). <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> employed Roman architects for the building of profane as well as sacred structures. It has been suggested that in his buildings a Germanic influence may be perceived; but this is without foundation, for even in the Gothic period Ravenna preserved its western Roman character. Nothing remains of the palace that <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> built near San Apollinare Nuovo; what is called Palazzo di Teodorico today was an annex of the former, probably a barrack, and received its present form in the eighth century. Excavations are being made there at the present time.

<p>The palace itself was sacked by the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a> in 539, and thereafter it became the seat of the exarchs, and of the King of the Lombards. Charles the Great took away the columns of this palace to embellish with them his own palace at <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>. The last tower that remained of the palace of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> was destroyed in 1295. <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> also built the Basilica Herculis, baths, and several churches for the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, e.g. San Martino, which is now called San Apollinare Nuovo, because the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of San Apollinaris were transferred to that church in the ninth century. This church was near the palace of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>, and was the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. Its <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> and atrium underwent modernization at various times, but the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the lateral walls, twenty-four columns, and an <a href="../cathen/01381e.htm">ambo</a> are preserved. The <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the right side represent a scheme of twenty-six <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> going to receive their crowns, towards a group representing Christ, beardless, <a href="../cathen/05479c.htm">enthroned</a> amid four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; which latter group is the best. This picture contains a schematic representation of the palace of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>. After the Gothic government had passed away, this composition was somewhat transformed, as is shown by some hands that remain near a column. On the left are the virgins moving from the city of Classis towards the group of the Madonna with the Bambino on her lap, and surrounded by four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; on the two sides are the lines of windows, between which are <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> representing sixteen <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> (<a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctors of the Church</a>?) that have much more individuality than the figures already mentioned. On the third story are represented twenty-six scenes of the life and passion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in which latter, however, the crucifixion is lacking; between each two scenes there is the image of a saint. In another part of the church there is a rough <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> containing the portrait of the Emperor Justinian.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02081a.htm">Church</a> of Santo Spirito (formerly San Teodoro) was the private church of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; near it is Santa Maria Cosmedin, the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of which correspond to those of San Giovanni in Fonte; this <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> also is an octagonal structure with a <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">Church</a> of Sant' Andrea, which was built by <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>, was destroyed by the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> in 1447. After the Byzantine conquest the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> churches were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by Archbishop Agnellus for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship. The mausoleum of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>, a decagonal structure, covered with a great monolith thirty-six feet in diameter, is the monument that reveals Roman art in its purest form, at once austere and graceful. In the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the sarcophagus that was used as a church (Santa Maria della Rotonda) was removed, and there appeared in its place a <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. To <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric's</a> patronage of the arts was due also the Churches of San Vitale, built by Archbishop Ecclesius (526-34), and San Apollinare in Classe, built by Archbishop Ursicinus (535-39); San Vitale, which is a work of the architect Julianus Argentarius, is an octagonal structure of nearly 114 feet in diameter, with an <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> for the altar and presbytery. In 1898 it was restored to its original shape, there being preserved however only the frescoes of the <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a>, which are by <a href="../cathen/15428a.htm">Barozzi</a> and others; between the eight columns that surround the central space there open eight niches of two stories, the upper one of which was a tribune for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> (<em>matron&aelig;um</em>). The columns, which are placed by pairs between the single pilasters, above and below, are embellished with exquisitely beautiful capitals. The <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> and the lateral walls are better than those of the epoch of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a>, although not equal to those of the period of the empire. In the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> is represented a juvenile Christ, seated upon the orb, and surrounded by two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, <a href="../cathen/15486a.htm">St. Vitalis</a> and the Archbishop Ecclesius; below to the right is represented the Empress Theodora with her suite, and to the left Justinian and his suite, there being in the latter the Archbishop Maximianus, in whose time (546-56) the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> were executed.

<p>Other representations are of Abraham extending hospitality to the three <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; the sacrifice of Isaac; the sacrifice of Abel; the Eucharistic Sacrifice (table with <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>), and the sacrifice of Melchisedec (these have a dogmatic value); there are also representatives of Moses, of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, of the Apostles, and of other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Among the ancient sarcophagi, a notable one is that of the Exarch Isaac (641), in the Sancta Sanctorum, which must be a work of the fifth century, with representations of Daniel, of the adoration of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, and of the resurrection of Lazarus. San Vitale was the model of the palatine <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of Charles the Great of <a href="../cathen/01001a.htm">Aachen</a>. San Apollinare in Classe is a work of that same Julianus. This church, which is a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> of three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>, divided by two lines of marble columns, has preserved its ancient structure better. The marble incrustations of the walls were removed in 1449 by <a href="../cathen/09566a.htm">Sigismondo Malatesta</a>. In the lateral <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a> there are the sarcophagi of eight <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, nearly all of them with metrical inscriptions. The <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> have been restored; they represent, around a cross on a blue background, the Transfiguration, the preaching of St. Apollinaris, the sacrifice of Abel; Abraham, Melchisedec, the Emperors Constantine IV, Heracleus, and Tiberius granting privileges to the Archbishop Reparatus (671-77), and four are the portraits of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. <a href="../cathen/09157b.htm">Pope Leo III</a> restored the church, to which later there was annexed a <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>.

<p>Ravenna is today substantially as it was at the beginning of the Byzantine period: subsequent ages have done nothing except to pass by, transforming, not always happily, the work of the fifth and sixth centuries. In 539 the city fell into the hands of Belisarius, who, pretending to accept the crown of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> offered to him by Vittiges, was allowed to enter the town; but when the <a href="../cathen/11347d.htm">Goths</a> attempted to retake it (548-550), it was held against them. At the close of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, Ravenna became the seat of the Byzantine governor, and accordingly was better able than <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to preserve its outward splendour. The Lombards attempted several times to take possession of the city; in 597 Faroald, Duke of <a href="../cathen/14232b.htm">Spoleto</a>, succeeded in taking Classe, but was driven from it two years later by the German Droctulf; the same occurred to Ariulfo in 592, and in 716 to Faroald II, the latter of whom was compelled to restore Classe by Liutprand, who in turn took possession of it 726. Liutprand succeeded in taking Ravenna itself in 731, not, however, without the assistance of a party in the town that was averse to Byzantine domination. This aversion had already manifested itself in 692, when Constans II wished to take <a href="../cathen/13728b.htm">Pope Sergius</a> to Constantinople; the militias of Ravenna and the Pentapolis hastened to the assistance of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, which happened again in 705 in the case of <a href="../cathen/08423a.htm">Pope John VI</a>. When, by order of Leo the Isaurian the Exarch Paulus wished to destroy the sacred images about the year 727, Ravenna revolted, and in the fighting that followed the Exarch himself was killed. Agnello tells of a battle between the Ravennese and the Greeks at a time that is not well defined.

<p>In 752 <a href="../cathen/01237d.htm">Aistulf</a>, King of the Lombards, took Ravenna; then, however, <a href="../cathen/14288c.htm">Pope Stephen II (III)</a> obtained the intervention of Pepin, and the exarchate was united to the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">dominions of the Holy See</a>. Thereafter Ravenna and the exarchate were governed in the name of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, assisted by three tribunes who were elected by the people. Soon, however, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> came to consider themselves feudatories of the empire; and in fact in the confirmation of their temporal power by Henry II and <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a> no mention is made of the sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of Ravenna were the most faithful supporters of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and policy of the emperors in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, while the emperors on different occasions held their courts at Ravenna. In 1198, however, that city &#151; where the communal institutions had been greatly developed &#151; placed itself at the head of the league of the cities of Romagna and of the Marches against the imperial power; and consequently <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> was able easily to enforce the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> over Ravenna, which were ratified by <a href="../cathen/11357a.htm">Otto IV</a> and <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a> at periods when those princes needed the good will of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of 1218 the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Guelph</a> Pietro Traversari, having vanquished the faction of the Ubertini and Mainardi, declared himself Lord of Ravenna, and was succeeded by his son Paolo in 1226. Paolo fought against <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, who in 1240 took the office of <em>podest&aacute;</em> from Paolo's son, also named Paolo. In 1248, however, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> took Ravenna, and the Traversari returned to power; but in 1275 they were driven from the city by Guido Novello da Polenta, who was made perpetual captain.

<p>His son Lamberto (1297-1316) abolished the democratic government, and having died without children was succeeded by his cousin Ostasio I and Guido Novello, of whom the latter was a lover of letters and of the arts; he received <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> with honours, and called to Ravenna <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a>, who <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painted</a> the vault of San Giovanni Evangelista with frescos, while other artists who studied under him adorned with frescos Santa Maria in parta fuori (supposed portraits of Guido da Polenta, <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a>, Chiara, and Francesco da Polenta), and Santa Chiara, founded by Chiara da Polenta in the thirteenth century. <a href="../cathen/04628a.htm">Dante</a> died at Ravenna (1321) and was buried in the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibule</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Francesco. His present mausoleum was erected in 1482 by Bernardo Bembo. Ostasio received from Louis the Brave and from <a href="../cathen/02430a.htm">Pope Benedict XII</a> the title of vicar. Not less cruel than Ostasio was his son Bernardino (1345-59), against whom his own brothers conspired; they died, however, in the same <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of <a href="../cathen/03545b.htm">Cervia</a> into which he had been treacherously thrown. A better ruler was Guido Lucio, who in his old age in 1389 was thrown into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> by his sons, where he ended his days. He was survived by his son Ostasio IV, who died in 1431. Ostasio V in 1438 was forced into an alliance with Duke Filippo Maria of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> by that prince, on which account the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> invited him to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, where he soon learned that the annexation to <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> had been proclaimed at Ravenna. He died in a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a>, the victim of a mysterious assassination. The <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> governed Ravenna by <em>provveditori</em> and <em>podest&aacute;</em>. In 1509 <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> attempted to retake all of Romagna that was held by the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>, and sent the Duke of <a href="../cathen/15221b.htm">Urbino</a> with an expedition. Ravenna was defended by the <em>podest&aacute;</em> Marcello and by the captain Zeno; but at the news of the defeat of Agnadello, the republic ordered the restoration of Ravenna to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.

<p>Three years later, in 1512, there took place near this city the disastrous battle in which the French defeated the allied Pontifical and Spanish troops. In 1527, notwithstanding their alliance with <a href="../cathen/04024a.htm">Clement VII</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> occupied Ravenna and the Romagna, which, however, they were compelled to restore in 1529. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> governed Ravenna through a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>. Of this period are: the monument of the battle of 1512, erected in 1557; the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of Guidarello Guidarelli, and Tullio Lombardo, in the Museo Nazionale; those of Luffio Numai and Tommaso Flamberti, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Francesco (1509), and, above all, the church and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> in Portu (1553), built on the site, and in part with the materials, of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of San Lorenzo in C&aelig;sarea (fifth century); it has a Byzantine Madonna of the tenth century. Its construction was undertaken when the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Regular Canons</a> of Portu were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to leave Santa Maria in portu fuori; the church has three <a href="../cathen/10724a.htm">naves</a>, and an octagonal <a href="../cathen/04569d.htm">cupola</a>; the stalls of the choir are adorned with beautiful carvings, and the <em>loggia</em> of the garden of the annexed <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is of very pure style. The <a href="../cathen/05745c.htm">fa&ccedil;ade</a> dates from 1784. The city was adorned with princely palaces, more especially the work of the architects Danisi, Grossi, Morigia, and Zamaglini, while Nicol&oacute; Rondinelli, at <a href="../cathen/13463a.htm">Santo Domingo</a>, Cotignola, Luca Lunghi and his sons, <a href="../cathen/12771a.htm">Guido Reni</a>, at the Duomo, and other <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> adorned the churches. Meanwhile, the public works were not neglected. Besides the fortifications already constructed by the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>, which were enlarged, there was dug in 1654 the Canale Panfilio (named in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a>), by the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> Donghi, and, in the following century, the Canale Corsini, works that were <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> not only to facilitate maritime commerce but to preserve the city from inundation in consequence of the raising of the beds of the rivers. In 1797 Ravenna became a part of the Cispadan Republic, and later of the Cisalpine Republic. The Austrians took it from the French, who in turn drove the former from the city in 1800-01. The town was incorporated into the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a>, after which it was attacked again by the Austrians, and finally was restored to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Provisional governments were established in 1831, 1849, and 1859; and in 1860 the annexation of Ravenna to the <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Kingdom of Italy</a> was declared.

<p>The academy of <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">fine arts</a> has some <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> by well-known masters, mentioned above: San Romualdo, by Guercino; a collection of Byzantine and of <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slav</a> Madonnas, and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a> by <a href="../cathen/03298b.htm">Canova</a> and Thorwaldsen. The Museo Nazionale contains collections of Etruscan, Greek, Roman, and Byzantine <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> and inscriptions, and also <a href="../cathen/11152a.htm">coins</a> and inscriptions of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>; fragments of ancient <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptures</a>, and a bust of <a href="../cathen/08020b.htm">Innocent X</a> by <a href="../cathen/02510b.htm">Bernini</a>. It occupies the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> of Classe, who moved into the city in 1515. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archiepiscopal</a> palace also has a lapidary hall, ancient vestments, a <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">Lenten</a> calendar for the years 532 to 626, and a chiselled <a href="../cathen/08257b.htm">ivory</a> throne of the sixth century, taken to Ravenna in 1001 by Ottone III, who received it from Pietro Orseolo, Doge of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>.

<p>According to local tradition, St. Peter himself founded the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Ravenna, and established as its first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> St. Apollinaris, a native of Antioch, who according to the same tradition suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> under <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>; the acts of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, however, have scarcely any historical value; they were probably written under the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Maruo (642-61), and intended, together with the alleged Apostolic origin of the See of Ravenna, to abet the autocratic aspirations of that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. However, in 1756 there was discovered near Classe a <a href="../cathen/03510a.htm">Christian cemetery</a> in which there were found inscriptions that date from the second century; and in 1904 in Classe itself there was unearthed another graveyard, the upper layers of which date from the fifth century. It may be concluded, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was taken to Ravenna by sea. It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that St. Apollinaris was the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and that he suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. According to the list of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Ravenna, handed down to our times by Agnellus (ninth century), who received it from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Marianus (546-56), of whose accuracy there is no reason to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, Severus was the twelfth of the series; and as he is among those who signed at the <a href="../cathen/13473a.htm">Council of Sardica</a> (343), the epoch of St. Apollinaris may be established as belonging to the beginning of the third century, or possibly to the last decades of the second century, when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, under <a href="../cathen/04166a.htm">Commodus</a>, enjoyed a measure of peace that was propitious to the development of hierarchical organization. Ravenna accordingly became a centre of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianization</a> for Emilia. The only <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> among its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was St. Apollinaris, whose <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> occurred, possibly, under Septimus Severus.

<p>Other <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were St. Ursicinus, SS. Fusca and Maura, <a href="../cathen/15486a.htm">St. Vitalis</a> (not the <a href="../cathen/15486a.htm">St. Vitalis</a> of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>), etc. Among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, besides those already named, mention should be made of Joannes Angeloptes (430-33), so called because he had the gift of seeing his <a href="../cathen/07049c.htm">guardian angel</a>; he obtained through Galla Placidia the title and the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> of the fourteen cities of Emilia and Flaminia. The <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, as in the past, continued to be confirmed and to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; St. Peter Chrysologus (433-49), formerly <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">Deacon</a> of <a href="../cathen/07692a.htm">Imola</a>, was so confirmed and <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. For the rest, the presence of the imperial court, and later, of that of the <a href="../cathen/05676b.htm">exarch</a>, aroused in the minds of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> a great sense of their dignity and a certain spirit of independence in regard to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; while the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> on the other hand were disposed to cede no measure of their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, as was shown in the case of Simplicius, who threatened Joannes III with the forfeiture of the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrate</a> his suffragans; in the case of <a href="../cathen/06031a.htm">Felix IV</a>, in regard to the questions that arose between Bishop Ecclesius (521-34) and his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; and in the case of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">St. Gregory the Great</a>, who was compelled to repress the excess of pomp of Archbishop Joannes V (575-595) and that of his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and who, on account of those conditions, at the death of Joannes, caused the election of Mariniano (606), who had been a companion of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Sant' Andrea. The better to insure the subordination of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a>, the latter were forced to sign at the time of their <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> a declaration to that end (<em>indicula et cautiones</em>), in which were written the chief <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of those <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>. In connexion with this declaration, there arose differences of interpretation between Pope Vitalianus and Archbishop Maurus (648-71), which led to the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, Maurus having sought and obtained the privilege of autonomy from the Emperor Constans II, who was a <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite</a>, and therefore ready to humiliate the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; even on his deathbed, Maurus exhorted his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> not to subject themselves to the yoke of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; and accordingly Reparatus (671-77) did not go to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> for his <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a>.

<p>It is uncertain whether Reparatus or Theodorus (677-88), who also was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by his suffragans, re-established the union with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Theodorus adhered to the Roman Council of Agatho (680); for the rest, he was <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> for having suppressed many abuses among them. There followed St. Damianus (688-705); St. Felix (705-23), who at first also had aspirations to independence; but when Justinian II, having recovered the throne, sent a fleet to punish Ravenna for its complicity in his dethronement, as he believed, the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> was taken to Constantinople, blinded, and sent to <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, whence he was recalled by Philippicus Bardanes (712). Of the constancy of Ravenna against <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasm</a>, mention has already been made above. Sergius (748-69) also had differences with the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>. Georgius (835-46) went to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in search of a grant of autonomy, but was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> by the troops of Charles and Louis II, at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> at that time with Lothair (835), and with difficulty was able to return to his country. Matters again became acute under Archbishop Joannes X (850-78), who, moreover, had displeased the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people of his own see and his suffragan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by his overbearing acts, consecrating <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> against the pleasure of the people and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, imposing heavy expenses upon his suffragans in the visits that he made every other year, preventing his suffragans from communicating directly with <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, etc. Accordingly, he was cited to appear at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas I</a>; but Joannes having refused to obey the summons, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> went in person to Ravenna, where he became convinced of the general aversion to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>, who, being then deprived of the protection of the emperor, was compelled to appear before the council (861), which reprimanded him. Later, however, he again intrigued against <a href="../cathen/11054a.htm">Nicholas</a>, with the Bishops of <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> and Cologne. He was the founder of the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Isola Palazziola.

<p>Romanus (878-88) also was disaffected to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; Joannes XII (905) became <a href="../cathen/08425b.htm">Pope John X</a>. Petrus VI (927-71) was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to protect the <a href="../cathen/12466a.htm">property of the Church</a> in two <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>; Gerbertus (998-99) became Pope Sylvester II; under Leo II (999-1001) the Ravennese grammarian Vilgardus was condemned for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; Arnoldus (1014-19) was a brother of <a href="../cathen/07227a.htm">St. Henry II</a>, who gave to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> temporal sovereignty over Ravenna, Bologna, <a href="../cathen/07692a.htm">Imola</a>, <a href="../cathen/05751b.htm">Faenza</a>, and Cervia, without mentioning the sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; of Archbishop Bebhardus (1027-44), <a href="../cathen/11764a.htm">St. Peter Damian</a> says that he maintained himself unsullied in the general corruption of that day; Hunfredus (1046-1051) had been chancellor of Henry III; under him there arose the question of precedence between the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a> and Ravenna at the imperial court, which gave room to an altercation between the suites of those <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> at the <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">coronation</a> of Henry III. Hunfredus, like his successor, Enrico (1052-71), who had been vice-chancellor of Henry III, was of the imperial party, and opposed to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>; Enrico favoured the cause of the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> <a href="../cathen/03128c.htm">Cadalous</a>. <a href="../cathen/07063a.htm">Guibertus</a>, who was chancellor of Henry IV, caused himself to be elected <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a>, in opposition to <a href="../cathen/06791c.htm">Gregory VII</a> (1080), by whom he had been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> since 1076. At the beginning of the twelfth century the blessed Petrus Onesti founded the Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/03288a.htm">Regular Canons</a> of <a href="../cathen/13458a.htm">Santa Maria</a> in Portu. Anselmus (1155-58), formerly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Havelberg, is famous for his legations to Constantinople, and for his polemical works against the Greeks. Guido da Biandrate (1158-69) favoured the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of <a href="../cathen/06252b.htm">Barbarossa</a>, who was his protector. In the time of Gherardo (1170-90), there arose the question between the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Classe and those of San Martino in regard to the body of St. Apollinaris, which, the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of San Martino claimed, had been transferred to their church for its safety against the incursions of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>.

<p>Filippo Fontana (1251-70) preached the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against Enzelino. After his death the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> remained <a href="../cathen/15248b.htm">vacant</a> for four years, until <a href="../cathen/06798a.htm">Gregory X</a> appointed to it Bonifacio Fieschi (1274-94). St. Rinaldo Concoreggi (1303-21) restored <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, and held six <a href="../cathen/12515a.htm">provincial synods</a>. Rinaldo da Polenta was killed by his own brother, Ostasio (1322), who then usurped the Lordship of Ravenna. Fortuniero Vaselli (1342-1347) made a <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusade</a> against the Ordelaffi of <a href="../cathen/06137a.htm">Forli</a> and the Manfredi of <a href="../cathen/05751b.htm">Faenza</a>, and concluded a peace between <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and <a href="../cathen/06419a.htm">Genoa</a>. Pileo de Prata (1370-87), a man of stern doctrines, was made a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a> by <a href="../cathen/15216a.htm">Urban VI</a>, and sent as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and <a href="../cathen/07547a.htm">Hungary</a>, which countries he held in obedience to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>. Cosmo Migliorati (1387) became in 1400 <a href="../cathen/08019a.htm">Pope Innocent VII</a>, and named as his successor at Ravenna his nephew, Giovanni Migliorati (1400-10), whom he made a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>. Roverella (1445-76), later a <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, was a man of great learning, who was sent on various occasions as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and elsewhere. Pietro Accolti (1524-32) had been professor of canon law at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a>, and secretary to <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a>. Benedetto Accolti (1532-49), a famous man of letters and historian, was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> under <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Paul III</a> for unknown reasons. An awakening of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life, such as had taken place on former occasions in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, was effected at the time at Ravenna. The <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Gerolamo Maluselli established the congregation of <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a> of the Buon Ges&uacute; (1531); while there appeared a lay oratory, and the Blessed <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentile</a>, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, and Margherita de' Molli shone for their virtues. Cardinal Guilio della Rovere (1565-78) acquired great merit by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms he effected; he held many provincial and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocesan</a> <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a>, and built the <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a>.
