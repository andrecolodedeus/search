<h1>Raymond Lully</h1>  

<p>(RAMON LULL)

<p>"Doctor Illuminatus", <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, poet, and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a>, b. at Palma in Majorca, between 1232 and 1236; d. at <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a>, 29 June, 1315. Probably a courtier at the court of King James of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a> until thirty years of age, he then became a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> and afterwards a tertiary of the Order of St. Francis. From that time he seemed to be inspired with extraordinary <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedan</a> world. To this end he advocated the study of Oriental languages and the refutation of <a href="../cathen/01663a.htm">Arabian</a> philosophy, especially that of <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroes</a>. He founded a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for the members of his community in Majorca, where special attention was given to Arabic and Chaldean. Later he taught in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. About 1291 he went to <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a>, preached to the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>, disputed with them in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and after another brief sojourn in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, returned to the East as a missionary. After undergoing many hardships and privations he returned to <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in 1311 for the purpose of laying before the Council of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> his plans for the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>. Again in 1315 he set out for <a href="../cathen/15088a.htm">Tunis</a>, where he was stoned to death by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a>.

<p>Raymond's literary activity was inspired by the same purpose as his missionary and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educational</a> efforts. In the numerous writings (about 300) which came from his facile pen, in Catalonian as well as in Latin, he strove to show the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/02150c.htm">Averroism</a> and to expound <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> in such a manner that the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> themselves could not fail to see the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. With the same purpose in view, he invented a mechanical contrivance, a <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> machine, in which the subjects and predicates of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> propositions were arranged in circles, squares, triangles, and other geometrical figures, so that by moving a lever, turning a crank, or causing a wheel to revolve, the propositions would arrange themselves in the affirmative or negative and thus prove themselves to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. This device he called the <em>Ars Generalis Ultima</em> or the <em>Ars Magna</em>, and to the description and explanation of it he devoted his most important works. Underlying this scheme was a theoretical philosophy, or rather a <a href="../cathen/14626a.htm">theosophy</a>, for the essential element in Raymond's method was the identification of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a> with philosophy. The scholastics of the thirteenth century maintained that, while the two <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> agree, so that what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, or vice versa, they are, nevertheless, two distinct <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a>, differing especially in that <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> makes use of revelation as a source, while philosophy relies on reason alone.

<p>The Arabians had completely separated them by maintaining the twofold standard of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, according to which what is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Raymond, carried on by his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the refutation of the Arabians, went to the opposite extreme. He held that there is no distinction between philosophy and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, between reason and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that even the highest mysteries may be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by means of <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> demonstration and the us of the <em>Ars Magna</em>. This of course removed all distinction between natural and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Unlike <a href="../cathen/01036b.htm">Abelard's</a>, however, Raymond's <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a> was of the mystic type: he taught expressly that, for the understanding of the highest <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a>, reason must be aided by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; that once <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has flooded the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with its radiance, reason, enlightened and strengthened by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, "is as capable of showing that there are three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as it is of proving that there cannot be three <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Gods</a>". "Relying on the grace of God", he writes, "I intend to prove the <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> by convincing reasons" ("Opera", Strasburg ed., p. 966). On the other hand, he held that, although reason needs the Divine assistance, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is just as much in need of reason; <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may deceive us unless reason guides it. He who relies on <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone is like a blind man who, relying on the sense of touch, can sometimes find what he wants but often misses it; to be certain of finding his object he needs sight as well as touch. So Raymond held that a man, in order to find out the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, must bring reason to the task as well as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.

<p>These principles were taken up by the followers of Raymond, known as Lullists, who for a time had so great an influence, especially in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, that they succeeded in founding chairs at the Universities of Barcelona and Valencia for the propagation of the doctrines of the "Illuminated Doctor". The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> authorities, however, recognized the dangerous consequences which follow from the breaking down of the distinction between natural and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Consequently, in spite of his praiseworthy <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and his crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, Raymond has not been <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a>. His <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> was formally condemned by <a href="../cathen/06799a.htm">Gregory XI</a> in 1376 and the condemnation was renewed by <a href="../cathen/11581a.htm">Paul IV</a>. Raymond's works were published in ten folio volumes at <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>, 1721-1742. There are, besides, several editions of portions of his writings. His poems and popular treatises, written in Catalonian, had a very wide circulation, in his own day, and their style has won him a high place in the history of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Spanish literature. The best <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> edition of the works in which he describes his <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> machine is the Strasburg edition of 1651. The "Rivista Lulliana", a periodical devoted to the exposition of Raymond's philosophy, was started at Barcelona in 1901.
