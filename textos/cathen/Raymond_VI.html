<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Raymond VI</h1>  

<p>Count of <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, b. 1156; d. 1222; succeeded his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>, Raymond V, in 1195. He was a debauched and sceptical prince, who successively put away three wives, taking as his fourth Jeanne, sister of <a href="../cathen/13041b.htm">Richard Coeur de Lion</a>. Loaded with all the benefits of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he showed the greatest benevolence to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/03435a.htm">Cathares</a> or <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>, whom his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a> had <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, refused to molest them, even allowing them to preach before him, and perhaps allied himself with their <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>. His court was dissolute, and he took no notice of the reproof of the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, <a href="../cathen/12079d.htm">Pierre de Castelnau</a>, who finally <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him in 1207. But shortly after, an equerry of the count having treasonably killed <a href="../cathen/12079d.htm">de Castelnau</a>, Raymond was immediately deposed by the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>. Raymond, frightened into submission, expelled the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> from his dominions, and on 18 June, 1209, in the presence of the pontifical <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a>, did public penance before the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of St-Gilles. When the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">crusaders</a>, assembled in the north of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, invaded Languedoc, Raymond took part in the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusade</a> and assisted at the sieges of Beziers and Carcassone in 1209. Returning to <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a>, Raymond tried to elude his <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> and was <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the <a href="../cathen/02159a.htm">Council of Avignon</a>. He then went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to clear himself of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of <a href="../cathen/12079d.htm">de Castelnau</a>, and was received by <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a>, but on his return found his estates entirely overrun by Simon de Montfort. In 1212 he held only <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and <a href="../cathen/10524a.htm">Montauban</a>. His brother-in-law, Peter, King of <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, came to his rescue, but was killed at the battle of Murat in 1213. In 1215 Simon de Montfort besieged <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> and Narbonne. Instead of organizing resistance, Raymond had negotiated with the pontifical <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legates</a>, who made him the most humiliating propositions. Deprived of his estates, he retired to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, later appearing at the Lateran Council (1215), where he sought to interest <a href="../cathen/08013a.htm">Innocent III</a> in his favour. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, however, ceded the estates of Raymond to Simon de Montfort, reserving for his son only the Marquessates of Provence and Beaucaire. An exile in <a href="../cathen/03410b.htm">Aragon</a>, Raymond VI reassembled his troops, and took <a href="../cathen/14795b.htm">Toulouse</a> (7 November, 1217), later defending it successfully against Simon de Montfort, who was killed 25 June, 1218. Before his death Raymond VI had wrested from Amaury de Montfort nearly all the conquests of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">father</a>.
