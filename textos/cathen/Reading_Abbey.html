<h1>Reading Abbey</h1>  

<p>Reading Abbey in Surrey, <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, was founded by Henry I in 1121, who built it, writes <a href="../cathen/15633d.htm">William of Malmesbury</a>, "between the rivers Kennet and Thames, in a spot calculated for the reception of almost all who might have occasion to travel to the most populous cities of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, where he placed <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> Order, who are to this day a noble pattern of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and an example of unwearied and delightful hospitality". The foundation charter declares that the new <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> takes the place of three others, Reading, Choisey, and Leominster; dedicates it to the Blessed Virgin and <a href="../cathen/08492a.htm">St. John the Evangelist</a>; accords it every civil privilege conceded to royal <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and instructs the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> to employ the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> at his disposal for "the entertainment of the prior, <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a>, and guests". The first <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was Hugues de Boves, late Prior of St. Pancras, Lewes, afterwards <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a>. From the beginning it was an independent <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a>, which, whilst retaining the <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> observance, elected its own <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, paid no impost to the mother-house, was exempt from <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> visitation, and never acknowledged the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the General Chapter or <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of Cluny. Hence, though it has been described as a <a href="../cathen/04073a.htm">Cluniac</a> establishment in ancient documents, even in <a href="../cathen/09202a.htm">papal letters</a> of so late a date as 1309, it was never an "alien" house, and Cluny can only claim the credit of having set it going with <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and monastic customs.

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> precincts covered about thirty acres and were surrounded on three sides by a great wall with four embattled gateways, one of which, the western or compter gate, served as the town <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. It was entered through an inner gatehouse (existing, restored by Sir G. Scott in 1861) wherein the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> held his manorial court. The church, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by St. Thomas &agrave; Becket in 1164, was 450 feet long and 95 feet broad, with <a href="../cathen/15018a.htm">transepts</a> (200 ft.), a Lady-chapel (75 by 50 ft.) built in 1314, and a square central tower with spire. The monastic buildings were on the same scale, and the <a href="../cathen/03584a.htm">chapter-house</a>, an apsidal, vaulted hall (79 by 42 ft.), was frequently used as a national council chamber, where Parliament sat, and many <a href="../cathen/14388a.htm">synods</a> and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> councils were held. There was a leper-hospital, closed in 1413 for lack of inmates. The <em>hospitium</em> had a guest hall (120 ft.), a dormitory (200 ft.) and provision for twenty-six poor pensioners. Part of the building (the dormitory) still exists and for many years was in use as the Royal Grammar School of King Henry VII. The <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was mitred (1288), a <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudal</a> baron, had a seat in Parliament, his own mint, the rectorship of the three Reading <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> and the rents of a number of churches and granges. His chief country-seat was Bere Court, Pangbourne. His officials and servants were some forty, at a time when their number had been cut down for the sake of economy. Three <a href="../cathen/12428b.htm">priories</a> (cells) were under his <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>, Leominster (Herefordshire) in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, Rindelgros, and May in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> (afterwards resigned into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01041c.htm">Aberdeen</a>). At the dissolution the revenues were valued at &#163;2116 3s. 9&#188;d. The last <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> was <a href="../cathen/07518a.htm">Blessed Hugh Cook, <em>alias</em> Faringdon</a>. After serving as a royal palace during some reigns, the buildings were stripped of their carved and dressed stonework for the repairing and building of churches, bridges, and the like, and not much more than the core of some of the walls, huge masses of flint-concrete, is left to preserve the memory of the great <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> which Henry I designed as the monument of his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and where his body and that of his son were buried. The chief spiritual treasures of the <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> were the hand of St. James the Apostle (now in the <a href="../cathen/13322b.htm">sacristy</a> of St. Peter's, Marlow-on-Thames), presented by Henry I, and the skull of St. Philip, given by King John.
