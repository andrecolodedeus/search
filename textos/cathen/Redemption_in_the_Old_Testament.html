<h1>Redemption in the Old Testament</h1>  

<p><em>Redemption</em> means either strictly deliverance by payment of a price or ransom, or simply deliverance by power, as from oppression, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, captivity, etc. In the Hebrew Text, the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> is directly expressed by the verbs <em>ga&rsquo;&aacute;l</em> and <em>padah,</em> and by their derivatives to which the word <em>koph&eacute;r</em> (ransom) is intimately related. Of these two verbs, the former, <em>ga&rsquo;&aacute;l</em>, is used technically in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> by price of an inheritance, or of things vowed, or of <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>; the latter, <em>padah,</em> of redeeming the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of children or of animals. Outside the Law, and in relation to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, both verbs are used of simple <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> or deliverance by power.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, redemption is specifically that of man from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's death</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is distinctly expressed by the verb <em>lutro&#251;mai</em> (from <em>l&uacute;tron,</em> "a ransom") and its derivatives; it is also directly conveyed by the term <em>&rsquo;agor&aacute;zo</em> (to buy, to purchase) and by its compound <em>&rsquo;exagor&aacute;zo</em>. The following is simply a treatment of legal <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Redemption of persons</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> male of every Jewish <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a> and had to be redeemed at the price of five sicles or about $2.75 (<a href="../bible/exo013.htm#vrs2">Exodus 13:2, 13</a>; <a href="../bible/num018.htm#vrs16">Numbers 18:16</a>; etc.). Every other <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelite</a>, whether male or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a>, could be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by a personal <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>, or by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of those to whom he or she belonged. <a href="../cathen/08333b.htm">Jephte's</a> actual immolation of his daughter in consequence of his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> concerning her (<a href="../bible/jdg011.htm#vrs31">Judges 11:31-39</a>), was contrary to the Law. Many <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> carried out their dedication to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, under the form of the <a href="../cathen/10727a.htm">Nazarite</a> <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. Most, however, availed themselves of the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> allowed by the Law. The sum then to be paid as ransom for males between 20 and 60 years of age was 50 sacred sicles; for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a> of a similar age, 30 sicles; for boys between 5 and 20 years old, 20 sicles, and for girls of a corresponding age, 10 sicles; for male children from one month to 5 years of age, 5 sicles, and for those of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">female</a> sex, 3; and finally, for old men over 60 years of age, 15 sicles, and for old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, 10. The poor who could not afford this amount had to pay the price fixed by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, according to their means (<a href="../bible/lev027.htm#vrs2">Leviticus 27:2-8</a>). Persons lying under <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> could not be redeemed.
<h2 id="section2">Redemption of animals</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Mosaic Law</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> male of animals was sacred to the Lord, and, if a <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of legally clean animals, and without blemish, had to be offered in sacrifice. As unclean animals should not be immolated to <a href="../cathen/08329a.htm">Yahweh</a>, their <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> was either to be redeemed according to the valuation of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, with the addition of one-fifth of the value, or to be sold and the price given to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> (<a href="../bible/lev027.htm#vrs27">Leviticus 27:27</a>). The <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of an ass, however, had to be redeemed with a lamb, or, if not redeemed, <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> (<a href="../bible/exo013.htm#vrs13">Exodus 13:13</a>). Outside of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>, any animal could be dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a>. It would be ransomed only if it were legally unfit for sacrifice, in which case the price for its <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> was left to the valuation of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, to which was added one-fifth of the value (<a href="../bible/lev027.htm#vrs11">Leviticus 27:11-13</a>).
<h2 id="section3">Redemption of land, houses, and tithes</h2>

<p>The landed <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> which, in whole or in part, an <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelite</a> was forced by poverty to sell, could be redeemed by his next of kin (the <em>Go&rsquo;el</em>), or by the man himself when again able to do so. The <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> price was then fixed according to the number of years yet to elapse before the Jubilee Year, at which time the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> would have freely reverted to its original owner or to his heir (<a href="../bible/lev025.htm#vrs25">Leviticus 25:25-28</a>). A piece of land dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could also be redeemed. Its value was reckoned according to the amount of seed required to sow it, and a reduction made in proportion to the number of years till the next Jubilee Year. The owner of the land might redeem it at this price, plus one- fifth; and if unredeemed, it went to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> domain at the year of Jubilee. But if the dedicant of the land had himself purchased it from a third <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who had sold it because of his poverty, then at the Jubilee it reverted to the latter, and the dedicant had to recompense the sanctuary by paying its <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> price calculated as before (<a href="../bible/lev027.htm#vrs16">Leviticus 27:16-25</a>). With regard to the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of sold houses, the Law distinguished between dwellings in walled cities and dwellings in unwalled places. For the former houses, the right of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> lasted only a full year from the day of sale, at the end of which they fell forever to their respective purchaser. For the latter, there was no term fixed for their <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>, and if unredeemed before the Jubilee they then freely reverted to their original owners. The houses of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, however, could be redeemed at any time, and reverted to them if unredeemed before the year of Jubilee (<a href="../bible/lev025.htm#vrs29">Leviticus 25:29-34</a>). Houses which had been simply vowed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> could be ransomed upon the payment of the value fixed by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, plus one-fifth of that value (<a href="../bible/lev027.htm#vrs14">Leviticus 27:14, 15</a>). <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">Tithes</a> belonged to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the real owner of the land, and hence could not be made the subject of <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">Tithes</a> of agricultural produce might be commuted for their money value, plus one-fifth; but the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of cattle could not be redeemed (<a href="../bible/lev027.htm#vrs31">Leviticus 27:31-33</a>).
