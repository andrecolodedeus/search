<h1>Redemptorists</h1>  

<p>(CONGREGATION OF THE MOST HOLY REDEEMER)

<p>A <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> founded by <a href="../cathen/01334a.htm">St. Alphonsus Maria Liguori</a>, 9 Nov., 1732, at Scala, near <a href="../cathen/01379a.htm">Amalfi</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, for the purpose of labouring among the neglected country people in the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>.

<p>The Redemptorists are essentially and by their specific vocation a missionary <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. According to their rule they are "to strive to imitate the virtues and examples of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, Our Redeemer, consecrating themselves especially to the preaching of the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the poor". They take the simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty, chastity, and obedience, and by the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty they are bound to refuse all <a href="../cathen/04794a.htm">ecclesiastical dignities</a> outside of the congregation. To these <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> they add the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> and <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of perseverance to live in the congregation until death. Their labours consist principally in missions, retreats, and similar exercises. In order to render these labours most effective, all their sermons and instructions should be solid, simple, and persuasive. On all their missions they are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to preach a sermon on <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and one on the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In order to secure the salutary effects of their missions, they should, after four or five months, return to the places where they have given missions, and preach another, shorter course of sermons. On missions proper the rule <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliges</a> them to hear all the confessions themselves. Wherever the Redemptorists have <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> they labour in the same spirit, both in the <a href="../cathen/12563b.htm">pulpit</a> and in the confessional. One of the great means of preserving truly <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">religious fervour</a> among all classes of the faithful is the Archconfraternity of the Holy Family, which they establish in all their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>. They are also most solicitous in providing well-equipped <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and they take special care of growing youth.

<p>Within ten years of the order's foundation, permanent establishments were made at <a href="../cathen/11086c.htm">Nocera</a>, Ciorani, Iliceto, and Caposele. In 1749 <a href="../cathen/02432a.htm">Benedict XIV</a> canonically approved the work, under the title of the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer. Royalism, however, caused the greatest obstacle to the development of the new congregation. An effort to obtain the royal <a href="../cathen/05707a.htm">exequatur</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> disastrous, and brought about a temporary separation of the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> houses and those which had been founded in the <a href="../cathen/14257a.htm">Papal States</a>. In 1793 a reunion was at last effected under the new superior general, Pietro Paulo Blasucci, who governed the congregation until 1817. In the next six years several houses were opened in different parts of Southern <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> flourished, though subjected to many grave trials. It was destined, however, to take on an international character. In 1785 a young Austrian, <a href="../cathen/04044a.htm">Clemens Maria Hofbauer</a>, journeyed to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with a companion, Thaddeus H&uuml;bl. There they were deeply impressed by the fervour of the Fathers of the church of St. Julian, and applied for admission into the community. After profession and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a>, their chief desire was to transplant the congregation to northern countries. They received permission from the general to establish a house in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> or in any other Austrian city. But the Government was unfriendly, and <a href="../cathen/04044a.htm">Father Hofbauer</a> offered his services to the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Congregation of the Propaganda</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. He was sent to labour for a time in Courland <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>. In 1786, with his former companion, Father H&uuml;bl, he arrived at <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> Saluzzo gave them charge of St. Benno's church, whence they were known in <a href="../cathen/12181a.htm">Poland</a> as "Bennonites". Their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">apostolic zeal</a> and untiring efforts procured the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and effected the <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversion</a> of many <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, while their church presented the spectacle of an uninterrupted mission.

<p>In 1793 Father Blasucci, the <em><a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> major</em>, then residing at <a href="../cathen/11086c.htm">Nocera</a>, appointed <a href="../cathen/04044a.htm">Father Hofbauer</a> his <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> with all <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> authority. His first thoughts turned to <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, though the time seemed inopportune, since <a href="../cathen/06023a.htm">Febronianism</a>, Josephinism, <a href="../cathen/09771a.htm">Freemasonry</a>, and infidelity held sway all over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. He succeeded, however, in establishing three foundations in Southern <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, at Jestetten, Triberg, and Babenhausen, which he confided to the care of his favourite disciple, Father Passerat. These foundations were eventually suppressed, and the members banished. Father Passerat then betook himself to <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, where in 1818 he organized a community at Valsainte in a dilapidated <a href="../cathen/03388a.htm">Carthusian</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. In the meantime, owing to opposition, the house at <a href="../cathen/15555a.htm">Warsaw</a> was suppressed. In 1808 the Fathers were expelled from St. Benno's and deported to the fortress of K&uuml;strin <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, where they were disbanded. <a href="../cathen/04044a.htm">Father Hofbauer</a>, after directing his companions to work for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> whenever and wherever they could, proceeded alone to <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, where he became an assistant <a href="../cathen/03579b.htm">chaplain</a> and confessor of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. His influence was soon felt on all sides, even in the Congress of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> (1815), where the destinies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> were then being shaped. He was styled by <a href="../cathen/12132a.htm">Pius VII</a> the "Apostle of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>". In the meantime he kept up a constant correspondence with his former companions, did all in his power to find for them suitable fields of labour, and predicted that after his death a brighter future was in store for the congregation, a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> that was soon fulfilled. He died 15 March, 1820. In accordance with the request of the Emperor Francis I, the first house of the Redemptorists was canonically established in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas Day</a>, 1820. In May several prominent young men, former disciples of <a href="../cathen/04044a.htm">Father Hofbauer</a>, had already received the religious habit.



<p>Father Passerat succeeded <a href="../cathen/04044a.htm">Hofbauer</a> as <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a>; the onerous and trying <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of his office were rendered more difficult by the prevalent spirit of Josephinism. The years intervening between 1815 and 1821 found some of the Fathers labouring in <a href="../cathen/03046a.htm">Bulgaria</a>, but, owing to the hostility of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatics</a>, they were compelled to abandon this field. A number of flourishing foundations were established between 1820 and 1848. In 1826, at the request of the <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austrian</a> Government, a foundation was started at <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, for the benefit of German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but it did not last long. In 1820 the Redemptorists acquired the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Bischenberg, Alsace. The new community was sent from Valsainte. In 1828 the Fathers exchanged their poorly furnished home at Valsainte for the commodious Convent of Fribourg, which proved to be a fruitful nursery for the congregation until the Revolution of 1848. Prior to 1848 six houses had been established in <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>: Frohnleiten in 1826; Mautern in 1827, the present house of studies; Innsbruck in 1828; Marburg and Eggenburg in 1833; and Leoben in 1834. During Passerat's administration the congregation was introduced into <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> by Father de Held, and in the course of the next ten years four houses were established: Tournai in 1831, St-Trond in 1833, <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a> in 1833, and <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a> in 1849. A foundation was also opened at Wittem, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, where, in 1836, an old <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchin</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> became the house of studies. During the same period another important mission was begun in North America. In 1828 Mgr R&eacute;s&eacute;, <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of <a href="../cathen/03773a.htm">Cincinnati</a>, visited <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> to solicit pecuniary aid and to obtain evangelical labourers. While at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> he applied to Passerat, from whom he secured three <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and three <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>; they arrived in New York 20 June, 1832. Two other Fathers followed in 1835. For seven years they laboured heroically among the whites and the Indians of northern Michigan and northern <a href="../cathen/11225d.htm">Ohio</a>. Though they took charge of many stations in both states, they did not secure a permanent footing in any of these places, with the exception of <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>. In 1839 the Fathers were called to Pittsburg to assume charge of the German congregation, which was then without a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and torn with party strife. In a short time they made it a model congregation. Scattered throughout the surrounding country were many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlers, to whom they preached the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and administered the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. This species of mission inaugurated by them wherever they were established was the beginning of many a well-organized <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of today. From this time the care of German congregations, often in a deplorable condition on account of factions, became a prominent element of the apostolate of the Redemptorists in North America. Their first concern, however, was to establish, wherever feasible, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, which are in a flourishing <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">condition</a> to this day. When the success of the Fathers at <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a> became known, applications were made to them for other foundations. They were called to <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> in 1840; to New York in 1842; to Philadelphia in 1843; to Buffalo in 1845; to Detroit and <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a> in 1847; and to Cumberland in 1849. In 1837 a German congregation had been organized at Rochester by Father Prost, but the Fathers did not take permanent charge until 1841.

<p>Meanwhile the congregation gained a permanent footing in new countries of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. In 1841 King Louis I of <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavaria</a> invited the Fathers to the celebrated shrine of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Our Lady</a> at Alt&ouml;tting. During this period four houses were founded in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>: Landser in Alsace, in 1842; St-Nicolas-du-Port, in 1845; Teterchen in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a> and Contamine in <a href="../cathen/13492a.htm">Savoy</a>, in 1847. The congregation suffered great losses through the revolution that swept over <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in 1848. In 1847 the Fathers were expelled from <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> and in 1848 from <a href="../cathen/02121b.htm">Austria</a>, to which, however, they returned. Important developments were now taking place within the congregation itself. Although the Transalpine portion of the congregation was subject to the <em><a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> major</em> at <a href="../cathen/11086c.htm">Nocera</a> in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, this superior left its government almost exclusively in the hands of a <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> resident at <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>. As the congregation had spread far beyond its original boundaries, it was deemed <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to create the office of provincial between the <em><a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> major</em> and the local superiors. Father Passerat, weighed down by age and infirmities, resigned his office in 1848. After a series of deliberations conducted by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> with the superior general and the Fathers of the Transalpine provinces, Father Rudolph Smetana was appointed <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">vicar-general</a> in 1850. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> was now persuaded that it would be advantageous to have the superior general resident in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Fearing the opposition of the King of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, he did all in his power to convince him of the benefits arising from this step, but in vain; thereupon he decided. that the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, to the exclusion of the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicilian</a> houses, should be placed under a general superior, who was henceforth to reside at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. At the same time he made special regulations for the Redemptorists in the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Kingdom of Naples</a>. On the disappearance of the latter, the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> houses were united to the body of the congregation in 1869.

<p>In pursuance of orders from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, Father Smetana convoked a general chapter. It was opened 26 April, 1855. The result of this chapter was the election of Father Nicholas Mauron, a native of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, as superior general. He was the first <em><a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> major</em> to take up his abode at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. During Smetana's administration, and particularly during that of Mauron, the congregation made rapid progress. The number of provinces in 1852 &mdash; not including <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a> and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> &mdash; was four; in 1890 they had increased to twelve. The French-Swiss province, presided over by <a href="../cathen/04756b.htm">Father Desurmont</a> for twenty-two years (1865-87), gained admission into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and South America. During the presidency of <a href="../cathen/06379b.htm">Garc&iacute;a Moreno</a> two houses were established in the Republic of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a>. A few years later the congregation gained a foothold in <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a>, and Colombia. The original <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> province, having grown very rapidly, was divided into the provinces of <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. The Lower German province found a new field of labour in the eastern part of South America. The province of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> received charge of the mission at Surinam; South America, a settlement colonized partly by <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>.

<p>The American province of the congregation, erected in 1850, has had a striking development. Its first provincial was the Rev. Bernard Hafkenscheid, a fellow-student of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>. One of his first cares was the establishment of a <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> and the selection of a suitable place for a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. He chose Cumberland, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, for the future house of studies. From this nursery of study and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> many able and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> missionaries went forth. In 1853 the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, which had been located since 1849 at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, was removed to Annapolis, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>. Here the heirs of <a href="../cathen/03379c.htm">Charles Carroll of Carrollton</a> had donated their entire estate to the Redemptorist Fathers. This house remained the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> until 1907, with the exception of the years 1862-66, when it was at Cumberland, and the students at Annapolis. In 1858-59 the present church and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> were built at Annapolis. In 1868 the students were transferred to the new house of studies at Ilchester, <a href="../cathen/09755b.htm">Maryland</a>, which remained the <a href="../cathen/01326c.htm">Alma</a> Mater of the Redemptorists until 1907. In that year the faculty and the students, forty-eight in number, took up their abode at Esopus, on the Hudson, where a more spacious scholasticate had been erected. From the first house of St. Alphonsus in Baltimore sprang other communities: St. Michael's in 1859, St. James's in 1867, and the Sacred Heart in 1878. In 1882, owing to difficulties in the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, the Fathers, at the earnest request of <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a>, then <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a>, Gibbons, assumed charge of the <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemians</a>. In this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> five other <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, one in the city of Washington, were originally founded by the Redemptorists. In 1861 the congregation was called to <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, to take charge of St. Michael's parish. It was not long before a large church and a commodious <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> were built. The great fire of 1871 destroyed all these structures, but, thanks to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and generosity of the people, they were rebuilt.

<p>The many successful missions which the Redemptorists had given in the Diocese of St. Louis induced <a href="../cathen/08618a.htm">Archbishop Kenrick</a> to ask for a foundation of the congregation in his episcopal city, and in 1866 a mission house was opened at St. Louis. In the same year (1866) another mission house was established in New York, near the little <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Alphonsus, which had been erected in 1845 for the convenience of the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a> in that section of the city; it had been served by Fathers of the Third Street community. Though now a mission church, St. Alphonsus's continued to be a <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church for the <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germans</a>. Subsequently, two more foundations were made in New York, one for <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemian</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and the other for the German <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the northern part of the city. In 1871 an important mission house was opened at Roxbury, <a href="../cathen/02703a.htm">Boston</a>. It was dedicated to Our Lady of Perpetual Help. Its first <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a>, the Rev. William H. Gross, was succeeded by the Rev. Leopold Petsch, when the former became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13488a.htm">Savannah</a> in 1873. In 1883, when a new <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> was formed in that district, the Fathers of the mission church took charge of it. As early as 1874 the Redemptorists of the American province were called to St. Patrick's Church, Quebec, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, the only <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church in that city for English-speaking <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Four years later the American Fathers became the custodians of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> shrine of Ste-Anne de Beaupr&eacute;, near Quebec; it was eventually transferred to the Fathers of the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> province. The same Fathers assumed charge of St. Anne's, <a href="../cathen/10547b.htm">Montreal</a>, a large <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> in a very poor district of the city. The Baltimore province in the meantime established two other foundations in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>: St. Patrick's, <a href="../cathen/14781d.htm">Toronto</a>, in 1881, and St. Peter's, St. John, N. B., in 1884. In 1876 the congregation was invited to take a second church in Philadelphia, that of St. Boniface. Besides these houses the province of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> founded in 1881 a separate house for its juvenate, or junior house of studies, at Northeast, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. Another house, to be used as a primary juvenate, was purchased in 1886 at Saratoga, New York; this is at present a mission house. In 1893 a new house was opened at <a href="../cathen/02798d.htm">Brooklyn</a>, New York.

<p>In 1875 the original American province was divided, the eastern under the name of the province of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and the western as the province of St. Louis. This latter province embraced the houses of St. Louis, <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>, and Chatawa. This last-named place was selected for the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and house of studies for the province of St. Louis, but was subsequently abandoned. Since 1875 several new foundations have been established. In 1878 Kansas City, <a href="../cathen/10398a.htm">Missouri</a>, was selected for an <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institution</a>. The old house of St. Mary's at <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a> was abandoned in 1872, but in 1880 another house was established in the suburbs of the same city; this is now a flourishing mission and <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church. Two years later the Redemptorists began a second foundation at <a href="../cathen/03653a.htm">Chicago</a>. In 1887 a juvenate was erected at Kirkwood, near St. Louis, and in 1888 the Fathers settled at <a href="../cathen/06726a.htm">Grand Rapids</a>, Michigan. In 1891 a foundation was made at <a href="../cathen/13665a.htm">Seattle</a>, Washington, in 1897 a new house of studies was erected at De Soto, Missouri. In 1894 the Fathers went to <a href="../cathen/04733c.htm">Denver, Colorado</a>, and took charge of St. Joseph's Church; in 1906 to <a href="../cathen/12287a.htm">Portland</a>, <a href="../cathen/11288a.htm">Oregon</a>; in 1908 to <a href="../cathen/04640a.htm">Davenport</a>, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>, and to Fresno, <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a>. In 1910 a new house was founded at Oconomowoc, <a href="../cathen/15661b.htm">Wisconsin</a>, which will be the future house of studies of the province of St. Louis.

<p>Despite the manifold labours and the limited number of Fathers, the preaching of missions, the special work of the sons of St. Alphonsus, was never neglected. In 1850, however, it received a powerful impetus under the first provincial, Father Bernard. Shortly after his arrival in America he organized and trained what may be called the first band of regular missionaries, among whom were the eminent converts, Fathers <a href="../cathen/07186a.htm">Hecker</a>, <a href="../cathen/07309b.htm">Hewit</a>, and Walworth; these distinguished missionaries afterwards established the Congregation of the <a href="../cathen/11587c.htm">Paulists</a>. Since then the work of the missions has increased rapidly from year to year; thus a double activity, <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> work and mission work, has become a special feature of the congregation in North America. Some <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the work of the Baltimore province during the ten years from 1890 to 1899 is conveyed by the following figures: missions and renewals, 1889; retreats, 1071; other exercises, 75; confessions, 2,418,758; converts, 1252. Parish work: <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptisms</a>, 54,608; communions, 6,827,000; first communions, 19,077; <a href="../cathen/09707a.htm">marriages</a>, 8311; average number of <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> children, 13,000; converts, 1922.

<p>The administration of Father Mauron was rendered memorable by several important events. In 1866 <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> caused the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> picture of Our Lady of Perpetual Help to be placed in the Redemptorist Church at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15459a.htm">devotion to the Blessed Virgin</a> under this attractive title has since then spread far and wide. In 1871 the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, moved by the urgent and repeated petitions of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and heads of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, bestowed the title of <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">Doctor of the Universal Church</a> upon St. Alphonsus, known the world over by his <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and devotional writings. <a href="../cathen/04044a.htm">Father Hofbauer</a>, the Apostle of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatified</a> in 1889, and <a href="../cathen/06467c.htm">Brother Gerard Majella</a>, the <em>thaumaturgus</em> of the congregation, in 1893. The latter was <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonized</a> by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a>, 11 Dec., 1904. The eventful administration of Father Mauron ended in 1893. In 1882 he was stricken with apoplexy, and, though he rallied from the shock, a slow decline set in, and he died 13 July, 1893. On 1 March, 1894, Very Rev. Mathias Raus was elected superior general. He was born 9 Aug., 1829, in the <a href="../cathen/09465a.htm">Duchy of Luxemburg</a>; made his profession 1 Nov., 1853, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 8 Aug., 1858. After filling various important offices in the order, he was called to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by his predecessor to be one of the general consultors. Father Raus's administration is remarkable for the number of Redemptorist causes of <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">beatification</a> introduced, or about to be introduced, in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, thirteen in all. Among them are: Ven. John Nepomucene Neumann, superior of the American Province, who died as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Philadelphia, 5 Jan., 1860; <a href="../cathen/13681b.htm">Father Francis X. Seelos</a>, of the American province, who died a victim of yellow fever at <a href="../cathen/11005b.htm">New Orleans</a>, 4 Oct., 1867; and <a href="../cathen/05129b.htm">Father Peter Donders</a>, the Apostle of the Lepers in Surinam, who died in the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> colony at Batavia, in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Dutch</a> Guiana, 14 Jan., 1887. To these may be added Father Alfred Pampelon, who died at Ste-Anne de Beaupr&eacute; in <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, 30 Sept., 1896. Father Raus's administration was closed by the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> issue of the cause of <a href="../cathen/04044a.htm">Blessed Clement M. Hofbauer's</a> <a href="../cathen/02364b.htm">canonization</a>, which took place on 20 May, 1909. In that year the venerable superior, having attained his eighty-second year, deemed it wise to resign his responsible office, and in the general chapter opened on 26 April, 1909, the Very Rev. Father Patrick Murray, superior of the <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> province, was elected superior general of the congregation. He was born 24 Nov., 1865, made his profession 23 Oct., 1889, and was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> 10 Sept., 1890.

<p>During the past twelve years the development of the congregation has been very marked. The Roman province was particularly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, when he confided to the Fathers the magnificent new <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Joachim in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. The French province was divided into three provinces and two vice-provinces in 1900. <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> became a province, having eight houses, to which recently two more communities were added. The French province proper was divided into two provinces, <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a> and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>. To the former now belong the Southern Pacific vice-province, embracing <a href="../cathen/03660a.htm">Chile</a> and <a href="../cathen/11732b.htm">Peru</a>, and to the latter the Northern vice-province of <a href="../cathen/05278a.htm">Ecuador</a> and Colombia. Since the suppression of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in 1904, some of the Redemptorist communities have undertaken new foundations in <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and others in South America. In 1900 the Austrian province was also divided into two provinces, <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and Prague, with a Polish vice-province. The latter was made a province in 1909. Since the division the <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Viennese</a> opened two houses in <a href="../cathen/04722c.htm">Denmark</a>, one in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> Silesia, and a fourth at <a href="../cathen/09273a.htm">Linz</a>. In 1899 the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> Fathers were requested by the Government to take charge of a number of missions in the Congo State; these missions have now increased to six, Matadi, Tumba, Kionzo, Kinkanda, Kimpesse, and Sonagongo. The Fathers are deeply indebted to the paternal Government of the Congo State for the progress they have made since their arrival in 1899. Several valuable missionaries have already fallen victims to the treacherous climate.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, which was made a vice-province in 1894, four more houses were opened. This vice-province, depending on the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> province, numbers six houses. In the West Indies, which were also made a vice-province in 1904, there are now six houses. The province of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a> opened in 1902 a foundation at Mayag&uuml;ez in <a href="../cathen/12291b.htm">Porto Rico</a>. Before the occupation of the island by the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> Redemptorists had settled at <a href="../cathen/13447a.htm">San Juan</a>, but at the close of the Cuban War returned to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The American Fathers are now there as missionaries and <a href="../cathen/11537b.htm">pastors</a>. A <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> comprising some 30,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is confided to their care. Despite all their labours for the benefit of the natives their progress is very slow. On 26 July, 1911, the <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgian</a> houses of <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a> were erected into a new province.

<p>The Upper German or <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a> province, which was under the ban of the <em><a href="../cathen/08703b.htm">Kulturkampf</a></em>, has recovered some of its lost ground. Since its readmittance, it has added another very important foundation. But the historic <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Alt&ouml;tting has passed into other hands. In 1894 this province opened in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a> a mission of two houses forming a vice-province. The province of <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a> has added to its mission in Surinam a mission in <a href="../cathen/02745c.htm">Brazil</a>, forming another vice-province, having under its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> three houses.

<p>A more detailed account of the English and Irish provinces claims our attention.

<p>The English province, begun from <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a> in 1843, owes its great progress to the <a href="../cathen/04093c.htm">Rev. Robert A. Coffin</a>, one of the band of converts associated with <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a>, <a href="../cathen/09604b.htm">Manning</a>, and Faber in the <a href="../cathen/11370a.htm">Oxford Movement</a>. After his <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> he joined the Redemptorists, and gave missions throughout <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, until he was appointed first <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a> of the English province in 1865. During his administration of seventeen years new houses were founded in various parts of the United Kingdom, the house at Perth being the first <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> opened in <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a> since the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> appointed the <a href="../cathen/04093c.htm">Rev. Robert A. Coffin</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14162b.htm">Southwark</a>. His successor as provincial, the Rev. Hugh McDonald, died <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01041c.htm">Aberdeen</a>, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>. The activity of the English Fathers is evidenced by their literary labours and their success on the missions, which resulted in more than 16,000 converts. At present the province has eight houses: Clapham, Bishop-Eton, Monkwearmouth, Bishop's Stortford, Kingswood, Edmonton, and the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and house of studies at Perth, <a href="../cathen/13613a.htm">Scotland</a>, with a total membership of one hundred and twenty-three. Besides the <a href="../cathen/04093c.htm">Rev. Robert A. Coffin</a>, a number of noted converts have joined the congregation, among them <a href="../cathen/02782b.htm">Bridgett</a>, Livius, and Douglas.

<p>In 1898 the houses in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> and Australia, hitherto subject to the English province, were constituted an <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> province, and Australia, a vice-province, as its dependency. The Rev. Andrew Boylan was appointed the first provincial, with his residence at <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>. On 25 March, 1901, the foundation of the present new juvenate house at <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a> was laid. The province of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a> comprises four houses: Limerick, Dundalk, Belfast, and Esker; the vice-province of <a href="../cathen/02113b.htm">Australia</a>, three houses: Waratah in New South Wales, Ballarat in <a href="../cathen/15412b.htm">Victoria</a>, and Perth in Western Australia. The total membership is one hundred and forty-seven. In 1906 the Rev. Andrew Boylan was commissioned to visit the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>, and to establish there a colony of <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> Redemptorists. At present there are two Redemptorist Houses on these Islands and one in <a href="../cathen/15580a.htm">Wellington</a>, New Zealand. The church at <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a> is celebrated for its Confraternity of the Holy Family for men and boys, founded by the Rev. Edward Bridgett, which the late <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09262a.htm">Limerick</a>, Dr. Butler, called "the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> wrought by the Mother of Perpetual Succour, a far greater <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> than the cure of a blind boy or the healing of a cripple". In 1903 it had the following membership: Monday, division of men, 2722; Tuesday, division of men, 2580, boys' division, 1226; total, 6528. Meetings are held every week, the average attendance being 3992, while the communions received in the confraternity during 1902 numbered: men, 39,860, boys, 8497; total 48,357.

<p>The following figures will exemplify the growth of the congregation. The number of subjects in 1852 (not including those of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>) were: <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 343; professed students, 75; <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novice</a>, 12; choir <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, 45; professed <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, 175; lay <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, 67; total, 715; houses, 45. In 1910 (including <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>) <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, 2085; professed students, 537; choir <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, 142; professed <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, 962; lay <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, 343; total, 4069; houses, 218; provinces, 19; vice-provinces, 10. The constant and rapid growth of the congregation must be attributed chiefly to the erection of the so-called juvenates. Finding it difficult in some countries and impossible in others to secure a solid future for the different provinces, the Fathers deemed it expedient to receive boys who showed a disposition for the religious and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> life, and to prepare them while still young for the higher studies. <a href="../cathen/04044a.htm">Father Hofbauer</a> adopted this plan, and obtained thereby a number of excellent young men for the order. In the same way Father Passerat was equally successful in drawing young men to the congregation. It was in this manner that Father Mauron, the late superior general, was attracted to the order. But it was only after 1867 or 1868 that a definite scheme of preparing boys for the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> was followed. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was taken up simultaneously in the French and American provinces. <a href="../cathen/04756b.htm">Father Desurmont</a> was the first to organize this preparatory institution in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. For many years it was customary for the American Fathers to select from their <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parochial</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> boys who, in their opinion, would eventually become fit subjects for the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. After having tested their ability, they instructed them personally in the rudiments of Latin, or sent them to a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> college until they reached their sixteenth year. At this age they were admitted to the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>, after which they completed their humanities. For the benefit of boys who did not belong to Redemptorist <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> or who lived in other cities the <a href="../cathen/12514b.htm">provincial</a>, Father Helmpraecht (1865-77), secured a suitable place near his residence at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. One of the Fathers was appointed director. In 1869 a new method was followed. The young men were to finish their classical course before entering the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. To accommodate the increasing number of pupils, provision was made at <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, then at Ilchester, until finally, in 1881, a desirable college building was purchased at Northeast, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>. Here a six years' classical course is pursued, while at the same time the moral and physical fitness of the young men may be easily ascertained. Similar preparatory colleges, with some slight differences, have been introduced into almost every province. After a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> of one year, the young members pass to the higher course of studies. This embraces two years' philosophy, two years' dogmatic, and two years' <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, with natural philosophy, <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scripture</a>, canon law, pastoral theology, and homiletics. After the completion of their studies the young <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> make what is called the "second <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>" of six months, during which time they are trained theoretically and practically in the special work of the missions.

<p>Although the limited number of subjects and the manifold labours of the ministry do not permit the members of the congregation to make a specialty of it, still their literary work is not inconsiderable. Among Redemptorist authors the following may be mentioned: <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>: Januar. Sarnelli, Bl. Panzutti, Anton.
