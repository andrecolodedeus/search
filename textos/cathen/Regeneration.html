<h1>Regeneration</h1>  

<p>(Latin <em>regeneratio</em>; Greek <em>anagennesis</em> and <em>paliggenesia</em>).

<p>Regeneration is a Biblico-dogmatic term closely connected with the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of justification, Divine sonship, and the deification of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> through grace. Confining ourselves first to the Biblical use of this term, we find regeneration from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> used in indissoluble connection with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> expressly calls "the laver of regeneration" (<a href="../bible/tit003.htm#vrs5">Titus 3:5</a>). In His discourse with Nicodemus (<a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs5">John 3:5</a>), the Saviour declares: "Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." In this passage <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> from its earliest days has found the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> may not be repeated, since a repeated regeneration from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is no less a contradiction than repeated physical birth from a mother. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of "birth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" enjoys a special favour in the Joannine <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>. Outside the Fourth Gospel (<a href="../bible/joh001.htm#vrs12">1:12 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/joh003.htm#vrs5">3:5</a>), the Apostle uses the term in a variety of ways, treating "birth of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" as synonymous now with the "doing of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>" (<a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#vrs1">1 John 5:1, 4 sq.</a>), and elsewhere deducing from it a certain "sinlessness" of the just (<a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#vrs9">1 John 3:9</a>; <a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#vrs18">5:18</a>), which, however, does not necessarily exclude from the state of justification the possibility of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinning</a> (cf. <a href="../cathen/02411d.htm">Bellarmine</a>, "De justificatione", III, xv). It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that in all these passages there is no reference to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> nor is there any reference to a real "regeneration"; nevertheless, "generation from God", like <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptismal</a> "regeneration", must be referred to justification as its cause. Both terms effectually refute the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> notion that there is in justification not a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> annihilation, but merely a covering up of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which still continue (covering-up theory), or that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> won is simply the imputation of the external <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> or Christ (imputation theory).

<p>The very <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of spiritual palingenesis requires that the justified man receive through the Divine generation a quasi-Divine nature as his "second <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>", which cannot be conceived as a state of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but only as a state of interior <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Thus alone can we explain the statements that the just man is assured "participation in the divine nature" (cf. <a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#vrs4">2 Peter 1:4</a>: <em>divin&aelig; consortes natur&aelig;</em>), becomes "a new creature" (<a href="../bible/gal005.htm#vrs6">Galatians 5:6</a>; <a href="../bible/gal006.htm#vrs15">6:15</a>), effects which depend on justifying <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> working by charity, not on "faith alone" (<em>sola fides</em>). When the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> elsewhere refers regeneration to the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection of Jesus Christ</a> (<a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#vrs3">1 Peter 1:3</a>) or to "the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who liveth and remaineth forever" (<a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#vrs23">1 Peter 1:23</a>), it indicates two important external factors for justification, which have nothing to do with its formal cause. The latter text shows that the preaching of the Word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is for the sinner the introductory step towards justification, which is impossible without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whereas the former text mentions the meritorious cause of justification, inasmuch as, from the Biblical standpoint, the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> was the final act in the work of <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs46">Luke 24:46 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/rom004.htm#vrs25">Romans 4:25</a>; <a href="../bible/rom006.htm#vrs4">6:4</a>; <a href="../bible/2co005.htm#vrs16">2 Corinthians 5:16</a>). To the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of regeneration, generation out of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, participation in the Divine nature, and re-creation, a fifth, that of Divine sonship, must be added; this represents the formal effect of justification and is <a href="../cathen/04380a.htm">crowned</a> by the personal indwelling of the Holy Ghost in the justified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/rom005.htm#vrs5">Romans 5:5</a>; <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs11">8:11</a>; <a href="../bible/1co003.htm#vrs16">1 Corinthians 3:16 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/1co006.htm#vrs19">6:19</a>, etc.). Since, however, this Divine sonship is expressly described as a mere adoptive sonship (<em>filiatio adoptiva</em>, <em>ouiothesis</em>; cf. <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#vrs15">Romans 8:15 sqq.</a>; <a href="../bible/gal004.htm#vrs5">Galatians 4:5</a>), it is evident that "regeneration from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>" implies no substantial emerging of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the nature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as in the case of the eternal generation of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> (Christ), but must be regarded as an analogical and accidental generation from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>As regards the use of the term in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, no connected history of regeneration can be written, as neither <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> antiquity nor <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">medieval Scholasticism</a> worked consistently and regularly to develop this pregnant and fruitful <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a>. At every period, however, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Sacrament of Baptism</a> was regarded as the specific sacrament of regeneration, a concept that was not extended to the <a href="../cathen/11618c.htm">Sacrament of Penance</a>. Iren&aelig;us repeatedly interprets the Pauline term "re-creation" as the universal regeneration of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> through the incarnation of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in the womb of the Blessed Virgin. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of regeneration in the sense of individual justification is most conspicuous in the writings of <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>. With an unrivalled keenness, he evolved the essential distinction between the birth of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> from the substance of the Father and the generation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through grace, and brought together into an organic association regeneration, with its kindred <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, and justification (cf. e.g. <a href="../fathers/1801049.htm"><em>Enarration on Psalm 49</em>, no. 2</a>). Like the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, St. Augustine associates justification with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> working through charity, and refers its essence to the interior renewal and sanctification of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Thus, St. Augustine is not only the precursor, but also the model of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastics</a>, who worked mainly on the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> inherited from the great doctor, and contributed essentially to the speculative understanding of the mysterious process of justification. Adhering strictly to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and tradition, the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> (Sess. VI, capp. iii-iv, in <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, "Enchiridion", 10th ed., 1908, nn. 795-6) regarded regeneration as fundamentally nothing else than another name for the justification acquired through the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">Sacrament of Baptism</a>. A characteristic view was that of the German Mystics (<a href="../cathen/05274a.htm">Eckhart</a>, <a href="../cathen/14465c.htm">Tauler</a>, <a href="../cathen/07238c.htm">Suso</a>), who prefer to speak of a "birth of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>", meaning thereby the self-annihilation of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> submerging itself in the Divinity, and the resulting mystical union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.

<p>In <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, since the time of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, we meet great differences of opinion, which are of course to be referred to the various conceptions of the nature of justification. In entire accordance with his <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> identified regeneration with the Divine "bestowal of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>" (<em>donatio fidei</em>), and placed the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> infant on the same footing as the adult, although he could give no precise explanation as to the way in which the child at its regeneration in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> could exercise justifying <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (cf. H. Cremer, "Taufe, Wiedergeburt und Kindertaufe", 2nd ed., 1901). Against the shallow and destructive efforts of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>, which made its appearance among the <a href="../cathen/14113a.htm">Socinians</a> about the end of the sixteenth century and later received a mighty impulse from <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deism</a>, the German "Enlightenment", and French Encyclopedism, a salutary reaction was produced by the <a href="../cathen/12080c.htm">Pietists</a> during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Leaving far behind the old <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> view, the <a href="../cathen/12080c.htm">Pietists</a> (Spener, A. H. Francke, Zinzendorf) referred regeneration to the personal experience of justification in union with a sincere conversion to a new life, consisting especially in charitable activity. German <a href="../cathen/12080c.htm">Pietism</a>, systematically cultivated by the so-called Hernhuter, exercised a beneficial effect on English Methodism, which went about securing and strengthening regeneration in "methodical fashion", and which undoubtedly performed good service in the revival of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Especially those sudden <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">conversions</a>--such as are even today striven for and highly prized in <a href="../cathen/10237b.htm">Methodist</a> circles, the American revivals and camp meetings, the Salvation Army, and the German <em>Gemeinschaftsbewegung</em>, with all its excrescences and eccentricities--are preferentially given the title of regeneration (cf. E. Wacker, "Wiedergeburt und Bekehrung", 1893). Since Schleiermacher the variety and confusion of the views concerning the character of regeneration in learned literature have increased rather than diminished; it is indeed almost a case of everyone to his own liking. The greatest favour in Liberal and modern Positive <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> is enjoyed by the theory of Albert <a href="../cathen/13086a.htm">Ritschl</a>, according to which the two distinct moments of justification and reconciliation hold the same relation to each other as forgiveness and regeneration. As soon as resistance to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is done away with in justification, and lack of trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>--or, in other words, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>--is overcome in the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, reconciliation with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and regeneration enter into their <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, thus inaugurating a new life of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> activity which reveals itself in the fulfilment of all the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of one's station.

<p>Turning finally to the non-Christian use of the term, we find "regeneration" in common use in many <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>. In <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Persian Mithraism</a>, which spread widely in the West as a religion of the soldiers and officials under the Roman Empire, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> initiated into the mysteries were designated "regenerated" (<em>renatus</em>). While here the word retains its ethico-religious sense, there was a complete change of meaning in <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> which taught <a href="../cathen/10234d.htm">metempsychosis</a> or the transmigration of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> (Pythagoreans, Druids, Indians), in these the reincarnation of departed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> was termed "regeneration". This usage has not yet entirely disappeared, as it is current among the <a href="../cathen/14626a.htm">Theosophists</a> (cf. E.R. Hull, "Theosophy and Christianity", <a href="../cathen/02644a.htm">Bombay</a>, 1909; and in connection therewith "Stimmen aus Maria-Laach", 1910, 387 sqq., 479 sqq.). This view should not be confounded with the use <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself, who (<a href="../bible/mat019.htm#vrs18">Matthew 19:18</a>) speaks of the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection of the dead</a> on the last day as a regeneration (<em>regeneratio</em>).
