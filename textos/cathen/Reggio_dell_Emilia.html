<h1>Reggio dell' Emilia</h1>  

<p>DIOCESE OF REGGIO DELL' EMILIA (REGINENSIS)

<p>Suffragan of <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a> in central <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. The city is situated just where the ancient Via &AElig;milia is crossed by the small River Crostolo, which flows into the River Po, through a very fertile territory. The principal industries are silk, straws, and osiers. The <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> is Romanesque, of the twelfth century, restored in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and has some remains of thirteenth century frescoes. In the museum is the scientific collection of <a href="../cathen/14209a.htm">Abbate Spallanzani</a>, an illustrious <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, prehistoric antiques, and an art collection. The <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> has about 1000 <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a>. There are also the state archives. Near Reggio is the famous Castle of <a href="../cathen/03298a.htm">Canossa</a>.

<p>Regium belonged to the Boii and was reduced into a colony by the consul &AElig;milius Lepidus (187 or 178) and was by him named <em>Regium Lepidi</em>. In the Treaty of Quiercy Reggio was included among the towns which Pepin had in mind to give to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, but it never came into possession of the latter, except later, and for a short time. In 962 it was given with <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a> to Count Azzo of <a href="../cathen/03298a.htm">Canossa</a>. After the death of Countess Matilda (1165) the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> claimed the town as a part of her inheritance, while the emperors claimed the same as a fief of the Empire. Pending these disputes the town was governed in a communal way; at first they had consuls and in 1156 they had a bailiff, named mostly by the emperor. Reggio took part in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> between the Lombard cities, especially against Mantua and <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. It was mostly on the side of the <a href="../cathen/07056c.htm">Ghibellines</a>, although in 1167 it entered the Lombard League and in 1193 the league against Henry VI. After the misfortune of <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, the powerful Pico, Fogliani, Carpineti, and Coreglio were disputing the mastery of the city, which fell into the hands of Obizzo d'Este, Lord of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, but revolted against his son Azzo VIII (1306), became again a commune, accepted the vicars of Henry VII and Louis the <a href="../cathen/02353c.htm">Bavarian</a>; was subject to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> under Cardinal Bertrand du Poyet (1322); and later (1331), John of <a href="../cathen/02612b.htm">Bohemia</a>, who recognized the suzerainty of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> over Reggio as well as over <a href="../cathen/11505a.htm">Parma</a> and <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, was made lord of the city, but sold it to the Fogliani, from whom it passed to the Gonzaga of <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a> (1335), who sold it to Galeazzo Visconti of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>. In 1409 it returned again to the House of Este of the line of <a href="../cathen/10413a.htm">Modena</a>, until 1859. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, however, always claimed to be its suzerains. After the <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> War, Reggio spontaneously submitted to <a href="../cathen/08562a.htm">Julius II</a> (1512-15). By the Peace of Barcelona (1529) <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> bound himself to give back Reggio to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, but he did not do so. In 1848 Reggio proclaimed its annexation to <a href="../cathen/12076b.htm">Piedmont</a>, completed in 1859. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> entered Reggio probably from <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>; a local legend makes the first <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> St. Protasius, a disciple of St. Apollinaris, in the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Apostolic</a> age. Admitting his existence, also five or six historical <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, predecessors of Faventius in 451, it would seem that the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopal see</a> dates from the first half of the fourth century. St. Prosper was the successor of Faventius; he died between 461 and 467. Among other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were: Thomas (c. 701), Nodoberto, ambassador of Louis the Pious at Constantinople (817); Azzo II, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murdered</a> during the Hungarian invasion in 900; Thenzo (978), who rebuilt the Basilica of St. Prosper and other churches; Nicolo Maltraversi (1211), much praised by the chronicler <a href="../cathen/13400a.htm">Salimbene</a> and often ambassador to <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>; Enrico de Casalocci (1302); Battista Pallavicini* (1445), the sacred poet; Marcello Cervini (1540), later Pope Marcellus II; Cardinal Alessandro d'Este (1621); Angelo M. Ficarelli (1821), who repaired the damages of the revolution.

<p>The diocese has 246 <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a>, 531 <a href="../cathen/13675a.htm">secular priests</a>, 175,600 inhabitants; 4 houses of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> with 29 priests; 11 houses of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, 5 <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a> for boys and 13 for girls, and a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> weekly.
<h2>University of Reggio</h2>

<p>Reggio was recognized as a <em>studium generale</em> as early as 1210; and a doctoral diploma of 1276 has been preserved, showing that there were a regular College of Doctors, regular examinations, and a <em>Universitas scholarium</em> (Tacoli, "Memorie storiche di Reggio", pt. III, <a href="../cathen/03374b.htm">Carpi</a>, 1769, 215-16). But at the beginning of the fourteenth century there was no longer a single doctor in the city; and the <em>studium generale</em> had evidently lapsed before this.
