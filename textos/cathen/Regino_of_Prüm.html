<h1>Regino of Pr&uuml;m</h1>  

<p>Date of birth unknown; d. at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> in 915. According to the statements of a later era Regino was the son of noble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and was born at the stronghold of Altrip on the Rhine near Speyer. Nothing is known concerning his life until he was elected <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> of Pr&uuml;m in 892. From his election as <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> and from his writings, it is evident that he had entered the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine Order</a>, probably at <a href="../cathen/12519a.htm">Pr&uuml;m</a> itself, and that he had been a diligent student. The rich and celebrated Abbey of Pr&uuml;m suffered greatly during the ninth century from the marauding incursions of the Normans. It had been twice seized and ravaged, in 882 and 892. After its second devastation the Abbot Farabert resigned his office and Regino was elected his successor. His labours for the restoration of the devastated <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> were hampered by the struggle between contending parties in <a href="../cathen/09362a.htm">Lorraine</a>. In 899 Regino was driven from his office by Richarius, later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09236a.htm">Li&egrave;ge</a>, the brother of Count Gerhard and count Mattfried of Hennegau. Richarius was made <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a>; Regino resigned the position and retired to <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>, where he was honourably received by Archbishop Ratbod. He supported the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> in the latter's efforts to carry out <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reforms in that troubled era, rebuilt the Abbey of St. Martin that had been laid waste by the Normans, accompanied the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> on visitations, and used his leisure for writing. At Ratbod's suggestion he wrote his work on <a href="../cathen/05030a.htm">ecclesiastical discipline</a> for use in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> visitations (see <a href="../cathen/03281a.htm">COLLECTIONS OF ANCIENT CANONS</a>, III, 286); he also wrote a treatise "De harmonica institutione" [ed. <a href="../cathen/04453b.htm">Coussemaker</a>, "Scriptores de musica medii aevi", II (Paris, 1867), 1-73], for the improvement of <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> singing; further, his great historical work, the chronicle (see <a href="../cathen/01531b.htm">ANNALS</a>). Regino was buried in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of St. Maximin near <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a>.
