<h1>Reichenau</h1>  

<p>Reichenau, called <em>Augia Dives</em> in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Latin <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> and possessing a once celebrated <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, is an island upon the Gnadensee (Untersee) of the Lake of Constance, about one mile in breadth and about three and three-quarter miles long. It belongs to <a href="../cathen/02194a.htm">Baden</a>, and has 1600 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> inhabitants, principally vintagers and fishermen, distributed among three villages, Oberzell, Mittelzell, and Unterzell (or Niederzell). Since 1838 the island has been connected with the mainland by a dam, one and a quarter miles in length, and with the railroad station of Reichenau (via <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a>). There is a calling station for steamers on the southern shore. The word "Zell" (cell) in the names of the three villages of Reichenau indicates the existence of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> on the island, which was the "reiche Aue" (the fertile islet) of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> culture. Under the protection and at the suggestion of <a href="../cathen/03629a.htm">Charles Martel</a>, the Anglo-Saxon (?), Saint Pirmin founded, with the cooperation of Count Berthold and the Alemannian Duke Santfrid I (Nebi), the famous <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Reichenau, which in earlier times, until the tenth century, bore the name of Sintleosesau (Sintlas Ow). Reichenau had attained its full glory when the Abbey of St. Gall was still comparatively unimportant. In spite of St. Pirmin's banishment from his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> through the political machinations of the Alemannian prince, Reichenau soon recovered its importance. His immediate successor, Abbot Heddo (727-34), later <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/14313c.htm">Strasburg</a>, the fate of the founder. The growth of Reichenau was greatly fostered by its position on the highway to <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, which was frequented by Greek and Italian, and even <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Irish</a> and <a href="../cathen/07615b.htm">Icelandic</a> <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> and wayfarers. These became guests at the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and enriched it with gifts of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">precious relics</a>, some of which are still preserved in the church treasury. Among other <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> was one of special value, a cross with the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which was said to have been brought by an Arabian named Hassan to <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, and to have been confided to the custody of Reichenau in 925. The <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> also glorified in the possession of <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of St. Mark, brought to Reichenau from <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> in 830. On his homeward journey from <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">St. Maurice</a> and other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, <a href="../cathen/15123a.htm">Bishop Ulrich of Augsburg</a> stayed at Reichenau, and at the petition of Abbot Alewich (934-58), gave a large portion of the <a href="../cathen/12734a.htm">relics</a> of <a href="../cathen/10068c.htm">Saint Maurice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Bishop Egino of <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> resided in Reichenau, and built (799) the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter at Niederzell, a small Roman basilica with two towers, whither he retired to lead the life of a <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a>, dying in 802. His monument still exists. The <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was composed principally of donations made by <a href="../cathen/03610c.htm">Charlemagne</a>, Louis the Pious, Charles the Fat (who is <a href="../cathen/03071a.htm">interred</a> at Reichenau in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> church of Mittelzell), and many other German kings and emperors, especially of the House of Otto. The consequence of these royal favours was the rapid growth of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> in importance, being granted successively immunity from <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authority</a>, <em>jurisdictio fori</em> the status of a principality of the empire, and complete exemption from episcopal <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>.

<p>Reichenau displayed its greatest lustre in the first centuries after its foundation (especially between the ninth and the middle of the thirteenth centuries), during which it discharged its great work of civilization. The men most prominent for scholarship and ability during this period laboured at Reichenau &#151; e.g. Walafrid Strabo (839-849); <a href="../cathen/07149c.htm">Hatto</a> (891-913), from 891 <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09550a.htm">Mainz</a>; Berno (1008-48), appointed by Henry II successor of the uncultured Abbot Immo, who had been thrust upon the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> by the same emperor; St. Meinrad (Meynrad), Count of Zollern (d. 861), the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermit</a> and founder of Maria-Einsiedeln, who came from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Reichenau; moreover, <a href="../cathen/07266a.htm">Hermann Contractus</a> (d. 1054), the acute scholar and historiographer, author of the <em>Salve Regina</em>. The last was a relative of <a href="../cathen/15123a.htm">St. Ulrich.</a> These and other scholars laboured at Reichenau and formed the famous Reichenau <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painters</a> (Codex Egberti). The Reichenau <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> is seen at its best even today in the single extant work of the tenth century &#151; the eight pictures on the upper part of the walls of the little Roman basilican <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> church (St. Georgskirche) at Oberzell - and in the <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> on the walls of the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Peter at Niederzell, which belong to the first half of the eleventh century, and were discovered by K&uuml;nstle and Begerle in 1901. As a consequence of its prosperity, laxity and decay came upon the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and caused its incorporation with the <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Diocese of Constance</a> in 1541. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/04286c.htm">Constance</a> thus became commendatory <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbots</a>, and the personnel of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was reduced to twelve <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> (inclusive of the prior) and a small number of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>. In 1757 the few remaining <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> were forcibly removed to other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> abolished. Members of neighbouring <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> performed the religious services at Reichenau until the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was secularized in 1802.
