<h2 id="i">Derivation, analysis, and definition</h2>

<p>The derivation of the word "religion" has been a matter of dispute from ancient times. Not even today is it a closed question. Cicero, in his "De natura deorum", II, xxviii, derives religion from <em>relegere</em> (to treat carefully): "Those who carefully took in hand all things pertaining to the gods were called <em>religiosi</em>, from <em>relegere</em>." Max Muller favoured this view. But as religion is an elementary notion long antedating the time of complicated ritual presupposed in this explanation, we must seek elsewhere for its etymology. A far more likely derivation, one that suits the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of religion in its simple beginning, is that given by Lactantius, in his "Divine Institutes", IV, xxviii. He derives religion from religare (to bind): "We are tied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and bound to Him [<em>religati</em>] by the bond of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and it is from this, and not, as Cicero holds, from careful consideration [<em>relegendo</em>], that religion has received its name." The objection that <em>religio</em> could not be derived from <em>religare</em>, a verb of the first conjugation, is not of great weight, when we call to mind that <em>opinio</em> comes from <em>opinari</em>, and <em>rebellio</em> from <em>rebellare</em>. <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a>, in his <a href="../fathers/120110.htm"><em>City of God</em> X.3</a>, derives <em>religio</em> from <em>religere</em> in the sense of recovering: "having lost <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through neglect [<em>negligentes</em>], we recover Him [<em>religentes</em>] and are drawn to Him." This explanation, implying the notion of the Redemption, is not suited to the primary <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of religion. St. Augustine himself was not satisfied with it, for in his "Retractions", I, xiii, he abandoned it in favour of the derivation given by Lactantius. He employs the latter meaning in his treatise "On the True Religion", where he says: "Religion binds us [<em>religat</em>] to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">one Almighty God</a>." <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, in his "Summa", II-II, Q. lxxxi, a. 1, gives all three derivations without pronouncing in favour of any. The correct one seems to be that offered by Lactantius. Religion in its simplest form implies the notion of being bound to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the same notion is uppermost in the word religion in its most specific sense, as applied to the life of poverty, chastity, and obedience to which <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> bind themselves by <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> more or less solemn. Hence those who are thus bound are known as religious.

<p>Religion, broadly speaking, means the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> subjection of oneself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It exists in its highest perfection in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, praise, and adore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and live in absolute conformity to His holy will. It does not exist at all in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, where the subordination of <a href="../cathen/12673b.htm">rational</a> creatures to their Creator is one not of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, but of physical necessity. On earth it is practically coextensive with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, though, where it has not been elevated to the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> plane through <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>, it labours under serious defects.

<p>It is with religion as affecting the life of man on earth that this article deals. The analysis of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of religion shows that it is very complex, and rests on several fundamental conceptions. It implies first of all the recognition of a Divine <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> in and behind the forces of nature, the Lord and Ruler of the world, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In the highest religions, this <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> Being is conceived as a spirit, one and indivisible, everywhere present in nature, but distinct from it. In the lower religions, the various phenomena of nature are associated with a number of distinct personalities, though it is rare that among these numerous nature-deities one is not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> as supreme. Ethical qualities corresponding to the prevailing <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> standards, are attributed by the different peoples to their respective <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a>.

<p>In every form of religion is implied the conviction that the mysterious, <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> Being (or beings) has control over the lives and destinies of men. Especially in lower grades of culture, where the nature and utilization of physical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> is but feebly understood, man feels in many ways his helplessness in the presence of the forces of nature: it is the Divine Being that controls them; He it is that can direct them for man's weal or woe. There thus arises in the natural order a sense of dependence on the Deity, deeply felt need of Divine help. This lies at the basis of religion. Still it is not the recognition of dependence on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that constitutes the very essence of religion, indispensable as it is. The damned recognize their dependence on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but, being without hope of Divine help, are turned from, rather than towards, Him. Coupled with the sense of need is the persuasion on the part of man that he can bring himself into friendly, beneficent communion with the Deity or <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> on whom he feels he depends. He is a creature of hope. Feeling his helplessness and need of Divine assistance, pressed down, perhaps, by sickness, loss, and defeat, recognizing that in friendly communion with the Deity he can find aid, peace, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, he is led <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> to perform certain acts of homage meant to bring about this desired result. What man aims at in religion is communion with the Deity, in which he hopes to attain his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and perfection. This perfection is but crudely conceived in lower religions. Conformity to the recognized moral standard, which is generally low, is not wholly neglected, but it is less an object of solicitude than material welfare. The sum of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> looked for is prosperity in the present life and a continuation of the same bodily comforts in the life to come. In the higher religions, the perfection sought in religion becomes more intimately associated with moral <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a>. In <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, the highest of religions, communion with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> implies spiritual perfection of the highest possible kind, the participation in the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> life of grace as the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This spiritual perfection, bringing with it perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, is realized in part at least in the present life of pain and disappointment, but is to be found fully attained in the life to come. The desire of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and perfection is not the only motive that prompts man to do homage to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In the higher religions there is also the sense of <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> arising from the recognition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> sovereignty, and consequently of His strict right to the subjection and worship of man. To this must also be added the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for His own sake, inasmuch as He is the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinitely</a> perfect Being, in whom <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, beauty, and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> are realized in their highest possible degree. While the prevailing motive in all lower religions is one of self-interest, the desire of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, it generally implies to some extent an affectionate as well as reverent attitude towards the <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> that are the object of worship.



<p>From what has been said it is plain that the concept of deity required for religion is that of a free <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of mistaking many nature-deities for the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">one true God</a> vitiates, but does not destroy, religion. But religion ceases to exist where, as in <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, the deity is pronounced to be devoid of all consciousness. A deity without <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> is no more capable of awakening the sense of religion in the heart of man than is the all-pervading ether or the universal force of gravitation. Religion is essentially a personal relation, the relation of the subject and creature, man, to his Lord and Creator, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Religion may thus be defined as the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> subjection of oneself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is to the free, <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> Being (or beings) on whom man is conscious of being dependent, of whose powerful help he feels the need, and in whom he recognizes the source of his perfection and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. It is a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> turning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In the last analysis it is an act of the will. In other words it is a virtue, since it is an act of the will inclining man to observe the right order, springing from his dependence on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (II-II, Q. lxxxi, a. 1) defines religion as "virtus per quam homines Deo debitum cultum et reverentiam exhibent" (the virtue which prompts man to render to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the worship and reverence that is His by right). The end of religion is filial communion with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in which we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and revere Him as our supreme Lord, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him as our Father, and find in that reverent service of filial <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> perfection and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Bliss-giving communion with the sovereign Deity is, as has been pointed out, the end of all religions. Primitive <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a>, with its aim to secure unconscious repose (Nirvana) through personal effort independently of Divine aid, seems to be an exception. But even in primitive <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> communion with the gods of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> was retained as an element of lay <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and aspiration, and it was only by substituting the ideal of Divine communion for that of Nirvana that <a href="../cathen/03028b.htm">Buddhism</a> became a popular religion.

<p>Thus, in its strictest sense, religion on its subjective side is the disposition to acknowledge our dependence on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and on the objective side it is the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> acknowledgement of that dependence through acts of homage. It calls into play not simply the will, but the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, and the emotions. Without the conception of personal deity, religion would not exist. The recognition of the unseen world stirs the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. The emotions, too, are called into exercise. The need of Divine help gives rise to the longing for communion with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The recognized possibility of attaining this end engenders hope. The consciousness of acquired friendship with a protector so good and powerful excites <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. The obtaining of benefits in answer to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> prompts to thankfulness. The immensity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> power and wisdom calls up feelings of awe. The consciousness of having offended and estranged Him, and of thus deserving punishment, leads to fear and sorrow and the desire of reconciliation. Crowning all is the emotion of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> springing from the contemplation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> wonderful <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> and excellence. Hence we see how wide of the mark are the attempts to limit religion to the exercise of a particular faculty, or to identify it with ritual or with <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> conduct. Religion is not adequately described as "the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> acquired by the finite spirit of its essence as absolute spirit" (<a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel</a>), nor as "the perception of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>" (Max Muller), nor as "a determination of man's feeling of absolute dependence" (Schleiermacher), nor as "the recognition of all our <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as divine commands" (<a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant</a>), nor as morality touched by emotion" (Mathew Arnold), nor as "the earnest direction of the emotions and desires towards an ideal object recognized as of the highest excellence and as rightly paramount over selfish objects of desire" (J. S. Mill). These definitions, in so far as they are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, are only partial characterizations of religion.

<p>Religion answers to a deeply felt need in the heart of man. Above the needs of the individual are the needs of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and higher still are the needs of the clan and people. On the welfare of the people depends that of the individual. Hence we find that religion in its outward worship is to a large extent a social function. The chief rites are public rites, performed in the name, and for the benefit, of the whole community. It is by social action that religious worship is maintained and preserved. Only in the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of one's fellow-men does one develop one's <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> and moral faculties, and acquire religion. Religion is distinguished into natural and <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. By natural religion is meant the subjection of oneself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, based on such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of man's moral and religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> as the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> can acquire by its own unaided powers. It does not, however, exclude theophanies and Divine revelations made with the view to confirm religion in the natural order. Supernatural religion implies a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end, gratuitously bestowed on man, namely a lively union with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through <a href="../cathen/06701a.htm">sanctifying grace</a>, begun and imperfectly attained here, but completed in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, where the <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beatific vision of God</a> will be its eternal reward. It also implies a special <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>, through which man comes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this end as well as the Divinely appointed means for its attainment. Subjection of oneself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, based on this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and kept fruitful by grace, is <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> religion.

<h2 id="ii">Subjective religion</h2>

<p>Religion on its subjective side is essentially, but not exclusively, an affair of the will, the will to acknowledge by acts of homage man's dependence on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We have already seen that the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> and the emotions are important factors in subjective religion. The emotions, elicited by the recognition of dependence on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and by the deeply felt need of Divine help, give greater efficacy to the deliberate exercise of the virtue of religion. It is worthy of note that the emotions awakened by the religious consciousness are such as make for a healthy optimism. The predominant tones of religion are those of hope, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, confidence, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, patience, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, the purpose of amendment, and aspiration towards high ideals. All these are the natural accompaniments of the persuasion that through religion man is living in friendly communion with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The view that fear is in most instances the spring of religious action is untenable.

<p>In subjective religion several virtues must be included, most of them being of an emotional character. The proper exercise of the virtue of religion involves three cooperant virtues having <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as their direct object, and hence known as the "theological virtues". First there is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Strictly speaking, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as a virtue is the reverent disposition to submit the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to the Divine, to accept on Divine authority what has been revealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In the wide sense, as applying to all religions, it is the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> acceptance of the fundamental notions of Deity and of man's relation to Deity contained in the religious traditions of the community. In practically all religions there is an exercise of authoritative teaching in regard to the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> basis of religion, the things to be believed. These things <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> do not acquire independently, through direct <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> or discursive reasoning. They come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them from the teaching of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and elders, and from the observance of sacred rites and customs. They take these teachings on authority, made venerable by immemorial usage, so that to reject them would be reprobated as an act of impiety. Thus, while man has the capacity to arrive at a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the fundamentals of religion by the independent exercise of his reason, he regularly comes to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them through the authoritative teaching of his elders. Faith of this kind is practically an indispensable basis of religion. In the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a>, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is absolutely indispensable. If man has been raised to a special <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> end, it is only by revelation that he can come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that end and the Divinely appointed means for its attainment. Such a revelation necessarily implies <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For the exercise of the virtue of religion hope is absolutely indispensable. Hope is the expectation of securing and maintaining bliss-bringing communion with the Deity. In the natural order it rests on the conception of Deity as a morally good <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, inviting confidence. It is also sustained by the recognized instances of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> hope is raised to the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> plane, being based on the promises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made known through the revelation of Christ. The absence of hope paralyzes the virtue of religion. For this reason the damned are no longer capable of religion. Thirdly, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for His own sake is a concomitant of the virtue of religion, being needed for its perfection. In some lower forms of religion, it is largely, if not wholly, absent. The Deity is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> chiefly for the sake of personal advantage. Still, in perhaps the majority of religions, at least the beginnings of a filial affection for the Deity are felt. Such affection seems to be implied in generous offerings and in expressions of thankfulness so common in religious rites. Closely associated with the virtues of hope and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and hence intimately connected with religion as exercised by man in his frailty, is the virtue of repentance. With all his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for religion, man is constantly lapsing into offences against the Deity. These offences, whether ritual or moral, deliberate or involuntary, present themselves as obstacles more or less fatal to the bliss-bringing communion with the Deity which is the end of religion. The fear of forfeiting the good will and help of the Deity, and of incurring His punishment, gives rise to regret, which in higher religions is made more meritorious by the sorrow felt for having offended so good a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence the offender is prompted to acknowledge his fault and to seek reconciliation, so as to restore to its integrity the ruptured union of friendship with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<h2 id="iii">Objective religion</h2>

<p>Objective religion comprises the acts of homage that are the effects of subjective religion, and also the various phenomena which are viewed as the manifestations of good will by the Deity. We may distinguish in objective religion a speculative and a practical part.
<h3 id="A">Speculative</h3>

<p>The speculative part embraces the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> basis of religion, those concepts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man, and of man's relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which are the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whether natural or <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. Of vital importance to right religion are correct views concerning the existence of a personal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> and retribution, the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, and moral responsibility. Hence the need is recognized of firmly establishing the grounds of theistic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, and of refuting the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> that weaken or destroy the virtue of religion. <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">Polytheism</a> vitiates religion, in so far as it confounds the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">one true God</a> with a number of fictitious beings, and distributes among these the reverent service that belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone. Religion is absolutely quenched in <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheism</a>, which tries to substitute for the personal Deity blind physical forces. Equally destructive is <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">Pantheism</a>, which views all things as emanations of an impersonal, unconscious world-ground. <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a>, in declaring that we have not sufficient grounds for asserting the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, also makes religion impossible. Scarcely less fatal is <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deism</a>, which, putting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> far from the visible world, denies <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a> and the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Wherever religion has flourished, we find a deeply rooted <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine providence</a>. Free will &#151; with its <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> implication, moral responsibility &#151; is taken for granted in the creeds of most religions. It is only in grades of higher culture, where philosophic speculation has given occasion to the denial of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, that this important <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is emphasized. Belief in the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is to be found in practically all religions, though the nature of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the character of the future life are in most religions crudely conceived. Divine retribution is also an element of religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> throughout the world. One of the common <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> fostered in recent works on anthropology and the history of religions is that only in the higher religions is moral conduct found to rest on religious sanction. While the standard of right and wrong in lower religions is often grossly defective, allowing the existence of impure and cruel rites, it is nevertheless <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that what is reprobated as morally <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is very generally viewed as an offence against the Deity, entailing punishment in some form unless expiated. Many religions, even those of savage and barbarous tribes, distinguish between the fate of the good and that of the bad after death. The bad go to a place of suffering, or they perish utterly, or they are reborn in vile animal forms. Practically all give evidence of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in retribution in the present life, as may be seen from the universal use of ordeals, <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a>, and the widespread recourse to penitential rites in times of great distress.

<p>These fundamental elements of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> have their legitimate place in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, in which they are found corrected, supplemented, and completed by a larger <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of His purposes in regard to man. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, having destined man for filial communion with Himself in the life of grace, has through the Incarnation and Redemption of Christ brought within the reach of man the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> and practices needed for the attainment of this end. Thus, in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> the things to be believed and the things to be done in order to obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> have the guarantee of Divine authority. Right <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> is thus essential to religion, if man is to do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to his moral and religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> and thereby secure his perfection. The popular cry of today for religion without <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> comes from the failure to recognize the supreme importance of right <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. The dogmatic teachings of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, supplementing and perfecting the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> basis of natural religion, are not to be looked on as a mere series of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> puzzles. They have a practical purpose. They serve to enlighten man on the whole range of his religious and <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, on the proper fulfilment of which depends his <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> perfection. Closely allied with the data of revelation are the attempts to determine their mutual relations, to explain them as far as possible in terms of sound <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and philosophy, and to draw from them their legitimate deductions. Out of this field of religious study has arisen the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. Corresponding with this in function, but the very opposite of it in worth, is the mythology of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> religions. Mythology is the product partly of the tendency of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to realize and partly of man's attempts to account for the origins of such factors in life as fire, disease, death, and to explain the succession of natural phenomena in an age of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> when a fanciful personification of nature's forces occupied the place of scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Hence arose the mythical stories of the gods both great and small, many of which in later generations gave <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> because of their absurdity and immorality. Mythology, being born of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and unbridled fancy, has no legitimate place in sound religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>.
<h3 id="B">Practical</h3>

<p>The practical part comprises (1) the acts of homage whereby man acknowledges <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> dominion and seeks His help and friendship, and (2) the extraordinary religious experiences viewed by the worshippers as manifestations of Divine good will.

<p>(1) The acts of homage may be distinguished into three classes: (a) the direct acts of worship; (b) the regulation of conduct outside the sphere of moral <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>; (c) the regulation of conduct within the recognized sphere of moral <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a>.

<p><em>(a) Acts of Worship.</em> The acts of worship proper consist of those which directly express adoration, thanksgiving, petition, and propitiation. In these are included acts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>, and repentance. They take the external form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and sacrifice. <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Prayer</a>, as an outward act, is the verbal communication of man's thoughts and needs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In the lower religions petitions for earthly favours are the chief objects of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Expressions of thanks, too, are not unknown. Besides these there are in the higher religions <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of adoration, of petition for moral improvement, also penitential <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Sacrifice is equally common with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Scholars are not all agreed as to the primary <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> underlying the use of sacrifice. The most likely view is that sacrifice is primarily a token of respect in the form of a gift. It is often called a gift or offering, even in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/gen004.htm#vrs3">Genesis 4:3-5</a>; <a href="../bible/mat005.htm#vrs23">Matthew 5:23</a>). Among the nations of antiquity, as well as most peoples of today, no inferior would think of approaching his superior without bringing a gift. It is a token of respect and good will. It is not a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a>, as some have objected, though it may degenerate into such. In like manner, man from the earliest times, in doing homage to the Deity, came into His presence with a gift. Besides being a visible <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of man's respect, the gift also signified that all things were <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a>. The giving over of the object to the Deity implied that it no longer belonged to the worshipper, but was made the sacred <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the Deity (<em>sacrificium</em>). Being thus removed from ordinary use, it was passed over to the Deity by a total or partial destruction. Liquid offerings were poured out on the ground. Food offerings were generally burned. Others were cast into rivers or the sea. Very frequently, in the food offerings, only part was destroyed by fire, the rest being eaten by the worshippers. In this way was symbolized the friendly union of the Deity and the worshippers. In some eases the underlying <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> was that man was the privileged guest at the Divine banquet, partaking of the sacred food <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the Deity. It thus had a quasi-sacramental significance. In the ancient Hebrew religion there were food offerings, including bloody <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of animal victims. These were types of the great atoning sacrifice of Christ. In the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, the sacrifice of Christ on the Cross is perpetuated by the unbloody <a href="../cathen/10006a.htm">sacrifice of the Mass</a>, in which the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">eternal Lamb of God</a> is offered under the appearance of <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a> and is devoutly consumed by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and faithful. The use of sacrifice has led to the office of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In the beginning, sacrifice, like <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, was of the simplest kind and was offered by the individual for his personal needs, by the head of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> or clan for its members collectively, and by the chief or king for the whole people.

<p>With the growth of ceremonial <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and rites, the office of sacrifice gave rise to the class of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> whose <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> it was to make the offerings in strict conformity with the complicated ritual. The institution of the office of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is thus later than that of sacrifice. Sacrifices were first made under the open sky on raised hearths of earth or stone, which became altars. For the protection of permanent altars <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> came to be built. The most solemn <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were those offered in behalf of the people for the obtaining of public benefits. To accommodate the large concourse of worshippers, the <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> were often built on a grand scale, surpassing in magnificence the palaces of the kings. From the earliest times religion was thus the great inspiring influence in the development of architecture and the decorative arts. The arts of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a> owe much to the religious use of images and pictures, which from time immemorial have been associated with worship. In acquiring notions of invisible, intangible beings, man has generally made large use of the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, which, while it often misrepresents, serves to concretize and make real the things he recognizes but only vaguely grasps. This has led to the fashioning of forms in wood and stone to represent the mysterious beings to whom man looks for aid. These forms are apt to be repulsive where the art of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a> is rudimentary. In the higher nations of antiquity, the making of sacred images in wood, stone, and metal was carried to a high degree of perfection. Their use degenerated into <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> where <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">Polytheism</a> prevailed. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> has allowed the use of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">paintings</a> to represent the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Incarnate Son of God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and these images are a legitimate aid to devotion, since the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> that is given them is but relative, being directed through them to the beings they represent. It is like the relative <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> given to the flag of the nation. The times and places of external worship deserve passing notice. In most religions we find certain days of the year set apart for the more solemn acts of sacrificial worship: some of these are suggested by recurring phenomena of nature (the new and full moon, spring-time with its awakening vegetation, autumn with its ripened harvests, the two solstices); others commemorate historic events of great importance for the religious life of the people. Hence the widespread observance of religious festivals, when public <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are offered with elaborate ritual and are accompanied with feasting and rest from ordinary business. In like manner certain places, made venerable by immemorial worship or by association with reputed visions, oracles, and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> cures, come to be singled out as the spots most suitable for public worship. Shrines and <a href="../cathen/14495a.htm">temples</a> are built, to which a peculiar <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> attaches, and annual <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrimages</a> are made to them from distant places.

<p>The emotional element in external worship is a feature that cannot be overlooked. The solemn <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to the Deity in behalf of the community are embellished with ritual acts expressive of the emotions brought into play in religious worship. The desire and hope of Divine help, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at its possession, gratitude for favours received, distress at the temporary estrangement of the offended Deity &#151; all these emotions quicken the acts of worship and find expression in chants, instrumental music, dances, processions, and stately ceremonial. These expressions of feeling are also powerful means of arousing feeling, and thus give an intense earnestness to religion. This emotional element enters into the external worship of every religion, but its extent and character vary considerably, being determined by the particular standard of propriety prevailing in a given grade of culture. Uncultured peoples, as a rule, are more emotional and more impulsive in expressing their emotions than are peoples of a high grade of culture. Hence the worship in lower religions is generally characterized by noisy, extravagant action and spectacular display. This is especially shown in their sacred dances, which are for the most part violent, and from our point of view fantastic, but which are executed in a spirit of great earnestness. The early Hebrew religion, like most of the religions of antiquity, had its sacred dances. They are a popular feature of <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islamism</a> today. They have been wisely set aside in <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">Christian worship</a>, though in a very few places, as at <a href="../cathen/05270d.htm">Echternach</a> in <a href="../cathen/09465a.htm">Luxemburg</a>, and in the Seville <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a>, religious dancing gives a local colour to the celebration of certain festivals. Instrumental and vocal music is a most fitting framework for <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and solemn <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. The beginnings of music were necessarily rude. Under the influence of religion, the rhythmic chants grew into inspiring <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and psalms, giving rise to the sacred poetic literature of many nations. In the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> sacred poetry, melody, and polyphonic music have been carried to the height of perfection. Closely allied with the religious dance, yet, when duly circumscribed, not objectionable to refined taste, is the pageantry of religious ceremonial &#151; the employment of numerous officiating <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> dressed in striking costumes to perform a solemn, complicated function, or the religious procession, in which the <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a>, bearing sacred objects, are accompanied by a long line of worshippers, marching to the sound of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> stirring <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and instrumental music. All this makes a profound impression on the spectators. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has shown her wisdom by taking into her liturgy such of these elements as are the legitimate and dignified expression of religious feeling.

<p><em>(b) Regulation of Conduct outside the Sphere of Moral Obligation.</em> This element is common to all religions. It is exemplified in the purifications, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, privation of certain kinds of food, abstinence at times from conjugal intercourse, cessation on certain days from ordinary occupations, mutilations, and self-inflicted pains. Most of these serve as preparations, immediate or remote, for the solemn acts of worship for which ceremonial purity is generally required. Hence many of them are embodied in rites closely associated with Divine worship. Most of these practices rest on a sense of fitness strengthened by immemorial custom. To neglect or disregard them is thought to entail calamities. Thus they have a quasi-religious sanction. In the Hebrew religion practices of this kind rested for the most part on express Divine commands. This was even <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, which, while being a mutilation of a minor sort (the only form of mutilation tolerated in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>), was given a highly moral signification, and made to serve as the token of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> covenant with Abraham and his descendants. The <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> rest, transferred in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> to Sunday, is likewise based on an express Divine command. To this class of external acts of homage belong also the various forms of asceticism that prevail in many religions. Such are the restrictive works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> involving inconvenience, pain, and abstinence from legitimate enjoyments, <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntarily</a> undertaken with the view to merit a larger share of Divine favour and to secure more than ordinary <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and perfection. In the lower religions the ascetic tendency has often degenerated into repulsive forms of <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> based on purely selfish ends. In <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> the various forms of self-denial, particularly the counsels of perfection (poverty, chastity, and obedience) cultivated in the spirit of Divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, have led to the flourishing of the ascetic life within the limits of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religious propriety.

<p><em>(c) Regulation of Conduct within the Recognized Sphere of Moral Obligation.</em> The class of acts which fall within its sphere implies that the sovereign Deity is the guardian of the moral law. Moral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, to the extent that they are recognized, are viewed as Divine commands. Their fulfilment merits Divine approval and reward; their violation entails Divine punishment. Unfortunately the moral standard of peoples in lower grades of culture has been as a rule grossly defective. Many things shocking to our moral sense have been done by them without the consciousness of wrong-doing. Being generally given to incontinence, <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a>, deeds of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and even to cannibalism, they have naturally attributed the same sentiments and practices to their gods. The religious sanction thus conceived lends strength to both the good and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> side of their imperfect standard of conduct. While it helps them to avoid certain gross forms of wrong-doing, patent even to minds of low intelligence, it encourages the continued practice of vicious indulgences that otherwise might be more easily outgrown. This is particularly the case where these excesses have been woven into the myths of the gods and the legends of deified heroes, or have been incorporated into the religious rites and become, as it were, inviolable. This explains how, for example, among peoples so highly civilized as the Babylonians, Greeks, and Romans, certain lascivious rites could hold their own in the <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">sacred liturgy</a>, and also how, in the worship of the <a href="../cathen/02169b.htm">Aztec</a> god of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, human <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> with cannibal feasts could prevail to so shocking a degree. In this respect the religious systems of lower grades of culture have tended to retard reform and progress towards higher standards of conduct. It has been the glory of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">religion of Christ</a> that, starting with the highest <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> principles, it has pointed out to men the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> path to moral and spiritual perfection, and given the most powerful aids to the successful pursuit of this lofty ideal.

<p><em>(2) Manifestations of Divine Good Will</em>

<p>Religion is something more than the attempt of man to secure communion with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is also an experience sometimes real and sometimes fancied, of the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>. Corresponding to the deeply felt need of Divine help is the conviction that in numerous instances this help has been given in answer to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Sensible tokens of Divine good will are piously thought to reward the earnest efforts of man to secure bliss bringing communion with the Deity. Prominent among these are alleged instances of Divine communications to man, revelation.

<p><em>(a) Revelation.</em> Revelation (or <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> speaking to man) is the complement of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> (man speaking to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>). It is instinctively felt to be needed for the perfection of religion, which is a personal relation of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and friendship. There is scarcely a religion which has not its accepted instances of Divine visions and communications. To the Theist this offers a strong presumptive argument in favour of <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">Divine revelation</a>, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would hardly leave this legitimate craving of the human heart unsatisfied. It has, indeed, been fully met in the religion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in which man has been Divinely enlightened in regard to his religious <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>, and has been given the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> power to fulfil them and thereby secure his perfection. In lower religions, where temporal welfare is chiefly kept in view, on the eve of every important undertaking Divine assurance of success is eagerly sought through ritual forms of divination and through the use of prophecy. The office of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, the recognized spokesman of the Deity, is generally but not always distinct from that of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. It had its legitimate place in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Old Law</a>, in which the Divinely chosen Prophets not only told of things to come, but also brought to their contemporaries <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> messages of warning and of moral and spiritual awakening. In <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> the office of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> was perfected and completed for all time. In lower religions the office of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is almost invariably characterized by extraordinary <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> excitement, taken by the worshippers as the sign of the inspiring presence of the Deity. In this state of religious frenzy, brought on as a rule by narcotics, dances, and noisy music, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> utters oracles. Sometimes the prophecy is made after emerging from a trance, in which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is thought to be favoured with Divine visions and communications. In their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, the worshippers mistake these pathological states for the signs of indwelling Deity. Their counterparts may be seen today in the wild scenes of excitement so common in the religious revivals of certain <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, where the believers, under the influence of noisy, soul-stirring exhortations, become seized with religious frenzy, dance, shout, fall into cataleptic fits, and think they see visions and hear Divine assurances of being saved. Quite different from these violent <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> disturbances are the peaceful, but no less extraordinary <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasies</a> of many <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, in which wonderful visions and Divine colloquies are experienced, while the body lies motionless and insensible. The <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character of these experiences is not a matter of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but is vouched for by the careful investigation and judgment of the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> and pronounced worthy of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> acceptance.

<p><em>(b) Extraordinary Healing.</em> There are few religions in which recourse is not had to <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> aid for <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> cures. The testimony of reliable witnesses and the numerous ex-votos that have come down to us from antiquity leave no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the reality of many of these cures. It was natural that they should be viewed as <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> in an age when the remarkable power of suggestion to effect cures was not understood. Modern <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> recognizes that strong <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> impressions can powerfully influence the nervous system and through this the bodily organs, leading in some instances to sudden illness or death, in others to remarkable cures. Such is the so-called mind-cure, or cure by suggestion. It explains naturally many extraordinary cures recorded in the annals of different religions. Still it has its recognized limits. It cannot restore of a sudden a half-decayed organ, or heal instantly a gaping wound caused by a cancer. Yet cures like these and others equally defying natural explanation have taken place at Lourdes and elsewhere, and are authenticated by the highest medical testimony.

<p><em>(c) Sudden Conversions.</em> In the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> there are numerous instances of sudden conversions from a life of vice to one of virtue, from a state of spiritual depression to one of enthusiastic <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. The latter kind are not infrequent in <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> forms of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, where the fear of being outside the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, heightened by lapses into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, leads to spiritual depression and misery with a corresponding yearning for a Divine assurance of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Such conversions, coming unexpectedly and transforming the individual into a new man, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in the consciousness of Divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and active in works of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, have been popularly viewed as <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> in every instance. That many of these conversions may be of a purely natural order seems to be shown by modern <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a>, which offers the plausible theory of the sudden uprush into consciousness of subliminal activities set unconsciously in operation by intense, persistent longings for a change to a better, more spiritual life. But it must be recognized that this theory has its limitations. The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a> may be working in many conversions that allow of a natural explanation. Moreover, there are conversions that defy any such natural explanation as the working of subliminal consciousness. It cannot, for instance, explain the conversion of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, who, from a rabid hater of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, was suddenly turned into one of its most ardent champions, a result that was the very antithesis of his previous conscientious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and aspirations. That his vision of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was real and objective is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the wonderful accession of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that it brought to his mind, fitting him to stand forth unchallenged as one of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">Christ's Apostles</a>. There is no natural explanation for a conversion such as this.
<h3 id="C">Sacred books</h3>

<p>There remains a word to be said, by way of supplement, of the sacred literature characteristic of most higher religions. Both the speculative and the practical side of religion contribute to its formation. Many elements, accumulated through a long series of generations, go to compose the sacred books of the great religions of antiquity &#151; the traditional myths and legends; the stories of the providential dealing of the Deity with His people; the sacred chants, <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; the great epic poems; the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> governing social and domestic activity; the texts of the sacred rites and the prescriptions regulating their exact performance; speculations on the nature of the Deity, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, retribution, and the future life. In some of the ancient religions this enormous mass of sacred lore was transmitted orally from generation to generation till finally it was put in writing. Th every religion possessing sacred books, there is a tendency to give them a much greater antiquity than they actually enjoy, and to view them as the infallible expression of Divine wisdom. This latter claim vanishes quickly when they are compared with the inspired books of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, which in spiritual and literary worth stand immeasurably above them.

<h2 id="iv">The origin of religion</h2>

<p>The beginnings of religion go back to remote prehistoric time. In the absence of positive, historic data, the question of the origin of religion admits only of a speculative answer. It is <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic teaching</a> that primitive religion was a Divinely revealed <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">Monotheism</a>. This was an anticipation and a perfection of the notion of religion, which man from the beginning was naturally capable of acquiring. Religion, like morality, has apart from revelation a natural basis or origin. It is the outcome of the use of reason, though, without the corrective influence of revelation, it is very apt to be misconceived and distorted.
<h3 id="A">Modern application of the principle of causality</h3>

<p>Religion, in its last analysis, rests on a theistic interpretation of nature. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> arrives at this by a process of discursive reasoning, making use of arguments drawn from external nature and from his inner consciousness (see article <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">GOD</a>). This, however, is a highly philosophic process of reasoning, the result of the accumulated contributions of many generations of thinkers. It presupposes a mind trained to abstract reasoning, and hence is by no means easy for the average individual It can hardly have been the method followed by savage man, whose <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> was not trained to philosophy and <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. The process by which he arrived naturally at a theistic interpretation of the world seems to have been a simple, spontaneous application of the principle of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causality</a>.
<h3 id="B">Primitive application of the principle of causality</h3>

<p>There is every reason to think that primitive man's view of nature was, to a large extent, similar to that held by peoples generally who have not risen to a scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of nature. They recognize in all the striking phenomena of earth, air, and sky the immediate agency of intelligent volition. Untutored man does not understand the secondary, mechanical causes of natural events. The cause best known to him are living, personal causes, himself and his fellow-men. Familiarity with lifeless objects, as stocks and stones, weapons and utensils, shows that even these things exhibit only such movement and force as he and his fellows choose to impart to them. Living agency is behind their movements. The natural result is that, whenever he sees a phenomenon showing movement and energy outside his limited experience of mechanical <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causation</a>, he is led spontaneously to attribute it to some mysterious form of living agency. The thunder suggests the thunderer. The sun and moon are taken to be either living things or the instruments of an invisible living agency. Personality is also associated with them, particularly where the phenomena are suggestive of intelligent purpose. To recognize in and behind the phenomena of nature the agency of mind and will was thus easy for primitive man. But it was not an equally simple matter to discern in the great diversity of these phenomena the action of but one supreme <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>. The possibility of such an inference cannot be denied. But its likelihood is not great when we consider how hard it would have been for primitive man in his inexperience to coordinate the varied effects of nature and derive them from one and the same source of power. The more likely tendency would have been to recognize in the diverse phenomena the agency of distinct personalities, as was indeed done by the peoples of antiquity, and as is done today by uncultured peoples everywhere. Peoples, whose <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the physical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of nature has not been compensated by revealed teaching, have invariably personalized the forces of nature, and, feeling that their welfare depended on the beneficent exercise of these powers, have come to divinize them. From this danger of falling into a <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheistic</a> interpretation of nature, primitive man was saved by Divine Revelation. Such, it would seem, was the simple philosophy forming the natural basis of religion in primitive times. It was theoretically capable of leading to a <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">Monotheism</a> like that of the ancient Hebrews, who viewed clouds, rain, lightning, and tempest as the signs of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> immediate activity. But, apart from revelation, it was very liable to degenerate into <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheistic</a> nature-worship. Its defect was primarily scientific, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the secondary causes of natural events; but it rested on a sound principle, namely, that the phenomena ef nature are in some way the outcome of intelligent volition. This principle commends itself to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and scientist.
<h3 id="C">Intuition theory</h3>

<p>Other theories have been suggested to account for the origin of religion. We shall briefly review the more common ones. According to the <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> theory, man has instinctively an <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of his dependence on Him. To this theory there are several serious objections. We ought to be conscious of this <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> if we possessed it. Again, as a result of such <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a>, man should be found everywhere with a <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheistic</a> religion. The widespread existence of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">Polytheism</a> and the religious apathy of many <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> are inconsistent with such an <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.
<h3 id="D">Max Muller's perception theory</h3>

<p>This is but a slight modification of the <a href="../cathen/08082b.htm">intuition</a> theory. Muller thought the perception of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> was the source of religion, being acquired by "a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> faculty which independent of, nay in spite of, sense and reason, enables man to apprehend the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> under different names and under varying disguises" ("Origin and Growth of Religion", London, 1880, p. 23). But apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> or even of the indefinite is suited rather to philosophic than to simple minds, and is not to be found in the generality of religions. It is the apprehension of sovereign <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> that gives rise to religion, not the mere apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. How man arrives at the notion of such <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, this theory does not explain.
<h3 id="E">Fear theory</h3>

<p>A common theory with the Greek and Roman <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, favoured by a few writers of modern times, is that religion had its origin in fear, particularly fear of lightning, tempests, and other dangerous features of nature. But fear is a feeling, and no mere feeling can account for the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a>, which may or may not be associated with a dangerous or terrifying object. Fear, like hope, may be one of the motives prompting man to the worship of the Deity, but such worship presupposes the recognition of Deity, and fear cannot account for this recognition. We have already seen that fear is not the predominating tone even in lower religions, as is shown by the universal use of rites expressing <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, hope, and gratitude.
<h3 id="F">Animist theory</h3>

<p>A favourite theory of modern times is the animist theory. It has been set forth with great erudition by E.B. Tylor. According to this theory, in consequence of a strong tendency to personify, primitive peoples come to view everything as alive, even stocks and stones. They also have a crude notion of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, derived from dreams and Visions experienced in sleep and swoons. Applying this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> to inanimate things, which they take to be alive, they have come to associate mighty spirits with the great phenomena of nature and have given them worship. The defects of this theory are such as to discredit it in the eyes of most scholars. In the first place, it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that uncultured peoples confound the living with the non-living to the extent that they take the very stones to be alive. It would, indeed, be strange if uncultured man were not at least the equal of the beast in ability to distinguish between familiar objects that are lifeless and those that show life and movement. Again, while men of lower grades of culture have a crude notion of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, they do not need that concept to arrive at the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of personal agency in nature. All they need is the notion of personal cause, which they get from the consciousness of themselves as sources of power and purposive action. There is every reason to think that this <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is prior to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> concept. (See <a href="../cathen/01526a.htm">ANIMISM</a>.)
<h3 id="G">Ghost theory</h3>

<p>This theory, whose prominent English champion was Herbert Spencer, identifies the primitive notion of religion with the service and propitiation of departed relatives, and attributes the worship of the great <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> of nature to the mistaken applications of ancestor-worship. The first religious offerings are said to have been offerings of food, weapons, and utensils made to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the dead, whose occupations, needs, and tastes in the next life were thought to be similar to those of earthly existence. In return for this much-needed service, the dead gave the living aid and protection. A series of blunders led to the recognition and worship of the great nature-deities. Migrating peoples from beyond the sea or the mountain became known as children of the sea or of the mountain. Later generations, mistaking the meaning of the term, were led to view the sea or the mountain as their living ancestor and to give it worship. Again, departed heroes named Sun, Thunder, Rain-Cloud, came after a lapse of time to be confounded with the real sun and other natural phenomena, thus giving rise to the conception of nature-deities and to nature-worship. The defects of this theory are manifest. Mistakes like these might be made by some stupid individual of the tribe, but not by all the members of the tribe, still less by tribes over all the earth. A series of trivial and fortuitous blunders cannot account for so world-wide a fact as the recognition of nature-deities. If the ghost-theory were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, we should find the religions of savages consisting exclusively of ancestor-worship. This is not the case. In all lower religions, where we find food-offerings to the dead, we also find recognized, and carefully distinguished from dead heroes, nature <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a>. Among the pygmies of the Northern Congo, accounted one of the lowest of races, there is a reverent recognition of a supreme Deity, but no trace of ancestor-worship. There is thus no good ground for asserting ancestor-worship to have been the earliest form of religion, nor do we need it to account for religion, strictly speaking, in any of its forms. It is a parallel growth that has sprung up and become entwined with religion proper. The latter is of independent origin.
<h3 id="H">Fetish theory</h3>

<p>This derives religion from the use and veneration of fetishes. A fetish is an object (generally small enough to be easily carried) in which a spirit is thought to reside, acting as a protective genius for the owner who wears it, and who venerates it because of its indwelling spirit. Generally, it is the medicine-man or wizard who makes the fetish, and charges it with the spirit. It is used till its inefficiency becomes apparent, when it is cast aside as worthless, in the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> that the indwelling spirit has departed from it. Now the use of such objects cannot be the primary form of religion. In the first place, there is no existing form of religion known in which <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a> is the sole constituent element. Among the <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negroes</a> of West Africa, where it first attracted attention, the fetish spirits are at best but inferior beings, generally distinct from the supreme heaven-god and from the powerful nature-deities associated with the sea and thunder. Again, the notion of persuading spirits to lodge themselves in stocks and stones and become the <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> of the wearers, is the very antithesis of religion, which implies the sense of dependence on the Deity. Far from the latter notion bring derived from the former, there is every reason to see in <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a> a perverted notion of religion. (See <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">FETISHISM</a>.)
<h3 id="I">Totem theory</h3>

<p>This puts the origin of religion in <a href="../cathen/14789a.htm">Totemism</a>, a semi-religious, semi-social institution prevailing chiefly among savage tribes. In certain tribes, every one of the component clans has a tutelary deity intimately associated with a particular species of animal or plant, which species is <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> by the clan as sacred and inviolable. It is called the ancestor of the clan. The <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> of the species are often viewed as particularly sacred because of the indwelling deity. Hence the totem animal or plant is ordinarily not used for food by the clan that bears its name. The union of clans into tribes under the leadership of one superior clan is said to have led to the absorption of the weaker totem <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> into that of the ruling clan, with the result that powerful tribal <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> arose. It was but a step further to the recognition of a supreme deity. <a href="../cathen/14789a.htm">Totemism</a> labours under many of the difficulties of <a href="../cathen/06052b.htm">Fetishism</a>. Nowhere do we find religion of pure <a href="../cathen/14789a.htm">Totemism</a>. Among the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">North American Indians</a>, where <a href="../cathen/14789a.htm">Totemism</a> has flourished with the greatest vigour, the totems are absolutely overshadowed by the great <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> of the sky, air, and water. The distinction between them and the totem spirits is absolute. Nowhere do the great <a href="../cathen/04683a.htm">deities</a> bear the names of animals or plants as a mark of totem origin. In the majority of the religions of the world, there is no trace of <a href="../cathen/14789a.htm">Totemism</a>, vestiges of which ought to be widespread if it had been the source of all other forms of religion. The totem, Iike the fetish, presupposes the very thing that needs to be accounted for, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the existence of unseen personal agents.

<h2 id="v">The universality of religion</h2>
<h3 id="A">Historical survey</h3>

<p>From what has already been said, it is plain that religion, though often imperfectly conceived, is in normal conditions of human existence the inevitable outcome of the use of reason. It is but natural, then, that religion, at least in some crude form, should be a characteristic feature in the life of all peoples. This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was widely questioned during the last few centuries, when the extension of travel to unexplored lands gave rise to reports asserting the absence of religion among many native tribes of <a href="../cathen/01777b.htm">Asia</a>, <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, America, and the islands of the Pacific Ocean. One by one these reports have been nullified by the contrary statements of travellers and missionaries better qualified as witnesses, so that today there remain but very few peoples of whom it cannot be said with <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> that they possess some form, however degraded, of religion. These rare exceptions do but prove the rule, for they are insignificant tribes which, in the struggle for existence, have been driven by their enemies to inhospitable regions where the conditions of life are so wretched as to cause them to degenerate almost to a state of brutalization. A degradation of this sort can prove fatal to the sentiment of religion. A notable instance is the <a href="../cathen/07747a.htm">Indian</a> tribe in Southern <a href="../cathen/03170a.htm">California</a> among whom <a href="../cathen/02201b.htm">Father Baegert</a>, a <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> missionary, laboured for many years. In the account which he gave of his experiences, a translation of which was published in the "Smithsonian Report" of 1864, he testified to their stupidity and utter lack of religion. Yet their descent from Indian stocks that had well defined religious notions is practically certain. <a href="../cathen/02201b.htm">Father Baegert</a> observed a few vestiges of an ancestral <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in a future life for example the custom of putting sandals on the feet of the dead, the significance of which the Indians could not explain. Mental degradation like this may thus involve the loss of religion. But such degradation is extremely rare. On the other hand, wherever tribes exist in normal conditions, they are found to possess some sort of religion. The <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erroneous</a> reports of earlier travellers asserting a lack of religion where religion actually exists, have been due either to superficial observation or to a misunderstanding as to what should be called religion. Some have accepted as religion only an exalted notion of the Deity coupled with well-organized rites of public worship. The absence of these has often been set down as an absence of religion. Again, unfavourable verdicts have not infrequently been based on a stay of but one or two days with tribes speaking an unknown tongue, as for example was the case with <a href="../cathen/15364a.htm">Verrazano</a> and <a href="../cathen/15384b.htm">Amerigo Vespucci</a>. But, even where observers have stayed for months among rude peoples, they have sometimes found it extremely difficult to obtain information in regard to religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and practices; a suspicion that the white man was seeking to obtain some advantage over them has more than once led savages to resort to deceit to conceal their religion. It is the calm, impartial judgment of anthropologists today that there is no people of note that is absolutely devoid of religion.
<h3 id="B">Outlook</h3>

<p>But the further question may be asked: If religion has been universal in the past, have we any assurance that it will persist in time to come? Has not the advance of modern <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> been marked by a progressive substitution of mechanical for personal agency in nature, with the inevitable result, as a writer has expressed it, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will one day be bowed out of His <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> as no longer needed? To this we may reply: The advance of modern scientific culture is fatal to all <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheistic</a> forms of religion, in which the recognized secondary causes are, through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, mistaken for personal causes. The well-established scientific <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the unity of nature's forces is in harmony only with the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">monotheistic</a> interpretation of nature. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">Monotheism</a>, far from being inconsistent with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>, is <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to supplement and complete the limited interpretation of nature afforded by <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. The latter, being based on observation and experiment, has for its legitimate sphere of study only secondary causes of nature. It can tell nothing of origins, nothing of the great First Cause, from which the orderly <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> has proceeded. In substituting physical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for what was formerly thought to be the direct action of Divine agency, it has not accounted for the intelligent, purposive direction of nature. It has simply pushed the question somewhat further back, but left it with its religious answer as importunate as ever. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that in modern civilized nations there has asserted itself a notable tendency to religious scepticism and indifference. It is a symptom of unrest, of an unhealthy, excessive reaction from the simple view of nature that prevailed in both <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and religion in former times. In the material order, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the natural causes of lightning, tempests, comets, earthquakes, droughts, and pests, has led less cultured peoples to see direct <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> agency in their production. For them nature in its seemingly capricious moods has had the aspect rather of master than of servant. Their sense of dependence has thus been keen and constant; their need of Divine help urgent to a high degree. On the other hand, the widespread recognition among cultured peoples of the reign of law leads man to seek natural remedies in times of distress, and only where these fail to turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for aid. Modern civilization, in removing many scourges of ancient times that were viewed as <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, in greatly lessening the range of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a>, in binding nature in a thousand ways to beneficent service, has tended to create in the heart of man a feeling of self-sufficiency that tends to enfeeble the virtue of religion. That this tendency, however, is an abnormal, passing distemper rather than a permanent, characteristic feature of modern civilizations, may be seen from the unshaken <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of many of the greatest exponents of scientific culture (e.g. Clerk-Maxwell, Sir John Herschell, Lord Kelvin in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>; Faye, <a href="../cathen/08799a.htm">Lapparent</a>, <a href="../cathen/11536a.htm">Pasteur</a> in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>). It is still more strikingly shown by the conversion from scepticism to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of distinguished scholars such as <a href="../cathen/09295b.htm">Littr&eacute;</a>, Romanes, <a href="../cathen/03010a.htm">Bruneti&egrave;re</a>, Bourget, Copp&eacute;e, and von Ruville. It was recognized by these and other profound thinkers that the deeply seated craving in the human heart for bliss-giving communion with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can never be stilled by <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> or by any other proposed substitute for religion.

<h2 id="vi">The civilizing influence of religion</h2>

<p>Religion in its highest forms has exercised a profound influence on the development of human culture. In the recognized sphere of morality, it has offered powerful motives to right conduct; it has been the chief inspiration of music, poetry, architecture, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculpture</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11395a.htm">painting</a>; it has been the dominant influence in the formation of a permanent literature. In all the early civilizations, the chief representatives and transmitters of the highest known culture have been the officials in charge of religious rites. Religion has been a mighty force in the life of nations, cultivating in the hearts of men a striving for better things, a healthy tone of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">cheerfulness</a>, hope, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, resignation under calamities, perseverance in the face of difficulties, a readiness for generous service, in short a spirit of highminded optimism, without which no nation can rise to greatness. Most noteworthy has been the influence of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> in transforming and elevating <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Its lofty <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> teachings, the peerless example of its Divine Founder, the fundamental principle that we are all children of the same heavenly Father and hence bound to treat our fellow-men not only with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> but with mercy and charity, the spirit of generous, self-sacrificing service, springing from personal devotion to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Divine Saviour</a> and prompting to the practice of <a href="../cathen/07292c.htm">heroic virtues</a> &#151; all this, having for its end the spiritual perfection of the individual and the union of all men through a common bond of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and worship in a Divinely constituted Church, has exercised a mighty influence in softening and refining the rude peoples of early <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, in breaking down the barriers of race prejudice, and in forming common <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> of many nations, in which the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> recognized, though not yet fully attained, is a universal reign of peace, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, chastity, charity reverence for authority, sympathy for the afflicted, a general diffusion of useful <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and in short a common participation in everything that makes for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> culture. Nowhere have the <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a> flourished in such variety and vigour as in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> lands. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> has ever been the great conservative force, favouring established order and law, and opposed to hasty innovations calculated to cause a profound disturbance in existing religious or political institutions. The value of such a force in human affairs is incalculable, even though it may occasionally retard for a while the general recognition of some principle of permanent value in <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> economics, or politics.

<p>While, in modern civilization, state institutions are sharing with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07480a.htm">hospitals</a>, asylums, and <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> the work of charitable ministration which in former times depended exclusively on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> while the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> and arts no longer need the fostering influence of religion, it is nevertheless <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that, in the social and moral order, the need of right religion is as urgent as ever. It has not ceased to be the mighty social power working for the <a href="../cathen/06640a.htm">highest good</a> of the nation. Religion alone can keep alive in a people devotion to high ideals, respect for established authority, preference for peaceful measures to secure political and industrial reforms, and a cheerful spirit of perseverance despite powerful opposition. Religion means generous optimism; irreligion means sordid pessimism. It is religion, too, that presents the highest and most efficacious motives for the upbuilding of character in the individual, for the conscientious fulfilment of his moral <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> does not disdain the purely secular grounds of morality, such as the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of virtue and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of vice, self-respect, regard for public opinion, fear of legal sanctions; but it reinforces and completes these by the powerful motives that are the fruit of the teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the greatest <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> teacher the world has ever seen &#151; <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, personal devotion to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the sense of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> presence, and the thought of Divine retribution. These motives, supernaturalized by grace, exercise a powerful influence in developing an interior conformity to the rule of right conduct, which distinguishes genuine moral worth from the mere outward show of respectability. Right religion both indicates and makes possible of fulfilment man's <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> to himself, his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, his neighbour, and the State. In the measure that he conforms to the teaching of religion will he be found to be a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> promoter and observer of civic <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. In short, wherever we find the practical observance of right religion, there we find social order to a high degree. The nation that designedly and systematically repudiates religion is depriving itself of the most powerful factor operative in the upbuilding and maintaining of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> public welfare. It is on the steep incline to social and political ruin.

<h2 id="vii">The modern scientific study of religion</h2>

<p>Modern scholarship has given much attention to the study of religion. Out of this many-sided study have grown the modern branches known as the history of religion, comparative religion, and the <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> of religion, all of which are supplemented and completed by the older discipline, the philosophy of religion.
<h3 id="A">History of religion</h3>

<p>This has for its scope the accurate and systematic exposition of the positive data that go to make up the different external religions of the world &#151; the rites, customs, restrictions, concepts of deity, sacred books, etc. Its point of view is purely historic. It studies each religion apart from the question of its spiritual worth and possible <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> origin, simply as an external expression of religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. A sympathetic interest attaches to this study, for there are few religions, however crude, that do not represent the sincere effort of man to bring himself into communion with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The work accomplished in this field has been immense. Religious data have been accumulated from hundreds of different sources, and the sacred books of the great Oriental religions have been carefully translated, so that today there is within easy reach of the scholar a very reliable survey of the chief religions of the world.
<h3 id="B">Comparative religion</h3>

<p>Closely allied to the history of religions, out of which it has grown, is comparative religion. The scope of this discipline is the comparative study of the many elements common to different religions with the view to ascertain their underlying thought and purpose, and thus to discover if possible the causes of their genesis and persistence. In some instances, where resemblances of a striking kind are found in two or more religions, it seeks to determine whether these resemblances imply dependence. It also admits a more extensive comparison of religion with religion in order to estimate their relative value. But like the history of religions, the data of which it uses, it does not concern itself as a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> with the question whether any given religion be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Comparative religion has helped to a better understanding of many phases of external religion, It has shown how certain widespread rites and customs have been the natural product of human thought in lower grades of culture. It has enabled us to recognize in higher religions elements that are survivals of earlier stages of thought. But its principles of comparison have to be used with great care, for they can easily be made to do service for contradictory and visionary theories. The writings of authors such as Frazer and Reinach offer many examples of unwarranted conclusions supported by far-fetched comparisons.
<h3 id="C">Psychology of religion</h3>

<p>This discipline studies the different psychical states implied in, and associated with, the religious consciousness. It concerns itself with the extraordinary and abnormal, as well as with the normal exercise of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a>, volitional, emotional, and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imaginative</a> activities set in motion by religion. It does not attempt to vindicate the <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> character of these psychical experiences or to show their conformity to objective <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Viewing them simply as <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> states, it seeks to find out how far they may be explained by natural causes. In the short period of its existence it has given much consideration to the phenomena of sudden conversions, religious frenzy, the sense of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> presence experienced by <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and the extraordinary experiences of mystics, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and non-Catholic. In seeking the natural explanation of some of these experiences it has been successful; but, as has already been pointed out, it has its limitations.
<h3 id="D">Philosophy of religion</h3>

<p>The philosophy of religion is the crown and completion of the several disciplines already mentioned. It carries the inquiring mind beyond the sphere of natural <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">causation</a> to the recognition of the great personal First Cause and Source of all things, and shows that only in the recognition of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a satisfactory interpretation of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> attainable. It is the <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> which examines the value of religion, and investigates with careful scrutiny the grounds of theistic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. In its method of procedure and choice of arguments, it shows considerable variation, due in large measure to the different theories of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that obtain in the world of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>. Since <a href="../cathen/08603a.htm">Kant's</a> criticism of the <a href="../cathen/13548a.htm">Scholastic</a> arguments for the <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">existence of God</a>, there has been a strong tendency in many <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> to neglect the <a href="../cathen/04413a.htm">cosmological</a> and teleological arguments, and to see the evidence of Divine wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">goodness</a> rather in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> than in external nature. A reaction is now setting in. Some of the leading exponents of biological science now recognize that evolution, as an adequate explanation of the variety of organic life, is necessarily teleological, and do not hesitate to declare that the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is the manifestation of a creative, controlling mind.
