<h1>Religious Congregations of the Holy Ghost</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">The Congregation of the Holy Ghost and of the Immaculate Heart of Mary</h2>

<p>This Congregation was founded on Whit Sunday, 1703, for the purpose of preparing missionaries for the most abandoned <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, whether in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> countries. Its founder was a young, holy ecclesiastic of noble Breton birth and of brilliant talents, Claude-Fran&ccedil;ois Poullart des Places, who, three years previously, in the twenty-first year of his age, had given up the bright prospects of a parliamentary lawyer to embrace the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastical state</a>. From the very beginning of his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> studies he manifested a particular attraction for lowly and neglected <a href="../cathen/03592a.htm">works of charity</a>. He became especially interested in poor, deserving students, on whom he freely spent all his own private means and as much as he could collect from his friends. It was with a dozen of these gathered round him that he opened the Seminary of the Holy Ghost, which afterwards developed into a religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. The work grew rapidly; but the labours and anxieties connected with the foundation proved too much for the frail health of the founder. He died on 2 October, 1709, in the thirty-first year of his age, and in only the third of his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. The portraits which remain of Father Poullart des Places depict a distinguished and intelligent countenance, combining energy with sweetness.

<p>After the founder's death, the Congregation of the Holy Ghost continued to progress; it became fully organized, and received the <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> of the civil and <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a>. It sent missionaries to the French colonies, and to <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">China</a>, but suffered much from the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a>, and, when that scourge had passed away, only one member, Father Berout, remained. He had survived <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculously</a>, as it were, all manner of vicissitudes &mdash; shipwreck on the way to his destined mission in French Guiana, enslavement by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moors</a>, a sojourn in Senegal, where he had been sold to the English, who then ruled there. On his return to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, after peace was restored to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he re-established the congregation, and continued its work. But it was found impossible to recover adequately from the disastrous effects of the dispersion caused by the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>, and the restored <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> was threatened with extinction. It was at this juncture that there came to its relief <a href="../cathen/09223a.htm">Father Libermann</a>, and his fellow-missionaries of the Society of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, which he had founded in 1842. Since the object of both <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> was the same, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> requested the founder of the new <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> to engraft it on the older Congregation of the Holy Ghost. This was done in 1848. <a href="../cathen/09223a.htm">Ven. Francis Mary Libermann</a> was made first superior general of the united <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a>, and the whole body became so impregnated with his spirit and that of his first followers that he is rightly regarded as the chief father and founder of the Congregation of the Holy Ghost and of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, such as it exists today.

<p>The first care of the new superior general was to organize on a solid basis the religious service of the old French colonies, by securing the establishment of <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">bishoprics</a> and making provisions for the supply of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> through the Seminary of the Holy Ghost, which was continued on the lines of its original purpose &mdash; to serve as a colonial <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> for the French colonies. But the new superior general set himself to cultivate still wider fields of missionary enterprise. There had already been opened to him the vast domain of <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, which he was, practically, the first to enter, and which was to be henceforth the chief field of labour of his disciples. It is a fact to be noted that the taking-up of the African missions by <a href="../cathen/09223a.htm">Ven. Francis Mary Libermann</a> was due to the initiative of two American <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a>, under the encouragement of the first Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>. Already, in 1833, <a href="../cathen/05470a.htm">Dr. England</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03630a.htm">Charleston</a>, had drawn the attention of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> to the activity of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> on the West Coast of Africa, and had urged the sending of missioners to those benighted regions. This appeal was renewed at the Council of <a href="../cathen/02228a.htm">Baltimore</a>, and the Fathers there assembled commissioned the <a href="../cathen/16007a.htm">Rev. Dr. Barron</a>, who was then <a href="../cathen/15402a.htm">Vicar-General</a> of Philadelphia, to undertake the work at Cape Palmas. That <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> went over the ground carefully for a few years, and then repaired to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to give an account of the work, and to receive further instructions. He was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and appointed Vicar-Apostolic of the Two Guineas. But, as he had only one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and a catechist at his disposal, he repaired to <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to search for missioners. <a href="../cathen/09223a.htm">Ven. Francis Mary Libermann</a> supplied him at once with seven <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and three coadjutor brothers. The deadly climate played havoc with the inexperienced <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the first missionaries. All but one perished in the course of a few months, and <a href="../cathen/16007a.htm">Dr. Barron</a> returned in despair to America, where he devoted himself to missionary work. He died from the effects of his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> during the yellow-fever epidemic in <a href="../cathen/13488a.htm">Savannah</a>, in 1853, in the fifty-third year of his age. <a href="../cathen/09223a.htm">Father Libermann</a> and his disciples retained the African mission; new missionaries volunteered to go out and take the places of those who had perished; and gradually there began to be built up the series of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> communities in darkest Africa which form the distinctive work of the Congregation of the Holy Ghost. It has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a work of continued sacrifice. Nearly 700 missionaries have laid down their lives in Africa during the past sixty years. Still, the spiritual results have compensated for it all. Where there was not a single <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> among the thirty millions of people who inhabit the districts confided to the Holy Ghost Fathers, there are today some hundred thousand solid, well-instructed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. These <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are spread over the Diocese of <a href="../cathen/01512b.htm">Angola</a> and the eight Vicariates of Senegambia, <a href="../cathen/13783a.htm">Sierra Leone</a>, Gaboon, Ubangi (or French Upper Congo), Loango (or French Lower Congo), on the West Coast; and Northern Madagascar, <a href="../cathen/15750c.htm">Zanzibar</a>, Bagamoyo, on the East Coast. There are, moreover, the Prefectures of Lower <a href="../cathen/11073c.htm">Nigeria</a>, French Guinea, Lower Congo (Landana), and missions at Bata, in Spanish West Africa, and at Kindou, in the Congo Independent State.

<p>Besides the missions in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>, the Congregation of the Holy Ghost has missions in Mauritius, R&eacute;union, the Rodriguez Islands, Trinidad, <a href="../cathen/09731a.htm">Martinique</a>, <a href="../cathen/07044a.htm">Guadeloupe</a>, <a href="../cathen/07114a.htm">Haiti</a>, and Amazonia. Moreover, the congregation conducts some very important <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">educational institutions</a>, such as the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the colonial <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminary</a> at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, the colleges of Blackrock, Rockwell, and Rathmines in <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, St. Mary's College in Trinidad, the Holy Ghost College of <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/11638c.htm">Pennsylvania</a>, and the three colleges of <a href="../cathen/02728a.htm">Braga</a>, <a href="../cathen/11260a.htm">Oporto</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09281a.htm">Lisbon</a> in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>. The congregation is organized into the following provinces: <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/08098b.htm">Ireland</a>, <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>. These several provinces, as well as all the foreign missions, are under the central control of a superior general, who resides in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, and who is aided by two assistants and four consultors &mdash; all chosen by the general chapter of the congregation. The whole <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> is under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the Cardinal Prefect of the <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>. Recently, houses have been opened in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/03227a.htm">Canada</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, and it is hoped that they will develop into distinct provinces at no distant date, so as to supply the colonies of these respective countries with an increase of missionaries. The province of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> was founded in the year 1873. It comprises today 74 professed fathers, 19 professed scholastics, 30 professed coadjutor brothers. It is equipped with a <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> and senior scholasticate, at Ferndale, in the <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Diocese of Hartford</a>, an apostolic college at Cornwells, near Philadelphia. The main object of these institutions is to train missionaries for the most abandoned <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, especially for the coloured people. The province has already established two missions for the coloured race, one in Philadelphia, the other at Rock Castle, near Richmond. Others will be established as quickly as missionaries are formed. Moreover, missions for various nationalities have been established in the following <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, at the urgent request of the respective <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>: Little Rock, <a href="../cathen/12121a.htm">Pittsburg</a>, <a href="../cathen/04758b.htm">Detroit</a>, <a href="../cathen/06726a.htm">Grand Rapids</a>, <a href="../cathen/08735b.htm">La Crosse</a>, Philadelphia, <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Providence</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07143a.htm">Harrisburg</a>. In all there are twenty-three houses.

<p>The latest statistics for the entire congregation, published in April, 1908, give 195 communities, 722 fathers, 210 professed scholastics, 655 professed brothers, 230 <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, 595 aspirants. About half the professed members are engaged in the African missions. The congregation is slowly but steadily forming a native <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and sisterhood in <a href="../cathen/01181a.htm">Africa</a>. A dozen <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and about one hundred <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> sisters are at present working in the several missions.
<h2 id="section2">Congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Ghost</h2>

<p>This congregation was founded in Brittany, in the year 1706, by two <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> ladies, Ren&eacute;e Burel and Marie Balavenne, under the direction of a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> missionary, Father Leuduger. Its principal object is the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of children; but it also undertakes all kinds of charitable work. The congregation developed rapidly, and the "White Sisters", as its members were called, from the colour of their habit, became very numerous all over the north-west of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. It suffered the fate of all religious <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> at the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a>; but it quickly recovered, and increased a hundredfold during the course of the nineteenth century. The iniquitous French anti-congregation legislation of 1902 has <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">caused</a> the congregation to disperse. While still in possession at its mother-house at <a href="../cathen/13340a.htm">Saint-Brieuc</a>, in Brittany, and in several other of its houses in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, in the face of bitter <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, several hundreds of the Sisters of the Holy Ghost have gone to <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. The late Bishop Tierney invited them to his <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Diocese of Hartford</a> in 1902, and from there they have already spread to <a href="../cathen/14236c.htm">Springfield</a>, <a href="../cathen/12509a.htm">Providence</a>, <a href="../cathen/05771a.htm">Fall River</a>, <a href="../cathen/03081b.htm">Burlington</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11222a.htm">Ogdensburg</a>. There are 22 houses at present in these several <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> and over 200 sisters. The provincial house is at <a href="../cathen/07144a.htm">Hartford</a>.
<h2 id="section3">Sisters of the Holy Ghost (Dubuque)</h2>

<p>This congregation was founded in 1890, by the late Most Rev. John Hennessey, <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/05179b.htm">Dubuque</a>. Its object is twofold, the cultivation of devotion to <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">God the Holy Ghost</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of youth. The mother-house is in St. Anthony's parish, West Dubuque, <a href="../cathen/08093b.htm">Iowa</a>.
<h2 id="section4">Sister-Servants of the Holy Ghost</h2>

<p>This congregation was founded at Steyl, <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, in 1889, by the late <a href="../cathen/16047a.htm">Very Rev. Father Janssen</a>, as auxiliary to his other foundation, the Society of the Divine Word. It was introduced into the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> in 1901, and has a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> at Techny, <a href="../cathen/07653a.htm">Illinois</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> for <a href="../cathen/12627a.htm">negro</a> children at Vicksburg, Mississippi.
<h2 id="section5">Sisters of the Holy Ghost (for Coloured People)</h2>

<p>This congregation was first established in 1886 at <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a>, <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>. So far, it has only two houses, one at <a href="../cathen/13424b.htm">San Antonio</a>, and the other at Victoria, <a href="../cathen/14543a.htm">Texas</a>.
