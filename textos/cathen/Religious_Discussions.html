<h1>Religious Discussions</h1>  

<p>(CONFERENCES, DISPUTATIONS, DEBATES)

<p>Religious discussions, as contradistinguished from polemical writings, designate oral dialectical duels, more or less formal and public, between champions of divergent religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>. For the most part, the more celebrated of these discussions have been held at the instigation of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has rarely shown favour to this method of ventilating <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. This attitude of opposition on the part of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is wise and intelligible. A champion of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, possessed of all the qualifications essential to a public debater, is not easily to be found. Moreover, it seems highly improper to give the antagonists of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> an opportunity to assail mysteries and institutions which should be spoken of with reverence. The fact that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party to the controversy is nearly always <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to be on the defensive places him at a disadvantage before the public, who, as Demosthenes remarks, "listen eagerly to revilings and accusations". At any rate, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as custodian of Revelation, cannot abdicate her office and permit a jury of more or less competent individuals to decide upon the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> committed to her care.

<p><a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> (II-II, Q. x, a. 7) holds that it is lawful to dispute publicly with unbelievers, under certain conditions. To discuss as doubting the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; to discuss for the purpose of refuting <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, is praiseworthy. At the same time the character of the audience must be considered. If they are well instructed and firm in their <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, there is no danger; if they are simple-minded then, where they are solicited by unbelievers to abandon their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, a public defence is needful, provided it can be undertaken by competent parties. But where the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> are not exposed to such perverting influences, discussions of the sort are dangerous. It is not, then, surprising that the question of disputations with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> has been made the subject of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> legislation. By a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/01287b.htm">Alexander IV</a> (1254-1261) inserted in "Sextus Decretalium", Lib. V, c. ii, and still in force, all <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> are forbidden, under threat of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, to dispute publicly or privately with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. The text reads: "Inhibemus quoque, ne cuiquam laic&aelig; person&aelig; liceat publice vel privatim de fide catholic&acirc; disputare. Qui vero contra fecerit, excommunicationis laqueo innodetur." (We furthermore forbid any lay <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to engage in dispute, either private or public, concerning the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. Whosoever shall act contrary to this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, let him be bound in the fetters of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>.) This law, like all <a href="../cathen/11611c.htm">penal laws</a>, must be very narrowly construed. The terms <em><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a></em> and <em>dispute</em> have a technical signification. The former term refers to questions purely <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>; the latter to disputations more or less formal, and engrossing the attention of the public. There are numerous questions, somewhat connected with <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a>, which many <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> who have received no scientific <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> training can treat more intelligently than a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. In modern life, it frequently happens that an O'Connell or a <a href="../cathen/10513b.htm">Montalembert</a> must stand forward as a defender of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> interests upon occasions when a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theologian</a> would be out of place. But when there is a question of dogmatic or <a href="../cathen/14601a.htm">moral theology</a>, every intelligent <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> will concede the propriety of leaving the exposition and defence of it to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>.

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are not free to engage in public disputes on religion without due authorization. In the Collectanea S. Cong. de Prop. Fide" (p. 102, n. 294) we find the following <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a>, issued 8 March, 1625: "The Sacred Congregation has ordered that public discussions shall not be held with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, because for the most part, either owing to their loquacity or audacity or to the applause of the audience, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> prevails and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is crushed. But should it happen that such a discussion is unavoidable, notice must first be given to the S. Congregation, which, after weighing the circumstances of time and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, will prescribe in detail what is to be done. The Sacred Congregation enforced this <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> with such vigour, that the custom of holding public disputes with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> wellnigh fell into desuetude. [See the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of 1631 regarding the missionaries in Constantinople; also the decrees of 1645 and 1662, the latter forbidding the General of the <a href="../cathen/03320b.htm">Capuchins</a> to authorize such disputes (Collectanea, 1674, n. 302).]

<p>That this <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">legislation</a> is still in force appears from the letter addressed to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> by Cardinal Rampolla in the name of the Cong. for Ecclesiastical Affairs (27 Jan., 1902) in which it is declared that discussions with Socialists are subject to the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> regarding public disputes with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; and, in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a>, 7 Feb., 1645, such public disputations are not to be permitted unless there is hope of producing greater good and unless the conditions prescribed by <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> are fulfilled. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, it is added, considering that these discussions often produce no result at all or even result in harm, has frequently forbidden them and ordered <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> superiors to prevent them; where this cannot be done, care must be taken that the discussions are not held without the authorization of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>; and that only those who are well qualified to secure the triumph of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian truth</a> shall take part therein. It is evident, then, that no <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is ever permitted to become the aggressor or to issue a challenge to such a debate. If he receives from the other party to the controversy a public challenge under circumstances which make a non-acceptance appear morally impossible, he must refer the case to his canonical superiors and be guided by their counsel. We thus reconcile two apparently contradictory utterances of the Apostles: for according to St. Peter (<a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#vrs15">1 Peter 3:15</a>) you should be "ready always to satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of that <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> which is in you", while <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> admonishes Timothy (<a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#vrs14">2 Timothy 2:14</a>), "Contend not in words, for it is to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers".
<h2>Historic disputations in early times</h2>

<p>The disputes of St. Stephen and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>, mentioned in the <a href="../bible/act000.htm">Acts of the Apostles</a>, were rather in the nature of Apostolic pleading than of formal discussions. <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin's</a> "Dialogue with Tryphon" was, in all probability, a literary effort after the model of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> dialogues. St. Augustine, the ablest disputant of all time, engaged in several set debates with <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a>. An interesting summary of each of these great disputations is preserved among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saint's</a> works, and ought to be closely studied by those who are called to defend the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> cause. Of particular interest is the celebrated <a href="../cathen/01199a.htm">Conference of Carthage</a>, convened by order of <a href="../cathen/07460a.htm">Emperor Honorius</a> to finish the inveterate <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>. It opened 1 June, 411, and lasted three days. The tribune Marcellinus represented the emperor, and in the presence of 286 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and 279 <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, St. Augustine, as chief spokesman of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, so completely upset the sectarian arguments, that the victory was awarded to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, many prominent members of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> were converted, and <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatism</a> was doomed to a lingering death. Another memorable disputation took place in Africa a couple of centuries later (645) between St. Maximus, <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">Abbot</a> of <a href="../cathen/03743a.htm">Chrysopolis</a> (Scutari) and the <a href="../cathen/10502a.htm">Monothelite</a> Patriarch Pyrrhus, who had been driven from Constantinople by popular <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. It was conducted with rare skill and ended with the temporary conversion of Pyrrhus to the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.


<h2>During the Reformation period</h2>

<p>At the outbreak of the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> and <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwinglian</a> revolution, tumultuous discussions of religious subjects grew to be epidemic. <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> opened the revolt by inviting discussion upon his ninety-five theses, 31 Oct., 1517. Although ostensibly framed to furnish matter for an ordinary scholastic dispute, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> did not seriously contemplate an oral debate; for several of his theses were at variance with <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> and could not be discussed at a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a>. Instead, they were widely scattered through <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>, everywhere creating confusion. An opportunity of disseminating more openly his peculiar tenets regarding <a href="../cathen/08573a.htm">justification</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, the slavery of the human will, and the sinfulness of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a> was offered to the Reformer by his order during a convention held at <a href="../cathen/07196a.htm">Heidelberg</a> in April, 1518, when he directed a dispute on twenty-eight <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> and forty <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> theses in the presence of many professors, students, citizens, and courtiers. Though his novel tenets were viewed with deep displeasure by the older heads, he was successful in winning over several of his younger hearers, notably Brenz and the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a>, Martin <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer</a>. Emboldened by the outcome of the Heidelberg Dispute, and having discovered that the road to success lay in captivating the young, the agitator made futile attempts at organizing disputations at the seats of higher learning; but no <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> would lend its halls to the dissemination of un-Catholic doctrines.

<p>The imprudence of <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Dr. Eck</a>, who had become involved in a literary contest with Carlstadt and had hastily challenged his adversary to a public debate, gave <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> his long-looked-for opportunity. With his customary energy, he took the direction of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> duel, encouraged both antagonists to persevere, and arranged the details. The city of Leipzig was chosen as the scene. Although the faculty of the <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">university</a> entered a vigorous protest, and the Bishops of Merseburg and Brandenburg launched prohibitions and an <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, the disputation took place under the &aelig;gis of Duke George of Saxony. The discontent of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> was increased when they learned that <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> had secured permission to subjoin a controversy with <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Eck</a> on the subject of <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> supremacy. <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Eck</a> came to Leipzig with one attendant; <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and Carlstadt entered the city accompanied by an army of adherents, mostly students. The preliminaries were carefully arranged; after which, from 27 June to 4 July (1519) <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Eck</a> and Carlstadt debated the subject of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> and our ability to cooperate with grace. <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Eck</a> had the better part of the argument throughout, and forced his antagonist to make admissions which stultified the new <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. Thereupon <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> himself came forward to assail the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of Roman supremacy by Divine right. Sweeping away the authority of <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">decretals</a>, councils, and Fathers, he discovered to his hearers, and possibly also to himself, how completely he had abandoned the basic principles of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion. There could no longer remain a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that a new <a href="../cathen/07584b.htm">Hus</a> had arisen to scourge the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The debate on the primacy was succeeded by discussions of <a href="../cathen/12575a.htm">purgatory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07783a.htm">indulgences</a>, penance, etc. On 14 and 15 July, Carlstadt, regaining <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, resumed the debate on <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> and <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">works</a>. Finally, Duke George declared the disputation closed, and each of the contendents departed, as usual, claiming the victory.

<p>Of the two <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, Erfurt and <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, to which the final decision had been reserved, Erfurt declined to intervene and returned the documents; <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> sat in judgment upon <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> writings, attaching to each of his opinions the proper <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> censure. The most tangible outcome of this disputation was that, while it opened the eyes of Duke George to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther's</a> revolt and attached him unalterably to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of his fathers, on the other hand it gained for the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> cause the valuable aid of the youthful <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, who never understood the merits of the controversy, but was overawed by the vigorous <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> of the Reformer.

<p>The Leipzig Disputation was the last occasion on which the ancient custom of swearing to advance no tenet contrary to <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> was observed. In all subsequent debates between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, the bare text of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Writ</a> was taken as the sole and sufficient fountain of authority. This, naturally, placed the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in a disadvantageous position and narrowed their prospect of success. This was particularly the case in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, where <a href="../cathen/15772a.htm">Zwingli</a> and his lieutenants organized a number of one-sided debates under the presidency of town councils already won over to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. Such were the disputations of <a href="../cathen/15770b.htm">Zurich</a>, 1523, of <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Swiss</a> Baden, 1526, and of <a href="../cathen/02507b.htm">Berne</a>, 1528. In all of these the result was invariably the same, the abolition of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> worship and the <a href="../cathen/04748c.htm">desecration</a> of churches and religious institutions.

<p>Passing over the numerous futile attempts made by the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> to heal their intestine quarrels by means of colloquies, we come to the still more hopeless efforts of <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a> to bring the religious troubles of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> to a "speedy and peaceful termination" by conferences between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> divines. Since the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> proclaimed their determination to adhere to the terms of the Augsburg Confession, and, in addition, formally repudiated the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a> and "would admit no other judge of the controversy than Jesus Christ", it was to be foreseen that the result of conferences thus conducted could only be to waste time and increase the acrimony already existing between the parties. This was as clear to <a href="../cathen/11579a.htm">Pope Paul III</a> as to <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, both of whom predicted the inevitable failure. However, since the emperor and his brother, King Ferdinand, persisted in making a trial, the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> authorized his <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a>, Morone, to proceed to <a href="../cathen/14214e.htm">Speyer</a>, whither the meeting had been summoned for June, 1540. As the plague was raging in that city the conference took place in Hagenau. Neither the Elector of Saxony nor the Landgrave of <a href="../cathen/07298c.htm">Hesse</a> could be induced to attend. <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> was absent through a heavy illness brought on by grief and shame at the ignoble part he had taken in the affair of the Landgrave's bigamy. The leading <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> at the conference were <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer</a>, Myconius, Brenz, Blaurer, and Urbanus Rhegius. The most prominent on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side were Bishop Faber of <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a> and <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Dr. Eck</a>. Present and actively intriguing to prevent an accommodation was <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">John Calvin</a>, then exiled from <a href="../cathen/09040a.htm">Geneva</a>; he appeared as confidential agent of the King of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, whose settled policy it was to perpetuate religious discord in the domains of his rival. After a month wasted in useless wrangling, King Ferdinand prorogued the conference to reassemble at Worms on 28 October.

<p>Undismayed by the failure of the Hagenau conference, the emperor made more strenuous efforts for the success of the coming colloquy at Worms. He dispatched his minister <a href="../cathen/06727a.htm">Granvella</a> and Ortiz, his envoy, to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> court. The latter brought with him the celebrated <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a>, Father Peter Faber. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> sent the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Feltri, Tommaso Campeggio, brother of the great <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinal</a>, and ordered Morone to attend. They were not to take part in the debates, but were to watch events closely and report to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <a href="../cathen/06727a.htm">Granvella</a> opened the proceedings at Worms, 25 Nov., with an eloquent and conciliatory address. He pictured the evils which had befallen <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, "once the first of all nations in fidelity, religion, piety, and divine worship", and warned his hearers that "all the evils that shall come upon you and your people, if, by clinging stubbornly to preconceived notions, you prevent a renewal of concord, will be ascribed to you as the authors of them." On behalf of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> returned "an intrepid answer"; he threw all the blame upon the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who refused to accept the new Gospel.

<p>A great deal of time was spent in wrangling over points of order; finally it was decided that <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Dr. Eck</a> should be spokesman for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. The debate began 14 Jan., 1541. A tactical blunder was committed in accepting the Augsburg Confession as the basis of the conference. That document had been drawn up to meet an emergency. It was apologetic and conciliatory, so worded as to persuade the young emperor that there was no radical difference between the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. It admitted the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">spiritual jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and tacitly acknowledged the supremacy of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> by laying the ultimate appeal with a council by him convened. But many changes had taken place in the ten intervening years. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had been driven out of every <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> territory in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>; the Smalkald confederates had solemnly <a href="../cathen/01044d.htm">abjured</a> the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and scorned his proffer of a council; each petty territorial prince had constituted himself the head and exponent of religion within his domain. For all practical purposes the Augsburg Confession was as useless as the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of Lycurgus. Moreover, as <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Dr. Eck</a> pointed out, the Augsburg Confession of 1540 was a different document from the Confession of 1530, having been changed by <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> to suit his sacramentarian view of the Eucharist. Had the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> at Worms reached an agreement on every point of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, the discord in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> would have continued none the less; for the princes had not the remotest <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of giving up their lucrative dominion over their territorial churches. <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Eck</a> and <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a> battled four days over the topic of <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a> and its consequences, and a formula was drafted to which both parties agreed, the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> with a reservation.

<p>At this point <a href="../cathen/06727a.htm">Granvella</a> suspended the conference, to be resumed at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, whither the emperor had summoned a diet, which he promised to attend in person. This diet, from which the emperor anticipated brilliant results, was called to order 5 April, 1541. As <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> appeared <a href="../cathen/04323c.htm">Cardinal Contarini</a>, assisted by the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">nuncio</a> Morone. The inevitable <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a> was present, ostensibly to represent Luneburg, in reality to foster discord in the interest of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. As collocutors at the religious conference which met simultaneously, Charles appointed <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Eck</a>, <a href="../cathen/11787a.htm">Pflug</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07036b.htm">Gropper</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> side, and <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12118a.htm">Pistorius</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>. A document of mysterious origin, the "Ratisbon Book", was presented by Joachim of Brandenburg as the basis of agreement. This strange compilation, it developed later, was the result of secret conferences, held during the meeting at Worms, between the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer</a> and Capito, on one side, and the <a href="../cathen/09458a.htm">Lutheranizing</a> <a href="../cathen/07036b.htm">Gropper</a> and a secretary of the emperor named Veltwick on the other. It consisted of twenty-three chapters, in which, by an ingenious phraseology, the attempt was made so to formulate the controverted doctrines that each party might find its own views therein expressed. How much Charles and <a href="../cathen/06727a.htm">Granvella</a> had to do in the transaction, is unknown; they certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> and approved of it. The "Book" had been submitted by the Elector of Brandenburg to the judgment of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a> and <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>; and their contemptuous treatment of it augured ill for its success. When it was shown to the <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> and Morone, the latter was for rejecting it summarily; <a href="../cathen/04323c.htm">Contarini</a>, after making a score of emendations, notably emphasizing in Article 14 the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm#section3">Transubstantiation</a>, declared that now "as a private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>" he could accept it; but as <a href="../cathen/09118a.htm">legate</a> he must consult with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>. <a href="../cathen/05271b.htm">Eck</a> secured the substitution of a conciser exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of justification. Thus emended, the "Book" was presented to the collocutors by <a href="../cathen/06727a.htm">Granvella</a> for consideration. The first four articles, treating of man before the fall, <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, the origin of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11312a.htm">original sin</a>, were accepted. The battle began in earnest when the fifth article, on justification, was reached. After long and vehement debates, a formula was presented by <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Bucer</a> and accepted by the majority, so worded as to be capable of bearing a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and a <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> interpretation. Naturally, it was unsatisfactory to both parties. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> condemned it and administered a severe rebuke to <a href="../cathen/04323c.htm">Contarini</a> for not protesting against it. No greater success was attained as to the other articles of importance.

<p>On 22 May the conference ended, and the emperor was informed as to the articles agreed upon and those on which agreement was impossible. Charles was sorely disappointed, but he was powerless to effect anything further. The <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> known as the "Ratisbon Interim", published 28 July, 1541, enjoining upon both sides the observance of the articles agreed upon by the <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, was by both sides disregarded. Equally without result was the last of the conferences summoned by Charles at <a href="../cathen/12657a.htm">Ratisbon</a>, 1546, just previously to the outbreak of the Smalkaldic War.
<h2>The colloquy at Poissy</h2>

<p>In 1561 six <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">cardinals</a> and thirty-eight <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, with a host of minor <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> and <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, wasted in a barren controversy with the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> an entire month, which might have been spent far more advantageously to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and more in consonance with the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of their offices had they taken their places in the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. The conference had been arranged by <a href="../cathen/03443a.htm">Catharine de' Medici</a>, the queen-mother and regent during the minority of her son, Charles IX. Between this typical representative of the <a href="../cathen/10120a.htm">Medici</a> and her contemporary, Elizabeth of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, there was little to choose. With both religion was simply a matter of expediency and politics. The <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> faction in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, though less than half a million in number, was aggressive and insolent, under the guidance of several princes of the royal blood and members of the higher nobility. The fatal virus of Gallicanism and chronic disaffection towards the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> paralysed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> activity; and although a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> was in session under the legitimate presidency of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">Roman pontiff</a>, voices were heard even among the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, advocating the convocation of a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a> <a href="../cathen/14389a.htm">national synod</a>. We may regard it as an extenuation of the guilt of Catharine and her advisers, that they refused to go the whole length of a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and chose the alternative of a religious conference under the direction of the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil power</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> did his utmost to prevent what, under the circumstances, could only he construed as a public defiance of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority. He dispatched the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, with Laynez, General of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a>, as his adviser, to dissuade the regent and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. But the affair had gone too far; on 9 Sept. the representatives of the rival <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> began their pleadings before a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and a boy eleven years old. The proceedings were opened by a speech of Chancellor L'H&ocirc;pital, in which he emphasized the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the monarch to provide for the needs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Even should a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> be in session, a colloquy between <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchmen</a> convened by the king was the better way of settling religious disputes; for a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a>, being, for the most part, composed of foreigners, was incapable of understanding the wishes and the needs of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Yet these French politicians who refused to submit <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">articles of faith</a> to the decision of a <a href="../cathen/04423f.htm">general council</a> because the majority of the Fathers were not French, chose as authoritative expounders of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the Genevan Beza and the Italian Vermigli.

<p>It was a deep humiliation for the proud <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> to be compelled to listen to a long tirade by Beza against the most cherished of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrines</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05573a.htm">Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist</a>. They suppressed their feelings, out of respect for the king, until the hardy Reformer, in the heat of argument, gave utterance to his conviction that the Body and Blood of Christ were as far distant from the <a href="../cathen/01349d.htm">bread</a> and <a href="../cathen/01358a.htm">wine</a>, as the highest <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is from the earth. This was too much for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to bear, and they cried out, "He <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemeth</a>". It was too much for Catharine herself, and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to her that the fundamental <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was at stake. Beza's speech, revised and emended, was scattered broadcast among the people of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. We are told that the <a href="../cathen/03333b.htm">Cardinal</a> of Lorraine confuted the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> at the next session in a masterly address; but since he did not set it down in writing its value cannot be ascertained. The only sensible speech made at this colloquy was that of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> Laynez, who had the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to remind the queen that the proper place for ventilating subjects concerning the Faith was <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Trent</a>, not <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>; that the Divinely appointed judge of the religious controversies was the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">supreme pontiff</a>, not the Court of <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>. Catharine wept; but instead of following the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit's</a> wise counsel, she appointed a committee of five <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinists</a> and five lukewarm <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who drafted a vague formula which could be interpreted in a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or a <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinistic</a> sense, and was consequently condemned by both parties.

<p>The spread of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> and the application of its fundamental principle of private judgment naturally produced far-reaching differences in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. To heal these and so bring about unity, various conferences were held: at Weimar (1560), between the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, Striegel and Flacius, on <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>; at Altenburg (1568-69), between the Jena <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> and those from <a href="../cathen/15678b.htm">Wittenberg</a>, on <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> and justification; at Montb&eacute;liard (1586), between Beza and the T&uuml;bingen <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>, on <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestination</a>. None of these resulted in harmony; they rather emphasized divergences in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and intensified partisanship.
<h2>Discussions in modern times</h2>

<p>The conference of Poissy was the last attempt made to reconcile or slur over the radical differences of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicity</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. There have been some notable oral debates between champions of the rival <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> in more recent times; but in these each side laboured to establish its own position and prove that of its adversary untenable. The most memorable and successful of these modern disputations was the "Conference on the Authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>" held 8 March, 1679, between <a href="../cathen/02698b.htm">Bossuet</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> minister Jean Claude. This was a model of close debate, in which, with due courtesy, each antagonist kept strictly to the subject in hand, the relation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. The fondness of English-speaking peoples for public disputes has often shown itself in challenges, generally delivered by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> controversialists, to discuss religious topics in public. As a rule, they have produced no good results, since both sides revived wornout arguments and wandered over too wide a field. Such was the "Controversial Discussion between Rev. Thomas Maguire and Rev. Richard T. Pope", held in the lecture-room of the Dublin Institution in April, 1827, Daniel O'Connell being one of the presiding officers. It was printed and widely circulated. Of a similar nature was the "Debate on the Roman Catholic Religion", held in Cincinnati from 13 to 21 Jan., 1837, between Alexander Campbell, the founder of the Campbellite <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12570a.htm">Bishop John B. Purcell</a>. More satisfactory, because confined within closer limits, was the celebrated "Discussion of the Question, Is the Roman <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Religion, in any or in all its Principles or Doctrines, Inimical to Civil or Religious Liberty? and of the Question, Is the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> Religion, in any or in all its Principles or Doctrines, Inimical to Civil or Religious Liberty?" debated in Philadelphia in 1836 between Rev. John Hughes, later <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of New York, and Rev. John Breckinridge of the <a href="../cathen/12392b.htm">Presbyterian</a> Church. Both parties kept their tempers remarkably well; but to judge from the violent riots which broke out not long after, the debate had little effect in extinguishing unreasoning prejudices. With the exception of a debate on the question of St. Peter's residence in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, held in the <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Eternal City</a> in 1872, there have been no oral religious discussions in recent times and this method of elucidating religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may be regarded as discountenanced by modern public opinion.
