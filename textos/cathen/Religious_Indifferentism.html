<div id="springfield2">
<h1>Religious Indifferentism</h1>  

<p>The term given, in general, to all those theories, which, for one reason or another, deny that it is the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of man to worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> and practicing the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">one true religion</a>. This religious Indifferentism is to be distinguished from <em>political</em> indifferentism, which is applied to the policy of a state that treats all the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> within its borders as being on an equal footing before the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of the country. Indifferentism is not to be confounded with religious indifference. The former is primarily a theory disparaging the value of religion; the latter term designates the conduct of those who, whether they do or do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the necessity and utility of religion, do in fact neglect to fulfil its <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>.
<h2 id="section1">Absolute indifferentism</h2>

<p>Under the above general definition come those philosophic systems which reject the ultimate foundation of all religion, that is, man's acknowledgment of his dependence on a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">personal creator</a>, whom, in consequence of this dependence, he is bound to reverence, obey, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. This <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is common to all <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheistic</a>, <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">materialistic</a>, <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">agnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophies</a>. If there is no <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheist</a> professes to believe, or if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> be but the sum of material forces, or if the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Supreme Being</a> is an all-embracing, all-confounding totality in which human individuality is lost, then the personal relationship in which religion takes its rise does not exist. Again, if the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> is incapable of attaining certitude as to whether <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God exists</a> or not, or is even unable to form any valid <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it follows that religious worship is a mere futility. This <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is shared also by the <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deists</a>, who, while they admit the existence of a personal <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, deny that he demands any worship from His creatures. These systems are answered by the <a href="../cathen/01618a.htm">apologist</a> who proves that every one is bound to practice religion as a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in order that he may attain the end for which he has been called into existence.
<h2 id="section2">Restricted indifferentism</h2>

<p>In distinction from this absolute Indifferentism, a restricted form of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> admits the necessity of religion on account, chiefly, of its salutary influence on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. But it holds that all <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> are equally worthy and profitable to man, and equally pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The classic advocate of this theory is <a href="../cathen/13212b.htm">Rousseau</a>, who maintains, in his "Emile", that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> looks only to the sincerity of intention, and that everybody can serve Him by remaining in the religion in which he has been brought up, or by changing it at will for any other that pleases him more (Emile, III). This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> is widely advocated today on the grounds that, beyond the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608b.htm">God's existence</a>, we can attain to no certain religious <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and that, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has left us thus in uncertainty, He will be pleased with whatever form of worship we sincerely offer Him. The full reply to this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> consists in the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has vouchsafed to man a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation, embodying a definite religion, which He desires that all should embrace and practice. Without appealing to this fact, however, a little consideration suffices to lay bare the inherent absurdity of this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>. All <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, indeed, may be said to contain some measure of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> may accept the imperfect worship of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> sincerity. But it is injurious to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, to assert that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and falsehood are indifferent in His sight. Since various <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> are in disagreement, it follows that, wherever they conflict, if one possesses the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the others are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. The constituent elements of a religion are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> to be held by the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a> to be observed, and a form of worship to be practiced. Now &#151; to confine ourselves to the great <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of the world &#151; <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a>, <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> of <a href="../cathen/07722a.htm">India</a> and the Orient are in direct antagonism by their respective creeds, moral codes, and cults. To say that all these irreconcilable <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> and cults are equally pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is to say that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Divine Being</a> has no predilection for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> over <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> are alike congenial to His nature. Again, to hold that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and falsehood equally satisfy and perfect the human <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is to deny that reason has a native bent towards, and affinity for, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. If we deny this we deny that any trust is to be placed in our reason. Turn to the <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> side of the question. Here again there is conflict over almost all the great moral issues. Let an illustration or two suffice. <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Mohammedanism</a> approves <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> uncompromisingly condemns it as immoral. If these two teachers are equally trustworthy guides of life, then there is no such thing as fixed moral values at all. If the obscene orgies of phallic worship are as pure in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the austere worship that was conducted in the <a href="../cathen/14499a.htm">temple of Jerusalem</a>, then we must hold the Deity to be destitute of all moral attributes, in which case there would be no grounds for religion at all. The fact is that this type of Indifferentism, though verbally acknowledging the excellence and utility of religion, nevertheless, when pressed by <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logic</a>, recoils into absolute Indifferentism. "All <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> are equally good" comes to mean, at bottom, that religion is good for nothing.


<h2 id="section3">Liberal or latitudinarian indifferentism</h2>
<h3 id="A">Origin and growth</h3>

<p>The foregoing types of Indifferentism are conveniently called infidel, to distinguish them from a third, which, while acknowledging the unique Divine origin and character of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and its consequent immeasurable superiority over all rival <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, holds that what particular <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> one belongs to is an indifferent matter; all forms of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> are on the same footing, all are equally pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and serviceable to man. On approaching this third <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> one may advantageously inquire into the genesis of Indifferentism in general. In doing so we shall find that liberal Indifferentism, as the third type is called, although it arises in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, is closely akin to that of infidelity; and this community of origin will account for the tendency which is today working towards the union of both in a common mire of scepticism. Indifferentism springs from <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a>. By <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> here we understand the principle that reason is the sole judge and discoverer of religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as of all other kinds of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. It is the antithesis of the principle of authority which asserts that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation, has taught man religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> that are inaccessible to our mere unaided reason, as well as other <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which, though not absolutely beyond the native powers of reason, yet could not by reason alone be brought home to the generality of men with the facility, certitude, and freedom from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> required for the right ordering of life. From the earliest ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> spirit manifested itself in various <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> it infected the teachings of many notable <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and reigned unchecked in the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moorish</a> centres of learning. Its influence may be traced through the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> to the rise of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> (see <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">RATIONALISM</a>).

<p>From the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> current flowed with ever-increasing volume through two distinct channels, which, though rising apart, have been gradually approaching each other. The one operated through purely philosophic thought which, wherever it set itself free from the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, has on the whole served to display what has been justly called the "all-corroding, all-dissolving scepticism of the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> in religious matters". <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalistic</a> speculation gave rise successively to the <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">English</a> <a href="../cathen/04679b.htm">Deism</a> of the eighteenth century, to the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05418a.htm">French Encyclopaedists</a> and their descendants, and to the various German systems of anti-Christian thought. It has culminated in the prevalent <a href="../cathen/10041b.htm">materialistic</a>, <a href="../cathen/10483a.htm">monistic</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">agnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophies</a> of today. When the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> rejected the dogmatic authority of the living Church they substituted for it that of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>. But their <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a> was the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, interpreted by private judgment. This <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> introduced the principle of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> into the very structure of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. The history of that movement is a record of continually increasing divisions, multiplications of <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, with a steady tendency to reduce the contents of a fixed dogmatic creed. In a few words <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Cardinal Newman</a> has summed up the lesson of that history: "Experience proves surely that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> does not answer a purpose for which it was never intended. It may be accidentally the means of converting <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a>; but a book after all cannot make a stand against the wild living <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> of man, and in this day it begins to testify, as regards its own structure and contents, to the power of that universal solvent which is so successfully acting upon religious establishments" (Apologia pro Vita Sua, London, 1883, v. 245). As divisions increased in the general body of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, and as domestic dissentions arose in the bosom of particular <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>, some of the leaders endeavoured to find a principle of harmony in the theory that the essential <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrines of Christianity</a> are summed up in a few great, simple <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which are clearly expressed in <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, and that, consequently, whoever believes these and regulates his life accordingly is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> follower of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. This movement failed to stay the process of disintegration, and powerfully promoted the opinion that, provided one accepts <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, it makes little difference to what particular denomination one adheres. The view spread that there is no creed definitely set forth in <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, therefore all are of equal value, and all profitable to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Large numbers in the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Church of England</a> adopted this opinion, which came to be known as <a href="../cathen/09212a.htm">Liberalism</a> or Latitudinarianism. It was not, however, confined to one form of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, but obtained adherents in almost every body inheriting from the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. The effort was made to reconcile it with the official confessions by introducing the policy of permitting every one to interpret the compulsory formulae in his own sense.

<p>Indifferentism, liberal and infidel, has been vigorously promoted during the past half century by the dominance of <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> in all the lines of scientific inquiry which touch upon religion. The theory of evolution applied to the origin of man, Biblical criticism of the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, the comparative study of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, archaeology, and ethnology, in the hands of men who assume as their primary postulate that there is no <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, and that all <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> included, are but the offspring of the feeling and thought of the natural man, have propagated a general atmosphere of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> or positive unbelief. As a result, large numbers of <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> have abandoned all distinctly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, while others, still clinging to the name, have emptied their creed of all its essential dogmatic contents. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of Scriptural inspiration and inerrancy is all but universally abandoned. It would not, perhaps, be incorrect to say that the prevalent view today is that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> taught no dogmatic <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, His teaching was purely <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a>, and its only permanent and valuable content is summed up in the Fatherhood of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the brotherhood of man. When this point is reached the Indifferentism which arose in <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> joins hands with the Indifferentism of infidelity. The latter substitutes for religion, the former advocates as the only essential of religion, the broad fundamental principles of natural morality, such as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">veracity</a>, and benevolence that takes concrete form in social service. In some minds this theory of life is combined with <a href="../cathen/01215c.htm">Agnosticism</a>, in others with a vague Theism, while in many it is still united with some vestiges of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>.

<p>Along with the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> cause just noted, another has been what one might call the automatic influence proceeding from the existence of many <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> side by side in the same country. This condition has given rise to the political indifferentism referred to in the opening of this article. Where this state of affairs prevails, when men of various creeds meet one another in political, commercial, and social life, in order that they may carry on their relations harmoniously they will not demand any special recognition of their own respective <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a>. Personal intercourse fosters the spirit of tolerance, and whoever does not unflinchingly hold to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that there is but one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion is apt to be guided in his judgments by the maxim, "From their fruits ye shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them." On observing that probity and good intention mark the lives of some of his associates who differ in their religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a>, he may easily come to the conclusion that one religion is as good as another. Probably, however, many who speak thus would acknowledge the fallacy of this view if pushed by argument. On the other hand, great numbers of theoretical Indifferentists display unmistakable hostility to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; while, again, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> devoid of all religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, favour the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as an efficient element of police for the preservation of the social order.
<h3 id="B">Criticism</h3>

<p>It would be beyond the scope of this article to develop, or even briefly sketch, the argument contained in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that, from the beginning, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was a dogmatic religion with a <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>, a rule of conduct, a definite, if not fully developed, system, with promises to be fulfilled for those who adhered to the creed, the discipline, and the system, and with <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathemas</a> for those who rejected them. The exposition and the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of these facts constitute, in <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>, the treatise on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (see <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">CHURCH</a>). One obvious consideration may be briefly pointed out which lays bare the inconsistency of liberal indifferentism. If, as this theory admits, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did reveal any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to men, then He surely intended that it should be believed. He can not have meant that men should treat His revelation as of no importance, or that it should signify one thing to you and something entirely different to me, nor can He be indifferent as to whether men interpret it correctly or incorrectly. If He revealed a religion, reason certainly tells us that such a religion must be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and all others that disagree with it <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>, and that He desires men to embrace it; otherwise, why should He have given any revelation at all? It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that in many places the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> are obscure and furnish to those who assume to interpret them by the light of private judgment alone many occasions of reaching irreconcilable conclusions. This fact, however, proves only the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falseness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> <a href="../cathen/05766b.htm">rule of faith</a>. The inference that flows from it is not that all interpretations are equally trustworthy, but that, since <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has given us a revelation which is not so clearly or fully expressed in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> that reason can grasp it with certitude, He must have constituted some authority to teach us what is the burden of revelation.

<p>The cogency of this reasoning when set forth at adequate length has led into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> many sincere non-Catholics, who have observed how <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">Rationalism</a> is rapidly dissolving religious <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> over wide areas once occupied by dogmatic <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>. Present signs seem to indicate that, in the near future, the religious struggle shall be, not between this or that form of religion, but between <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> and no religion at all. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, of course, that reason, as the <a href="../cathen/15303a.htm">Vatican Council</a> teaches, can, by its own native powers, reach with certitude the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> which suffice to form the basis of a natural religion. But it is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that, as <a href="../cathen/10794a.htm">Newman</a> has said, the tendency of the human <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, as such, has been, historically, towards simple unbelief in matters of religion: "No <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, however sacred, can stand against it in the long run; and hence it is that in the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">Pagan</a> world, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> came, the last traces of the religious <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of former times were all but disappearing from those portions of the world in which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> had been active and had a career" (Apologia, chap. v). These words might stand with but little modification as a description of present-day conditions where the <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalistic</a> spirit is in control. The only effective barrier to resist its triumphant march, leading scepticism in its train, is the principle of authority embodied in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.
