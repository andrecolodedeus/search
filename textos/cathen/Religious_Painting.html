<h1>Religious Painting</h1>  

<p>Painting has always been associated with the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. From the time of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacombs</a> it has been used in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ornamentation, and for centuries after <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine</a>, <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">religious art</a> was the only form of living art in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> world. Its fecundity has been wonderful and even now, although much diminished, is still important. Until the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> exercised a veritable monopoly over this sphere. Profane painting in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> dates only from the last five centuries and it took the lead only in the nineteenth century. It may therefore be said that throughout the <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">Christian Era</a> the history of painting has been that of religious painting.

<p>It would be absurd to seek to place the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in contradiction to the Gospel on this point, as did the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclasts</a> in the eighth century and the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> in the sixteenth. The <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has been clearly enunciated by Molanus in his "Historia SS. Imaginum" (Louvain, 1568). It is truly remarkable that such a magnificent development of artistic thought should proceed from a purely spiritual <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> preached by <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> Galilean fishermen who were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of art and filled with the horror of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> characteristic of the <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> people. Far from reproaching the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with infidelity to the teachings of her Founder, we should rather acknowledge her wisdom in rejecting no natural form of human activity and thus furthering the work of civilization.

<p>The very fact that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> permitted painting <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> her to assign it a definite object and to prescribe certain rules. Art never seemed to her an end in itself; as soon as she adopted it she made it a means of instruction and edification. "The picture", says the <a href="../cathen/11050a.htm">Patriarch Nicephorus</a>, "conceals the strength of the Gospel under a coarser, but more expressive form." "The picture is to the illiterate", says <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Pope St. Gregory</a>, "what the written word is to the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>." In like manner <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>: "What speech presents to the ear painting portrays by a mute imitation." And <a href="../cathen/11763b.htm">Peter Comestor</a> says, in a famous text: "The paintings of the churches are in place of books to the uneducated" (<em>quasi libri laicorum</em>). "We are, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace of God</a>, those who manifest to the faithful the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>"&mdash;thus the painters of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> express themselves in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of their guild (1355). The same <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are contained in the "Treatise on Painting" of Cennino Cennini, and in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> in the "Livre des M&eacute;tiers" of the <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Parisian</a> Etienne Boileau (1254). In 1513, at the height of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, <a href="../cathen/05209c.htm">Albrecht D&uuml;rer</a> wrote: "The art of painting is used in the service of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to depict the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">sufferings of Christ</a> and of many other models; it also preserves the countenances of men after their death." Almost the same definition is given by Pacheco, father-in-law of <a href="../cathen/15323a.htm">Velasquez</a>, in his "Arte de la Pintura", printed at Seville in 1649.

<p>The constant <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was defined at the <a href="../cathen/11045a.htm">Second Council of Nicaea</a> (787), and is summed up in the often quoted formula: "The composition of the image is not the invention of the painters, but the result of the legislation and approved tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>" ("Synod Nicaea" II, Actio VI, 331, 832). It would be impossible to define more clearly the importance of art in the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and at the same time its subordinate position. Thence, obviously, results one of the chief characteristics of religious painting, its conservative <a href="../cathen/08050b.htm">instinct</a> and its tendency to hieratic formalism. Art being regarded as didactic, necessarily partook of the severe nature of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. The slightest <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> bordered on <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. To alter anything in the garments of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> or of the Blessed Virgin, to depict the former shod or the latter barefooted, to confuse the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of the simple by innovations and individual whims, were all serious matters. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> artist was surrounded by a strict network of prohibitions and prescriptions. From this resulted the artistic danger of soulless, mechanical repetition, which religious painting did not always escape. The responsibility for this however, must not be merited to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but rather to human <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothfulness</a> of mind, for, as a matter of fact, there is an element of mobility in art as it is understood by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Religious art may be called a realistic art. Its appeal to the emotions by the representation of facts obliges it to be more and more exactly imitative, and it must adopt the progressive stages of technique to express all the phases of human feeling. Even the most immobile of the great <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, the Byzantine, has only an apparent immobility; more intimate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> inspires increasing admiration for its vitality and elasticity. The innovating and creative faculty has never been denied to the religious painters. In the twelfth century <a href="../cathen/05207a.htm">Guillaume Durand</a>, the famous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10180a.htm">Mende</a>, wrote in his "Rationale" (I, 3): "The various histories as well of the New as of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> are depicted according to the inclination of the painters. For to painters as to poets a license has ever been conceded to dare whatever they pleased."
<h2 id="section1">The catacombs</h2>

<p>The monuments of religious painting for the first four centuries are to be sought only at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (see <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">ROMAN CATACOMBS</a>; <a href="../cathen/05248a.htm">ECCLESIASTICAL ART</a>). But this peculiar art must not be taken as typical of what was in vogue elsewhere. It is a great mistake to look in the Roman cemeteries for the origin or the cradle of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> painting: an art which seems to have been fully developed by the end of the fifth entry grew up in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, or <a href="../cathen/01782a.htm">Asia Minor</a>, and completely supplanted that of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacombs</a>. The latter did not survive the very special conditions under which it arose, and was but an isolated and local <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> without development or future, but none the less valuable, venerable, and pleasing.


<h2 id="section2">Byzantine painting</h2>
<h3 id="A">The new iconography</h3>

<p>By the edict of 313 <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was recognized as the official religion of the Empire. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> left its hiding places and breathed freely, and the period of the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilicas</a> began. A profound transformation of religious painting was the result of this triumph. The time had come to display the insignia of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> victory with the same material splendour which the State attached to the imperial majesty of Caesar. The Good Shepherd of the <a href="../cathen/03417b.htm">Catacombs</a> and the pastoral scenes gradually disappeared; the last traces of them are found in the rotunda of St. Constantia and in the mausoleum of Galla Placidia at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> (c. 450). In the magnificent <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> of S. Pudenziana at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (before 410), the Cross, which stands in mid-heaven above a Senate of Apostles wearing the laticlave, is already a symbol of triumph. Christ appears as a celestial <em>imperator</em> invested with awe-inspiring glory. "The arches of the world", writes Eusebius, "are His throne, the earth is His footstool. The celestial armies are His guard."&mdash;Thus formidably is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the Gospel portrayed on the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">porch</a> of the ancient Vatican.

<p>Rome still preserves the oldest remains of the new art, but the East has claims to priority. Such discoveries as those of M. Cl&eacute;dat in the <a href="../cathen/03504a.htm">necropolis</a> of El Bagaout (fourth century) and in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Baouit (sixth century), the excavations of Gayet in the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tombs</a> of <a href="../cathen/01564a.htm">Antinoe</a> and the funeral portraits unearthed at Fayum form an accumulation of evidence which leaves no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> on this point. To these may be added the famous miniatures of <a href="../cathen/04404a.htm">Cosmas Indicopleustes</a> and of the "Roll of Joshua" (preserved at the Vatican), the originals of which date from the sixth century, or those of the Mesopotamian Evangeliary, illustrated in 586 by the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Rabula (Laurentian Library, Florence), and, although of somewhat later date, the paintings of the Evangeliaries of Etschmiadzin (Armenian, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 989) and Rossano, reproduced from obviously earlier models, either Alexandrine or Syriac. These paintings are chiefly narrative and historical in character. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, having conquered <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>, must now face the task of supplying its place. And the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> quickly recognized in her own experience with <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> the efficacy of images as means of instruction. This is testified by a letter (end of the fourth century) from <a href="../cathen/11079b.htm">St. Nilus</a> to the prefect Olympiodorus, who had built a <a href="../cathen/02781a.htm">church</a> and wished to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> if it were fitting that he should adorn it only with scenes of the chase and angling, with foliage, etc., having in view only the pleasure of the eye. <a href="../cathen/11079b.htm">St. Nilus</a> replied that this was mere childish nonsense, that the fitting thing in the sanctuary was the image of the Cross, and on the walls scenes from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, so that those who, being unable to read the Scriptures, might by these pictures be reminded of the beautiful deeds of the followers of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a>, and thereby impelled to do in like manner. Obviously, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorite</a> here recommended genuine historical compositions. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. replacing the vast <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> repertory of legend and fable, created for the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> a new basis, likewise derived from the past. At that <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">date</a> the best apology for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was the story of its life and its genealogy, and this was perseveringly set forth during the early centuries after Constantine. This historical tendency is clearly evident at St. Mary Major's in the forty <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>, executed in the time of <a href="../cathen/14032a.htm">Pope Sixtus III</a> (432-40), which relate the lives of the Patriarchs <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/08175a.htm">Isaac</a>, <a href="../cathen/08261a.htm">Jacob</a>, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08524a.htm">Joshua</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> victory and His glorious <a href="../cathen/01165a.htm">Advent</a> also find expression in the "triumphal arches" of <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul's Without the Walls</a> (under <a href="../cathen/09154b.htm">Leo I</a>, 440-61) and of the <a href="../cathen/09014b.htm">Lateran</a> (under Hilary I, 461-68).

<p>But <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, conquered by the hordes of Alaric, had fallen from her political rank, and henceforth the evolution of Byzantine painting must be followed at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a> and Constantinople.
<h3 id="B">Monumental painting to the Iconoclastic controversy</h3>

<p>Representing deeds rather than ideals, events rather than symbols, the Byzantine School endowed <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> with a complete system of representation of all types, some of which are still used, and once for all formulated the essential traits of the great scenes of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">religious history</a>. (<em>See</em> <a href="../cathen/03095a.htm">BYZANTINE ART</a>.)

<p>In its early period Byzantine painting was strictly realistic. The <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>, e.g., on either side of the choir of S. Vitale at <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, show the Court of Justinian and Theodora sickly, dissolute figures&mdash;the men, coarse; the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, bleached and bedizened, overladen with jewels and dressed in the extreme of luxury unforgettable personifications of a corrupt and dazzling life. This care for documentary exactitude was applied also to the past: historic characters were treated as contemporary. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of the first three centuries had been <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to content themselves with conventional types, without individual character, for their figures of Christ; but here Byzantine art raised new questions. The <a href="../cathen/14597a.htm">Christological</a> disputes of the time necessitated new dogmatic definitions. In painting a certain <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, appealing to a text of Isaiah, maintained that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was hideous. In answer to these, appeal was made, in the fourth century, to the so-called <a href="../cathen/09154a.htm">"Letter of Lentulus to the Senate"</a>. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, according to this document, had blue eyes and light hair falling smooth to His ears, then in curls over his shoulders. One recognizes here the desire to give to the figure of the Saviour a certain majestic beauty embodied in the stereotyped traits of a portrait which leases no room for the play of fancy.

<p>The same process of determination went on at the same time for the principal characters of sacred history, for the Blessed Virgin, the <a href="../cathen/11548a.htm">Patriarchs</a>, and the Apostles, and each of these pictorial types acquired the force of a law. The Council of 692, for example decreed that Christ should be represented as the <a href="../cathen/08755b.htm">Lamb</a>. This scrupulosity extends to accessories and embellishments: at San Vitale, <a href="../cathen/12662b.htm">Ravenna</a>, the "Hospitality of Abraham" has for its setting a vast verdant landscape; at San Apollinare Nuovo, the city of Classis and the palace of <a href="../cathen/14576a.htm">Theodoric</a> are accurately represented. In Gospel scenes veritable reproductions of <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a> were aimed at. The care for exact representation was, at the same time, counteracted by the passion for grandeur and splendour of effect which dominated all Byzantine painting. The latter tendency arose partly from the exigencies of decorative work and the inexorable <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> governing monumental style. Decoration implies work intended to be viewed from a distance, and therefore simple in outline and colossal in scale, reduced to absolute essentials strikingly displayed on a wall-surface. Hence certain conventions, the result of optical <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>: few gestures, little action, no agitation or confusion. The countenances have an impassive and fixed expression, as the tragic actor, in the Greek theatre, assumed mask and cothurnus, and chanted the solemn lines to a recitative.

<p>This theatrical and imposing style was, however, less artificial than might be supposed. It naturally ascribed to the personages of the sacred drama the ceremonious dignity of the Byzantine world, modelling the past or the present. One of the most marked effects of these <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> is the repugnance to representing suffering and death. At San Apollinare Nuovo, in the portrayal of the Passion, not Christ, but his executioner, carries His Cross. The artist reverently omits the scene on Calvary, and indeed <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> for a long time observed the same reticence. But on the other hand there is the taste for noble composition the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of symmetry, the striving after grandiose and solemn effects. From these same ideals of pomp and grandeur resulted a type of expression in harmony with them, monumental painting in the more solid, more luxurious style of <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a>. This was already an ancient art, well known to the Alexandrians practised, also by the Romans, who used it chiefly for the pavements of their villas. But it was reserved for the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>, who applied it to mural decoration to discover its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> resources.
<h3 id="C">From the Iconoclast controversy to the school of Mount Athos</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast controversy</a> (725-850) arrested the development of this powerful <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> at its height. The movement originated in <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Islam</a> as a fierce outburst of the <a href="../cathen/13706a.htm">Semitic</a> <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">idealism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast</a> emperors were by no means barbarians but enlightened princes dilettanti in their way, very often devotees and <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a>; such in particular were Leo the Isaurian and Theophilus. These emperors prided themselves on being worshippers "in spirit and in truth", and proscribed art only in its "idolatrous", or religious, applications. Feminine devotion in the end triumphed over these scruples. Meanwhile there had been wide devastation, the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a> had suffered especially; and when the <a href="../cathen/07664a.htm">veneration of images</a> was re-established, nearly all the churches had lost their ornaments, the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> had been torn down, and the frescoes whitewashed. As often happens, however, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> came out of the conflict more vigorous than ever. A new Byzantine School, very different from the first, and a second golden age were to commence. The first Byzantine School was an historical one the second was wholly <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> and didactic. Each decorative element assumed a symbolical value. Christ the king surrounded by the celestial <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> looks down from the vaults; in the sanctuary, behind the altar, reigns the Virgin seated, holding the Child in her lap as a figure of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the "living throne of the Almighty", the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> presents the precursors of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a>, and two great Eucharistic scenes the "Communion of the Apostles" and the "Divine Liturgy"; on the walls are developed the lives of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and that of Christ. In the story of the Gospel the order of time is broken and from the mass of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> a few great scenes are detached which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> celebrates at the twelve principal feasts. Two essential <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> are brought into prominence: the Redemption and the <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">Resurrection</a> &mdash; the scene of Calvary and the Descent into Limbo. In the <a href="../cathen/10704b.htm">narthex</a>, the Life of the Virgin assumes a new importance, while the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, on the contrary, tends to disappear.

<p>Four important monuments in the East mark the apogee of the new style, these are: <ul><li>St. Luke in Phocis, <li>the Nea Moni of <a href="../cathen/03689b.htm">Chios</a>, <li>the beautiful church of Daphni near Athens and, <li>in <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a>, that of St. Sophia at Kiev.</ul> All four date from the tenth century but show none of the perfection of detail and precision of execution which make the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of S. Vitale a finished type of painting; but the decorative effect is beyond compare. Nothing in the art of painting can surpass these churches encased in golden shells and peopled by a host of gaunt, colossal figures. At this date most of the Gospel compositions were virtually stamped with a <em>Ne varietur</em>; for each of them a group of artistic geniuses had provided a permanent type.

<p>A more important fact is that at this time the Byzantine style conquered the West and became truly universal. At about the same time the West was undergoing a singular upheaval: the old <a href="../cathen/06058c.htm">feudalism</a> was separating itself from the soil and setting itself in motion. For two centuries the exodus of the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> was to continue, marking the beginning of a new civilization in <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Byzantine colonies appeared in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, notably those of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, in the North and of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, in the South, forming hotbeds of Byzantism at the two ends of the Peninsula. Within thirty years (1063-95) <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> accomplished the marvel of St. Mark's which she was to go on decorating and perfecting for three centuries (the <a href="../cathen/10704b.htm">narthex</a> is of the thirteenth century, the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> of the fourteenth century). In the neighbourhood of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> there are examples at Torcello, Murano, and Trieste, while the twelfth century witnesses in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, under the Norman princes the appearance of four incomparable churches: that of Martorana (1143), that of <a href="../cathen/03476a.htm">Cefal&ugrave;</a> (1148), the palace church at Palermo (c. 1160), and the <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">Cathedral</a> of <a href="../cathen/10508a.htm">Monreale</a> (c. 1180). Of all these masterpieces St. Mark's is the best known. but only from the Pantocrator in the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> at <a href="../cathen/03476a.htm">Cefal&ugrave;</a> is it possible to realize to what beauties of nobility and melancholy, and to what majesty of style, the art attained.

<p>For the sake of completeness, mention must be made of the numerous <a href="../cathen/07625a.htm">icons</a>, the various types of the Madonna (Panagia, Nicopoeia, Hodegetria), of the miniature paintings in <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscripts</a> which were important for the diffusion of motives, of enamels such as those in the Pala d'Oro of St. Mark's, and of the small portable <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> pictures, like the valuable <a href="../cathen/05022a.htm">diptych</a> preserved at the Opera del Duomo at Florence. The task of the Byzantine School was accomplished, but it did not at once disappear. In the fourteenth century it produced the fine <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaic</a> cycle of Kahrie-djami and at the beginning of the fifteenth century, within the solitude of <a href="../cathen/02047b.htm">Athos</a>, shut in by the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Moslem</a> world. it continued to produce and covered all Eastern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> with countless paintings of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Panselinos. With the twelfth century, however, it had fulfilled its purpose, and the further development of religious painting was in the West.
<h2 id="section3">Religious painting in the west, to the <em>cinquecento</em></h2>
<h3 id="A">North of the Alps</h3>

<p>Through the medium of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04543c.htm">Crusades</a> all <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> was rendered fruitful by the Byzantine School. From the Byzantine a Western art was to develop, in which the loss in external luxury was gradually supplied by pliancy and power of expression. A distinction must here be made between the art of the countries north of the Alps, and that of the southern countries. Little need be said of the former: the Romanesque churches seem to have been very rich in paintings, but most of them are lost, and in the <a href="../cathen/06665b.htm">Gothic</a> <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">churches</a>, which soon after began to be erected, there was little room for mural painting; <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained glass</a> took its place. But the <a href="../cathen/11727b.htm">personality</a> of the artist was scarcely felt in this art, and as to drawing and subjects, <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained glass</a> is scarcely more than a reflection of miniature painting. Its study, therefore, has but a purely <a href="../cathen/07625a.htm">iconographic</a> interest. It began in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> with the windows of St-Denis (1140-44), and the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of St-Denis spread throughout the North, to Chartres (c. 1145), <a href="../cathen/15733b.htm">York</a>, <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Le Mans</a> (c. 1155), <a href="../cathen/01489b.htm">Angers</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12178c.htm">Poitiers</a>. During the following century the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of Notre-Dame-de-Paris played the same part.

<p>The iconography of these windows is essentially symbolic, and the allegorical spirit of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> is nowhere more apparent. It was an old <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that each <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> and fact of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> was an image prefiguring a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> of the New. This <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> only expanded with full wealth of detail in the Gothic art of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. With wonderful subtlety of interpretation the attempt was made to discover the most unforeseen, and sometimes the oldest, relations. Books such as those of <a href="../cathen/12617a.htm">Rabanus Maurus</a>, or the "Speculum ecclesia" of <a href="../cathen/07461a.htm">Honorius of Autun</a>, or the "Glossa ordinaria" of Walafrid Strabo, must be read to obtain an <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the spirit in which the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Age</a> read its Bible and pictured it. In the "Bestiaries", too, which supplied material for this art, there is a fantastic natural history, a singular menagerie, each curiosity of which conceals some <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> allegory. The material <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> was transformed into a sort of vast psychomachia, an immense system of metaphors. No other <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> ever equalled this astounding <a href="../cathen/07634a.htm">idealism</a>.
<h3 id="B">In Italy</h3>

<p><em>(1) Giotto and the Giottesques</em>

<p>After the fall of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and the Empire, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was for centuries in a most miserable condition. In the sixth and seventh centuries the <a href="../cathen/07620a.htm">Iconoclast</a> reaction sent in the direction of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a host of Orientals, principally <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, who were the chief victims of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. It is probably to these Greeks that we owe the frescoes, doubtless <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dating</a> from the seventh century, which were discovered, in 1898, at Sta Maria Antiqua.

<p>Under the influence of the great Abbot Desiderius the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/10526b.htm">Monte Cassino</a> assumed the leadership in an artistic movement which was to extend as far as Cluny. Some eleventh-century monuments, such as the church of S. Angelo in Formis, have preserved frescoes which attest the importance of this <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>; but its traces are to be found chiefly in miniatures, and especially in volumes of a particular kind, such as the "Exultet rolls" (see <a href="../cathen/05730b.htm">EXULTET</a>). This style spread throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> in the twelfth century, but soon declined. In the churches and museums of <a href="../cathen/15103b.htm">Tuscany</a> are to be found a great number of icons, madonnas and crucifixes, such as the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous</a> Christ preserved at <a href="../cathen/04004a.htm">St. Clare of Assisi</a>, and which is said to have spoken to <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis</a>. These works show to what a depth of barbarism the Byzantine <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> had fallen about 1200. Nevertheless it was still capable of producing beautiful work. The Madonna of Guido of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, for instance, preserved in the Public Palace, and <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 1221 (not 1281, as according to Milanesi), proclaims a veritable renewal of the ancient formula, tempered by the grave and gentle <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siennese</a> <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>. This is still more obvious in the works of the great <a href="../cathen/05181c.htm">Duccio</a>, the Rucellai Madonna (1285) or the "Madonna Maesta" (1311).

<p>Such was the persistency of the Byzantine movement at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a>, but a movement in another direction issued from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in the middle of the thirteenth century. Excavations have brought to light at S. Maria in Trastevere a cycle of very important frescoes of which <a href="../cathen/06544a.htm">Ghiberti</a>, in his "Commentary" gives Pietro Cavallini as the author. The chief scene represents the Last Judgment. It is impossible to praise excessively the beauty of this composition, the nobility of the draperies, the majesty of the types. Ancient art undoubtedly exercised a powerful influence on Cavallini, as on his contemporary, the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">sculptor</a> <a href="../cathen/11047b.htm">Nicholas of Pisa</a>. In the thirteenth century a revival took place at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> which foreshadowed the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> of a later age. Unhappily, few of its monuments remain, but the <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a> of S. Maria in Trastevere that of St. Mary Major, by Jacopo Torriti (1296), and the Genesis frescoes of <a href="../cathen/13369a.htm">St. Paul Without the Walls</a> known through drawings in a <a href="../cathen/09614b.htm">manuscript</a> at the Vatican reveal the importance of this ancient Roman <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The same compositions are also found in the upper church at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, which was to be the cradle of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italian</a> painting. It is now <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that these scenes were the work of Cavallini and his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. There is nothing to prove that <a href="../cathen/03771a.htm">Cimabue</a> did not work here, but he would have done so only as a pupil of the Roman <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (see <a href="../cathen/03771a.htm">CIMABUE</a>). This is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the great <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a> in his earliest dated works: the Navicella of St. Peter's (1298), the Stefaneschi retable and the Jubilee fresco painted in 1300 at St. John Lateran. It was otherwise with his second sojourn in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, for his early Assisi frescoes the 28 scenes of the "Life of St. Francis" (c. 1293) are wholly in the Roman manner. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, therefore in the thirteenth century was created the <em>giottesco</em> style, the <em>dolce stil nuovo</em> which was to charm <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> for a hundred years. (See <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">GIOTTO DI BONDONE</a>.) <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a> instilled into the painting of age the wonderful poetry of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. St. Francis has been called the Father of Italian art and the saving is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> if taken with a certain elasticity of meaning. Both he and <a href="../cathen/05106a.htm">St. Dominic</a> rejuvenated and reanimated the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The history of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">religious art</a> down to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> could only be accurately written in the light of this great historic fact. All that Byzantine and early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> art had represented as <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> assumed the stirring character of life. To say that art became secularized would be to risk miscomprehension, but in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, from being <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> and <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a>, it became democratic and popular. Faith became visualized. The whole effort of the painters, as well as of the people, was to imagine as vividly as possible the life and <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">sufferings of Christ</a>. A multitude of dramatic elements developed in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and originated a sort of rudimentary theatre. (See <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">ITALY</a>, <a href="../cathen/08245a.htm">ITALIAN LITERATURE</a>, <a href="../cathen/08263a.htm">JACOPONE DA TODI</a>.)

<p>All these characteristics began to show themselves in painting also. At Padua, in 1306, <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a> outlined the earliest and best formulated of his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> in the "Life of the Virgin", closely linked with the history of the Passion. The painter retained only the pathetic elements of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. A number of new scenes appeared, while the old ones were enriched with countless new features. The picture is filled with figures, gestures are softened, expression grows tender and human. "Giotto", says <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a>, "was the first to put more kindness into his figures". During three centuries of development some scenes, such as the Nativity and the Epiphany, continued to grow in movement, expression, and picturesque effect. <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">Symbolism</a> and didactic intent are absent: painting ceases to have any object but to represent life. The teaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> disappear, to be replaced by scenes of sorrow and the drama of Calvary every moment of which is minutely treated in detail. What primitive <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">Christian art</a> avoided with a sort of modesty or fear now became its chosen and persistent subject. The striking feature of these pictures is a wholly new impression of familiarity and warmth.

<p>After the great frescoes of the Life of St. Francis at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> a host of local <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and contemporary <a href="../cathen/02597b.htm">beati</a> were <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honoured</a> in like manner. In painting these contemporary lives the artists had to create traditions; therefore they painted what they saw&mdash;faces, costumes, assemblages of people. They became realists and observers. and these same tendencies appeared in their paintings of the Gospel. There was little need of invention: the theatre and its representations, the processions, and the <em>tableaux vivants</em> assisted their <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>. The following are some "Passions" of the Giottesque <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, in chronological order: <ul><li>in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">lower church</a> of <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a>, by <a href="../cathen/09357c.htm">Pietro Lorenzetti</a> (c. 1325); <li>by Gerini, at S. Croce, Florence; <li>by a <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Sienese</a> master in the <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Neapolitan</a> church of Donna Regina, or <li>that by Andrea da Firenze (c. 1350) at the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>; <li>lastly the splendid frescoes of Altichiero and Avanzi in the <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> of the Santo of Padua (1370).</ul>

<p>But all this realism was never an end in itself: its object was to reach the emotions, and it made manifest the character of humanity in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Hence the many paintings of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a>, in which art incessantly sang to her the tenderest <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. The Panagia of the <a href="../cathen/03096a.htm">Byzantines</a>, the Virgin of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, Throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Queen of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, gave place to the Mother, the most beautiful, the sweetest, and the tenderest of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. After <a href="../cathen/02498d.htm">St. Bernard</a> &mdash; <em>il suo fedele Bernardo</em>&mdash; <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a>, devotion to the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Madonna</a> became one of the chief <a href="../cathen/12275b.htm">Christian devotions</a>. Schools competed as to which should paint the holiest and most exquisite Virgins, and none were more charming than those of <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> &mdash; <em>Sena vetus civitas virginis</em>.

<p>The Madonnas of <a href="../cathen/09730d.htm">Simone di Martino</a>, of the two <a href="../cathen/09357c.htm">Lorenzetti</a>, of Lippo Memmi, and their successors began the incomparable poem to which <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, <a href="../cathen/05220b.htm">Van Dyck</a>, or <a href="../cathen/10644a.htm">Murillo</a> added perfect strophes, without, however, obliterating the memory of their ancient predecessors.

<p>The same inspiration is evident in the paintings which represent the moral, didactic, or philosophic painting of that time, such as the frescoes of "Good and Evil Government" at <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09357c.htm">Lorenzetti</a> (c. 1340), those of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> militant and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> teaching in the Spanish Chapel (c. 1355), or those of the "Anchorites" and the "Triumph of Death" in the Campo Santo of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> (c. 1370), all showing the same popular and practical character. Such pictures have the force of a sermon; there is no strictly artistic intention, but an obvious intention to instruct and impress.

<p>This is also made clear by the celebrated allegories of the <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Virtues, in the <a href="../cathen/04558a.htm">lower church</a> of <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> (c. 1335) and in the frequent repetition of the <a href="../cathen/08552a.htm">Last Judgment</a> (by <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a> at Padua and the Florence Signoria; by <a href="../cathen/11275b.htm">Orcagna</a> at S. Maria Novella, etc.). This theme of death and the Judgment was evidently a favourite one with the Mendicants: at <a href="../cathen/01801a.htm">Assisi</a> and Padua are two frescoes representing a <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friar Minor</a> indicating a skeleton beside him. And hence the "Triumph of Death" at <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> and the terrible <a href="../cathen/04617a.htm">"Dance of Death"</a> of northern <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>.

<p>This popular art required popular modes of expression. Cavallini and <a href="../cathen/06565a.htm">Giotto</a> still made <a href="../cathen/10584a.htm">mosaics</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03771a.htm">Cimabue</a> is best known to us as a mosaicist. But this slow and expensive method was unsuited to a democratic, sentimental, and impassioned art, while fresco, which had never been abandoned even during the Byzantine period, offered to the new <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> a more plastic and animated mode of expression. With less material opulence, the latter process was rapid, cheap and apt at reproducing the undulations of life, expressing at once the exactness of nature and the emotion of the artist. Thereby a new element entered into the execution itself, an individual element of sentiment and spontaneity only limited by the conditions of mural painting and the exigencies of an art always somewhat oratorical. Inebriated, as it were, with this new liberty, the Giottesque painters covered <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> with innumerable paintings. Indeed, this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, as a whole, despite grave faults, constitutes the richest and freest fund of religious painting.

<p><em>(2) Masaccio and His Age</em>

<p>But it must be acknowledged that the Giottesques formed a popular <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which was too often satisfied with worthless improvisation. The task of imbuing painting with artistic feeling was that of the two great painters, <a href="../cathen/09769a.htm">Masolino</a> and <a href="../cathen/09768a.htm">Masaccio</a>, the latter especially, in his frescoes in the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> at Florence (1426) sounding the keynote of the future. Nevertheless, despite their seriousness of conception and aim, the <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religious</a> element of these frescoes is scarcely to be taken into account. There are evidences of great progress in the art, the nobility of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, the elevation of style, the seriousness and grandeur of the work, but the gain of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> feeling and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is less manifest. But, <a href="../cathen/09768a.htm">Masaccio's</a> powerful naturalness was for a time in harmony with the mystic sense, and <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">religious art</a> then yielded perhaps its most exquisite flowers. The works of <a href="../cathen/06421a.htm">Gentile da Fabriano</a>, such as the "Adoration of the Magi" (1423; Academy of Florence), those of Pisanello, such as the "Legend of St. George" (c. 1425; St. Anastasia, <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a>), and in a lesser degree those of the <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> Stefano da Zevio breathe the inimitable grace of a pure and holy <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, which is still more charmingly apparent in the works of the <a href="../cathen/03204d.htm">Camaldolese</a> Lorenzo Monaco, and especially in those of the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> Fra Giovanni da Fiesole, whose genius won for him the surname of <a href="../cathen/01483b.htm">Angelico</a>.

<p><a href="../cathen/01483b.htm">Angelico's</a> disciples did not reach his level, but a youthful charm distinguishes the spiritual paintings of <a href="../cathen/06688b.htm">Benozzo Gozzoli</a>, whose "Adoration of the Magi" in the Riccardi <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a> is one of the most perfect works of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. while his "Genesis" frescoes in the Campo Santo of <a href="../cathen/12110a.htm">Pisa</a> (1469-85) will always be <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> for their exquisite figures amid rich landscapes. But perhaps this <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> never inspired anything more lovable than the works of the old Umbrian masters Ottaviano Nelli, Allegretto Nuzi, Domenico Bonfigli, and Boccati da Camerino. The early <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> was a fortunate period, in which the simplicity of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was not marred by the discovery of nature and art. Even the poor <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite</a>, <a href="../cathen/09278a.htm">Fra Filippo Lippi</a>, unwilling <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> as he was, whose restless life was far from exemplary, was animated by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and delicate <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. His "Nativity" (Berlin), his "Madonna" (Uffizi), and his "Adoration of the Holy Child" (c. 1465, Louvre) recall <a href="../cathen/01483b.htm">Angelico</a>.
<h3 id="C">The fifteenth century in the north</h3>

<p>What <a href="../cathen/09768a.htm">Masaccio's</a> frescoes were for fifteenth-century <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, that and much more was the retable of the <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">Van Eycks</a> for the rest of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. This colossal work was begun in 1420, completed and set up in 1432. Throughout the fifteenth century the art of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of the North retained the allegorical and symbolical character which marks this great work. Such books as the "Speculum humanae salvationis" or the "Biblia pauperum" dominated iconography and furnished artists with their favourite subjects. But, with all this, in <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flanders</a> <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a> was unrestrained, that of the <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">van Eycks</a> making even <a href="../cathen/09768a.htm">Masaccio's</a> seem vague and abstract. A portion of the change accomplished by them is foreshadowed in the works of the Limbourgs (see <a href="../cathen/09259a.htm">POL DE LIMBOURG</a>). To the revolution which they effected in the manner of beholding corresponds another in the manner of painting. The whole fifteenth century spoke of the "invention of the <a href="../cathen/05732a.htm">van Eycks</a>": it is hard to say in what this consisted, but if they did not, as was believed, discover oil-painting. they certainly invented new processes and a new style. Undoubtedly this realism lacked taste and charm. The types were common, vulgar and middle-class, and these faults were even exaggerated by the disciples of the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> &mdash; Jean Daret, Ouwater, Dirck Bouts, Van der Goes, and Petrus Cristus. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school's</a> photographic impassability, on the other hand, was suddenly offset by the equally exaggerated and somewhat contorted passion of the Braban&ccedil;on <a href="../cathen/15269c.htm">Van der Weyden</a>, at once a realist and a mystic. Such as it was, this robust, <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> conquered <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> in a few wears, even <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> feeling its powerful influence. In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, Simon Marmion, Nicolas Fremont, and <a href="../cathen/06161b.htm">Jean Fouquet</a> were little more than somewhat refined and gallicized Flemings. In <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> it suffices to mention Luis Dalma&ugrave; and in <a href="../cathen/12297a.htm">Portugal</a>, Nu&ntilde;o Gon&ccedil;alez, both being pure <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a>.

<p>German painting, on the other hand, while it owed much to the neighbouring; <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, remained much more original in spirit. In it is found the deep and tender sentiment lacking in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the Low Countries, a popular <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a> derived, not from books, but from the interior treasures of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which produced (c. 1380) the <em>Clarenaltar</em> of Cologne and (c. 1400) the delightful little "Paradise" of <a href="../cathen/06237a.htm">Frankfort</a> obviously possessed but mediocre gifts; its sense of form Bas often defective, but even the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of <a href="../cathen/01483b.htm">Angelico</a> did not speak a purer language. A superior plastic <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> produced the work of <a href="../cathen/09319c.htm">Stephan Lochner</a>, the fine <em>Dombild</em> (1430), the "Madonna of the Violet", and the marvellously sweet "Madonna of the Rose Garden". From this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was descended the most famous of the Northern mystics, the tender and graceful <a href="../cathen/10172c.htm">Memling</a>. In his work a new aristocracy, that of sentiment, transfigures the <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> opulence. The same moral delicacy and familiarity with Divine things sweeten and spiritualize the works of Gerard David, and especially of <a href="../cathen/10037c.htm">Quentin Massys</a>, who became a painter through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. At the end of the fifteenth century there was no German town or province which had not its local <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. For a long time only two of these were known or regarded: that of Cologne, with its anonymous masters, the Master of the Passion of Lyversberg, the Master of the Death of Mary, the Master of the Holy Family (<em>Heiligensippe</em>) and, most powerful of all the Master of the <em>Bartholom&auml;usaltar</em>; and the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of <a href="../cathen/11168a.htm">Nuremberg</a>, with its two famous painters, Wohlgemuth and Pleydenwurff. But in reality no corner of Franconia, Suabia, Alsace, or the Tyrol remained sterile. It was a popular art, localized sentiments and extremely incorrect, often coarse in form, but refined in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> even to affectation, and which in its <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> imagery expressed better than any other certain <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of sympathy and tenderness. There is nothing more thrilling than the Passion of Hans Multescher nor more appealing than the altarpiece of <a href="../cathen/15682b.htm">St. Wolfgang</a> by the Tyrolese Michel Pacher. Elsewhere in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> there were other admirable stylists, such as <a href="../cathen/02220b.htm">Hans Baldung</a> and Conrad Witz at <a href="../cathen/06302a.htm">Fribourg</a> and Basle, foreshadowing the perfection of <a href="../cathen/07385a.htm">Holbein</a>.

<p>But the great <a href="../cathen/05209c.htm">Albrecht D&uuml;rer</a> was to express all that was most intimate in Germanic religion, and beautiful as were his pictures he expressed the deepest meanings in his prints. This more direct and less expensive art produced for the masses, satisfied the German demands for popularity and individuality. To this <a href="../cathen/05209c.htm">D&uuml;rer's</a> genius was wholly devoted, and art does not possess more moving masterpieces than the "Apocalypse" series (1498), the "Life of the Blessed Virgin" (1506), the "Little Passion" (1509), and the Great Passion" (1510). But side by side with this contemplative, intimate, and noble spiritual art was a second tendency, no less thoughtfully but impassioned, violent, dramatic, and which went to extremes in the search for expression and the mania for the pathetic. It was inspired by the <a href="../cathen/10348a.htm">mystery plays</a>. All technical progress and perfection of realization were utilized to express emotion. It began with <a href="../cathen/15269c.htm">Van der Weyden</a>, <a href="../cathen/10172c.htm">Memling</a> did not escape it in his <a href="../cathen/10631a.htm">Munich</a> picture of the "Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin", <a href="../cathen/10037c.htm">Massys</a> painted blood-besprinkled Holy Faces and Magdalens with reddened and streaming eyes, <a href="../cathen/05209c.htm">D&uuml;rer's</a> "Passions" terrify by their intensity of sorrow, but the most tragic of all was Mathias Gri&uuml;newald, whose terrible "Crucifixions" at Colmar and Stuttgart are like the nightmare of a barbarian visionary. This <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the horrible became a genre. Infernal fantasies, the dreams of an unhealthy <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a>, haunt the thoughts of Jerome Bosch, while, on the other hand, idyllic insipidity and childishness appear in the "Holy Family" and "Flight into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>" of Cranach and Patenier. At this juncture came the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>, which destroyed painting in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>.
<h2 id="section4">The <em>cinquecento</em> and the later schools</h2>
<h3 id="A">Tuscany, Umbria, and Rome</h3>

<p>The two tendencies observed in the North, <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a> and pathos, developed also in contemporary <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> criticism has greatly exaggerated the irreligion of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>. Undoubtedly some painters, absorbed by problems of expression and the study of atmosphere, models, and perspective, neglected religious emotions. At Florence especially there mere a number of artists who saw in their craft only a question of form. Form, as a matter of fact, owes much of its progress to the studies of <a href="../cathen/03407d.htm">Castagno</a>, <a href="../cathen/15117c.htm">Paolo Uccello</a>, the Pollaiuoli, Andrea Verrocchio, and <a href="../cathen/02219c.htm">Baldovinetti</a> but their learning, importance, and great services cannot conceal the poverty of their art and the narrowness of their <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>; they were professors and useful pedagogues, but neither poets nor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> artists. On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> was the period when the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, so unnatural to Italian thought, manifested itself by most important works. The decoration of the Sistine Chapel (c. 1480) at the command of a <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, is perhaps the most clearly symbolical assemblage of Italian art. On the walls the life of Moses is portrayed parallel with that of Christ. Thirty years later <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a> depicted on the ceiling the Delivery of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. the Prophets, the Sibyls, and the Ancestors of Christ. The Appartamento Borgia was decorated by <a href="../cathen/12103b.htm">Pinturicchio</a> with didactic frescoes in imitation of the <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> <a href="../cathen/03574b.htm">chapel</a>; <a href="../cathen/09277a.htm">Filippino Lippi</a> represented at the Minerva the "Triumph of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas Aquinas</a>"; while <a href="../cathen/11737b.htm">Perugino</a> at the Cambio of <a href="../cathen/11736a.htm">Perugia</a> and <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> in his stanze produced the masterpieces of the painting of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>.

<p>It would be vain to deny that the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> possessed irreligious tendencies. Certainly such a work as that of <a href="../cathen/06545a.htm">Ghirlandajo</a> in the choir of S. Maria Novella is singularly secular in tone. Even in more serious works, such as Leonardo's wonderful "Last Supper" at <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, it is readily seen that despite its sublime beauty it was not intended merely to edify. However, these matters must be treated with reserve, owing to the delicate nature of questions of religious sincerity. We can hardly assert that the <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominicans</a> for whom these works were executed were poorer judges than we, nor is it clear by what right we connect religious meaning with certain archaic forms. In this the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has judged with more delicacy, never having restricted a sentiment to certain forms but, having left it free to errata that most fitting to it and to speak to each age the language which will be best understood. The fact is that at no period was religious artistry so fruitful; no other has bequeathed to us so many <a href="../cathen/01356a.htm">altarpieces</a>, oratory pictures, Madonnas and <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. It was the age of countless pictures for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> confraternities, and it is quite probable that the artist, who was so often a member of the confraternity, infused something of his heart into his work. At <a href="../cathen/13779a.htm">Siena</a> especially such charming painters as <a href="../cathen/15317c.htm">Vecchietta</a> or Benvenuto di Giovanni were no less remarkable for their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> than their talents. <a href="../cathen/11737b.htm">Perugino</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, has been called an <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">Atheist</a>, but of this we have no <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a>, nor do we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari's</a> authority for the statement. On the other hand we note in him (before he lapsed into mechanical production) a reaction against dryness and intellectualism. (See <a href="../cathen/11737b.htm">PERUGINO</a>.) <a href="../cathen/02708b.htm">Botticelli</a> and <a href="../cathen/09277a.htm">Filippino Lippi</a> show a tendency to the nervous pathos of <a href="../cathen/15269c.htm">Roger Van der Weyden</a> and <a href="../cathen/10037c.htm">Quentin Massys</a>. An extremely ascetic and terrifying spirit distinguishes <a href="../cathen/13787a.htm">Luca Signorelli</a>.

<p>More worthy of study are the works of <a href="../cathen/04509a.htm">Crivelli</a> and Cosimo Tura at <a href="../cathen/15360a.htm">Verona</a> and <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a>, showing a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for depicting suffering which borders on caricature. At Bologna, on the other hand, the productions of <a href="../cathen/04417b.htm">Costa</a> and Francia are marked by a more temperate religious emotion, while a group of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milanese</a> painters including Foppa and <a href="../cathen/02685b.htm">Borgognone</a> upheld, even amid Leonardo's influence, the mystical traditions of the ancient <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>. The appearance of new motifs based on devotion to the Precious Blood, to the Holy Family, the maternity of the Blessed Virgin, etc., indicated the continuous enriching of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a> and the constant activity of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Undoubtedly when Leonardo painted the "St. Anne" of the Louvre and <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> his "Madonna of the Goldfinch", they did not aim at portraying ascetic <a href="../cathen/10578b.htm">mortification</a> but rather a serene confidence in the beauty and nobility of life. It is difficult to stamp this optimism as an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.
<h3 id="B">Venice and the schools of northern Italy</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> has been greatly misjudged from a religious standpoint. Because the <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a> could paint better than any others, and because they set great value on the charm of colouring, they have been charged with <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> and immorality. Quite the contrary is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Two very different traditions are evident in <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetian</a> painting: the first that of the popular painters employed by the confraternities, the guilds, and the <em>scuole</em>; the other that of the official painters in the service of the State, the patricians, and the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convents</a>. The former <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, which was that of Lazzaro Bastiani, <a href="../cathen/03373c.htm">Carpaccio</a>, <a href="../cathen/03772a.htm">Cima da Conegliano</a>, and Diana, filled the <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parishes</a> of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> and the Islands with brilliant and delightfully ingenuous works. Nothing could be more charming than <a href="../cathen/03373c.htm">Carpaccio's</a> paintings, such as his Legend of <a href="../cathen/15225d.htm">St. Ursula</a> or the oratory pictures in San Giorgio de' Schiavoni. The second and more scholarly <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a>, proceeding from the <a href="../cathen/15491b.htm">Vivarini</a> and the great Paduan master, <a href="../cathen/09610a.htm">Andrea Mantegna</a>, is chiefly represented by the three Bellini, the last of whom, Giovanni, is not only one of the most beautiful of painters but also one of the most elevated and recollected. The works of <a href="../cathen/06564c.htm">Giorgione</a> are no less poetically inspired, and his heads of Christ are marvels of emotion. It may be questioned how <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a> can be charged with irreligion in his "Assumption", his <a href="../cathen/11738b.htm">Pesaro</a> Madonna, his "Martyrdom of St. Lawrence", his frescoes in the Santo of Padua, or his "Death of St. Peter Martyr". In his "Bacchanal" of <a href="../cathen/09516a.htm">Madrid</a> and the "Flora" of the Uffizi we encounter the same problem presented by <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, which then faced all cultured <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a>. We can scarcely accuse of religious insincerity the author of the "Entombment" and "Crowning with Thorns" of the Louvre, who after so many <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyous</a> pictures painted as his last testament and farewell to life the funereal "Pieta" of the Accademia of <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. The same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the other great <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venetians</a>, Palma, <a href="../cathen/03169b.htm">Veronese</a>, Bonifazio, Tintoretto, and the divine Corregio.

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> by harsh criticism to be vigilant with regard to <a href="../cathen/07538b.htm">humanistic</a> extremes. At Florence the work of <a href="../cathen/02318a.htm">Fra Bartolommeo</a> or Andrea del Sarto, at <a href="../cathen/06046a.htm">Ferrara</a> that of <a href="../cathen/14739b.htm">Garofalo</a>, at <a href="../cathen/02760a.htm">Brescia</a> that of <a href="../cathen/02678b.htm">Moretto</a> or Romanino, at <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a> that of <a href="../cathen/06047a.htm">Gaudenzio Ferrari</a>, at <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> itself that of <a href="../cathen/09367a.htm">Lorenzo Lotto</a>. are so many heralds of a "counter-reformation", which be came definite about 1550, at the time of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>, and which derived its origin from <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>. A significant circumstance was the action of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> against <a href="../cathen/03169b.htm">Veronese</a> for having introduced fanciful figures into his religious pictures. The painter was acquitted, but the art of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> had received a blow from which it never recovered. It was the period when the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> ordered <a href="../cathen/15504a.htm">Daniele di Volterra (Ricciarelli)</a> to clothe decently the too audacious nakedness of his "Last Judgment", when the learned Molanus (Meulen) wrote his work on images, when <a href="../cathen/03619a.htm">St. Charles Borromeo</a> and <a href="../cathen/02688b.htm">his cousin the cardinal</a>, with their circle of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> associates preached a return to an enlightened, serious religion, purified of popular <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstitions</a> and recovered from the dangerous compromise with the external forms of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a>. After having exercised great toleration the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was about to take vigorously in hand the direction of <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. Tintoretto's last works at the Scuola di S. Rocco display a system of symbols as abstract as a <a href="../cathen/14241a.htm">stained-glass</a> window of the thirteenth century; painting once more became the handmaid of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. From <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a> itself came the last Byzantine, the strange <a href="../cathen/14628a.htm">Greco</a>, the pupil of <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a> and <a href="../cathen/03169b.htm">Veronese</a>, whose emaciated, sickly, dried-up style is a protest against the whole luxuriant ideal of the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, and who became the founder of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spanish</a> painting.
<h3 id="C">The Baroque school</h3>

<p>The most striking trait of the new <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was its unity of style and method. In the fifteenth and even in the sixteenth century there was an endless number of little <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, each town having its own, but in the seventeenth century painting once more became international. A single manner of seeing and thinking predominated and there was no essential difference between a <a href="../cathen/06094b.htm">Flemish</a> and an Italian or Spanish picture. More than one social or political season may be advanced for this, e.g., the political supremacy of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and the establishment of the Viceroyalty of <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, or the cosmopolitanism of the painters. But the only good reason was the existence of a general organization, a universal institute which forced a common direction on all <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>. But the time has gone by when the word baroque was used to disparage two centuries of art, as the word Gothic thinly disguised a condemnation. What <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> is to the modern world the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of beauty Was to sixteenth century <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. Thus the lost Grecian ideal was restored through Florence and <a href="../cathen/15333a.htm">Venice</a>, but the cultivation of the form without thought for its import was what dried up and poisoned the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> which issued from <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a> and especially from <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a>, the art of <a href="../cathen/06572a.htm">Giulio Romano</a>, Zuccheri, <a href="../cathen/15274a.htm">Vasari</a>, and Giuseppino. Before the end of the century a strong reaction set in against this corrupt and empty art. In 1582 the <a href="../cathen/03374c.htm">Carracci</a> founded their academy at Bologna. and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, about the same time, the independent and eccentric <a href="../cathen/10569b.htm">Caravaggio</a> <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandalized</a> the public by brutal painting roughly borrowed from the lowest reality. In his "Death of the Blessed Virgin" (c. 1605) now at the Louvre he did not hesitate to copy a drowned <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Nevertheless <a href="../cathen/10569b.htm">Caravaggio</a> did much to turn art once more in the direction of nature and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. His "Entombment" at the Vatican, is one of the important works of modern painting and the manifestation of a new art.

<p>Thus, of its own volition, art inclined to return to <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a> while religion endeavoured to hold it back. <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius</a> in his "Spiritual Exercises" indicates the share of sentiment and <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> in the <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychology</a> of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, laying great stress on the "composition of place" and the use of the senses as aids to the <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagination</a> with the object of arousing an emotion. It will readily be seen what, assistance painting would be to such a system, and that is why the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuits</a> restored to art all the importance which the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> had taken from it. <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">Naturalism</a> was the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> result of this spirit, and in this <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> art merely resumed the constant tradition of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. Nor was this all; the picture should inspire emotion, and the corollary of <a href="../cathen/10713a.htm">naturalism</a> was pathos. By more than one characteristic the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the seventeenth century recalls the great <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of the fourteenth. A curious fact is the recurrence of popularity of <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> legend. The "Vision of St. Francis", the "Stigmata", the "Vision of St. Anthony of Padua", the "Last Communion of <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>" are the titles of masterpieces in the <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> of <a href="../cathen/01588e.htm">Antwerp</a>, Bologna, <a href="../cathen/10683a.htm">Naples</a>, and Seville. A still more significant circumstance was that the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a>, like the ancient Byzantine art, had avoided all portrayal of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">sufferings of Christ</a>: <a href="../cathen/12640c.htm">Raphael</a>, <a href="../cathen/14742a.htm">Titian</a>, or <a href="../cathen/03059b.htm">Michelangelo</a> never painted a Crucifixion, though among the masterpieces of <a href="../cathen/13214c.htm">Rubens</a> were an "Ascent of Calvary" an "Erection of the Cross", a "Piercing with the Lance", and a "Descent from the Cross". The <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> had also lost the taste for and the sense of narrative; but the art of the seventeenth century presents numerous examples of this ability restored such as the "Life of St. Cecilia" at S. Luigi di Francesi and the "Life of St. Nilus" at <a href="../cathen/07040b.htm">Grottaferrata</a>, by <a href="../cathen/05102b.htm">Domenichino</a>; the Lives of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> and <a href="../cathen/11770b.htm">St. Peter Nolasco</a> by <a href="../cathen/15770a.htm">Zurbaran</a>, etc. The Gospel and the "Legenda aurea" were restored to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. If the <a href="../cathen/12765b.htm">Renaissance</a> had been a retrogression or an eclipse of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sentiment, Baroque art was a real resurrection.
<h2 id="section5">Modern religious painting</h2>

<p>Great religious painting ends with <a href="../cathen/14723a.htm">Tiepolo</a>; his Spanish imitators, Baye and Goya, produced charming works, but did nothing new. Save for a few somewhat touching works of Lesueur the classic French <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> was wholly lacking in religious originality. Philippe de Champagne was a Fleming, a good painter whose talent <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenism</a> almost destroyed. New theories and the spirit of the eighteenth century struck a fatal blow against the painting of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. To the admirers of extreme antiquity such as <a href="../cathen/15650a.htm">Winckelmann</a> and Lessing, and their disciple, Diderot, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> was an inferior religion which had diffused an unworthy system of &aelig;sthetics throughout the world. <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> painting was dominated by a sort of artistic Jacobinism. David and his <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> produced no religious painting; under the Empire the only "Christ" worthy of mention is that of the gentle Prud'hon. However a curious reaction followed this arid fanaticism; the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> began to be understood. Even under the Directory and in David's studio there was a small body calling themselves the "Primitifs". <a href="../cathen/03640a.htm">Chateaubriand's</a> "Genius of Christianity" was published on the same day as the Concordat of 1802. At <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a little circle of German artists, weary of Goethe's Hellenic <a href="../cathen/12652a.htm">rationalism</a>, returned to <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mysticism</a>, discovered <a href="../cathen/06221a.htm">St. Francis of Assisi</a>, and by painting reopened the sources of the moral life. Unfortunately these "Nazarenes", <a href="../cathen/11362a.htm">Overbeck</a>, <a href="../cathen/14285a.htm">Steinle</a>, and the rest, had but a poor artistic sense. A <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">Frenchman</a>, <a href="../cathen/08008b.htm">Jean Dominique Ingres</a>, had better success and endowed with life his "Bestowal of the Keys" (1820), his "Vow of Louis XIII" (1824), his "St. Symphorian" (1834), and some of his Virgins.

<p>Other painters also treated religious subjects: the <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> Ary Scheffer, <a href="../cathen/04691a.htm">Paul Delaroche</a>, even Decamps. But the only one who succeeds in arousing emotion is Paul Delacroix, whose "Christ on Mt. Olivet" (1827), "Descent from the Cross" (1834), "Good <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>" at <a href="../cathen/09611b.htm">Mantua</a>, "Christ Stilling the Tempest", and especially his Chapel of the Angels in the <a href="../cathen/03041a.htm">church</a> of St. Sulpice, are examples of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> passion and poetry. With <a href="../cathen/06096a.htm">Flandrin's</a> frescoes may be mentioned those of Victor Mottoz at St. Germain l'Auxerrois, of Chass&eacute;riau at <a href="../cathen/13100c.htm">St. Roch</a>, and especially the splendid scenes from the "Legend of St. Genevieve" (1878-98) by <a href="../cathen/12584d.htm">Puvis de Chavannes</a> in the old Pantheon. Henner and L&eacute;on Bonnat have painted famous Christs; Ernest H&eacute;bert has painted Virgins such as that of "The Deliverance" (1872) which are real masterpieces. Some of Bouguereau's are also worthy of mention.

<p>But in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, as elsewhere, religious painting properly so called tends to disappear. The attempts of some sincere painters in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> have had but few imitators. Despite rare merits, the Pre-Raphaelite <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> has left only studied works in which scholarship supersedes sentiment. This is especially <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of Burne-Jones and Rossetti, whose style too often shows affectation and artifice. <a href="../cathen/14741a.htm">James Tissot</a>, with his scrupulous Orientalism, has failed to capture the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Evangelical perfume. The best work of this <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> has been produced by Holman Hunt in his "Scapegoat" and "Shadow of the Cross", which display singular refinement, somewhat hardened by emphasis, but new, impressive, and original. The German Gebhardt does not approach these masterpieces in his "Last Supper" of the Berlin Museum. A <a href="../cathen/06217a.htm">Franciscan</a> Pre-Raphaelitism in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> produced the prints of Charles Marie Dulac and some charming decorations of Maurice Denis, such as his "Assumption" in the church of V&eacute;sinet.

<p>The reason for this impoverishment of <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">religious art</a> must not only be sought in a diminution of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sentiment. It is due primarily to the fact that <a href="../cathen/03710a.htm">religious art</a> has become an industry and concurrence is no longer possible between the artists and the dealers, but the chief reason lies in the very evolution of religious <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a>, which now seek a new form. This has been shown by the painter John La Farge ("Higher Life in Art" 1908). Much of the religious sentiment of the nineteenth century has been expressed in landscape painting. To the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angelic</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Corot painting was always a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of our greatest <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> painter, <a href="../cathen/10310b.htm">Millet</a>, whose peasants naturally assume the appearance of Biblical characters as of the paintings of the same class by L&eacute;on Lhermitte ("Pilgrims of Emmaus", 1894, Boston Museum; "Among the Lowly", 1905, New York Museum), those of L&aacute;rolle, Fritz von Uhde, and especially of Eug&eacute;ne Carri&eacute;re.

<p>Such are the outlines of religious painting during the past 900 years. Ancient <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> expressed every sentiment and ignored no shade of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And if religious painting now seems uncertain, in consideration of the wonderful development of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in some parts of the world, who knows what future still awaits it?
