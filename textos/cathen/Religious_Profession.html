<h1>Religious Profession</h1>  

<h2>Historical view</h2>

<p>Profession may be considered either as a declaration openly made, or as a state of life publicly embraced. The origins of religious profession date from the time when <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were recognized in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as followers after perfection in the practice of <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. We meet them in the third century, under the name of ascetics, called in Greek <em>asketai</em>, and in Latin <em>confessores</em>. <a href="../cathen/05617b.htm">Eusebius</a> (<a href="../fathers/250103.htm"><em>Church History</em> III.37</a>) numbers among the ascetics the most illustrious pontiffs of the first ages, <a href="../cathen/04012c.htm">St. Clement of Rome</a>, <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">St. Ignatius of Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">St. Polycarp</a>, and others. After these, in the fourth century, come the <a href="../cathen/07280a.htm">hermits</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, followed in the eleventh century by the canons regular, in the thirteenth century by the <a href="../cathen/10183c.htm">mendicant orders</a>, in the sixteenth by the clerks regular, and lastly by the members of religious congregations. Profession for a long time was made by clothing with the religious habit: the aspirant could personally put on the habit or receive it, with or without <a href="../cathen/03538b.htm">ceremony</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/01015c.htm">abbot</a> or from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. This clothing laid upon him the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of poverty and chastity more as a natural consequence of a donation or <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecration</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> than as arising from formal <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, which did not exist at that time (cf. <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">St. Basil</a>, Regul&aelig; fusius tractat&aelig; resp. ad 14 interrogat. in P.G., XXXI, 949-52).

<p>The community life, established under Schenoudi, the great disciple of <a href="../cathen/11381a.htm">St. Pachomius</a>, added an explicit promise of fidelity to certain <a href="../cathen/12372b.htm">precepts</a>. St. Benedict added an express promise of stability, and obedience to the superior. These last promises denoted <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> created in addition to those implied by taking the habit. The first formula, which expressly mentions poverty and chastity, is that of the Constitutions of Narbonne, <a href="../cathen/12454b.htm">promulgated</a> in 1260 by <a href="../cathen/02648c.htm">St. Bonaventure</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a>; then the constitutions of the Minims and clerks regular expressly mention the three essential <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, as well as those which were superadded on account of the special ends of their orders. This discipline is common to <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders and congregations. Finally the regulations (Norm&aelig;) of 1901, published in explanation of the present practice of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, do not permit in new congregations any but the three essential <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty, chastity, and obedience.

<p>In the <a href="../cathen/04670b.htm">Decretal</a>, "Quod votum," unic. De veto et voti redemptione (iii, 15) in 6&#176;, <a href="../cathen/02662a.htm">Boniface VIII</a> declared authoritatively that the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of chastity, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the reception of major orders, or by religious profession in an approved institute, created a diriment impediment to marriage. Some communities of tertiaries not belonging to an approved order were the first to introduce profession accompanied by simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, which is now the ordinary practice in the more recent congregations.

<p>The Annals of the Order of St. Benedict (vol. I, p. 74) in the year 537 recognized among the Greeks three classes of religious: the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a>, who wore the simple tunic; the perfect, clothed with the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>; and the more perfect invested with the <em>cuculla</em>, or hood attached to a short cloak, covering the shoulders, which was considered the special emblem of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. In certain <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of the East, a distinction was made between <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> wearing the short habit, <em>mikroschemoi</em>, and those wearing the long habit, <em>megaloschemoi</em>, a distinction against which St. Theodorus the Studite protested in his epistles (I, ep. x, in P.G., XCIX, 941-2) and which is still found among the Schismatic <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Coptic</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> (see Kathol. Missionen 1 Oct., 1910, p. 7 sqq.). <a href="../cathen/07639c.htm">St. Ignatius of Loyola</a> laid down that in his order there should be a simple profession, followed by more or less frequent renewal of <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> until such time as the candidate should be prepared for the solemn or definitive profession; this under <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> and <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> has become the <a href="../cathen/09068a.htm">common law</a> of all <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders.
<h2>Existing law</h2>
<h3>Definition</h3>

<p>According to the existing law, religious profession denotes the act of embracing the religious state by the three <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of poverty, chastity, and obedience according to the rule of an order canonically approved; it involves then a triple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and binding oneself to the rule of a certain order. Very often the rules or constitutions of an order or congregation (approved before the Norm&aelig; of 1901) add to these essential <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> certain special <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> inspired by the purpose of the order: thus the <a href="../cathen/06281a.htm">Friars Minor</a> make a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of special obedience to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>; the <a href="../cathen/12251b.htm">Poor Clares</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of enclosure; the <a href="../cathen/10197b.htm">Mercedarians</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of devoting themselves to the <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> captives, even giving themselves as hostages; the Minims, a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of strict abstinence; the <a href="../cathen/03354a.htm">Carmelite Sisters</a> and discalced Augustinians, a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humility</a>; the first profession in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> implies a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of indifference in regard to final <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, i.e. whether they be solemn or simple; the solemn profession adds a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of obedience to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> for missions, and five simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> in order the better to ensure the observance of poverty, and the eschewal of <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>; the <a href="../cathen/02802b.htm">Brothers of St. John of God</a> make a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to serve the sick; the <a href="../cathen/13588a.htm">Clerks Regular of the Pious Schools</a>, a solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educate</a> children, and also three simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> relating to poverty and the shunning of <a href="../cathen/01381d.htm">ambition</a>; the religious of Penitence (Scalzetti), a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> to defend the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of the Immaculate Conception; the <a href="../cathen/11521d.htm">Passionists</a>, to promote devotion to the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion of Our Lord</a>; the <a href="../cathen/08056a.htm">Brothers of the Christian Schools</a>, <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> of stability and of gratuitous <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of children; the <a href="../cathen/12248a.htm">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vow</a> of hospitality.


<h3>Division</h3>

<p>Profession was express, when made with the usual ceremonies; tacit, or implied, when the reciprocal engagement between the order and the religious was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by outward acts; it was sufficient for this purpose to wear the habit of the professed members for some time openly and without objection being made in any one. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> abolished the tacit solemn profession for <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders (11 June, 1858) and it has fallen into disuse altogether.

<p>Profession is either simple or solemn. Solemn profession exists at present only in the institutes approved by the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> as <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders. It is always perpetual, and <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from it is difficult to obtain; a religious who has been dismissed from his order is still bound by the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>; the same is the case with one who obtains from the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> the <a href="../cathen/07789a.htm">indult</a> of perpetual secularization; professed who have left their order owe to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">diocese</a> in which they reside the obedience which they formerly owed to their religious superior. Solemn profession implies a reciprocal engagement between the religious and his order, which undertakes to maintain him, and treat him as a member of its household; except in case of special privilege, it can dismiss a professed religious in canonical form only for incorrigible persistence in some grave public fault. The professed religious who is dismissed is <em>ipso facto</em> suspended, and the suspension is reserved to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> (see the recent <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">decree</a> "Cum singul&aelig;" of 16 May, 1911). According to existing law, solemn profession annuls a marriage previously contracted, but not yet consummated, and creates a diriment impediment to any future marriage; and also renders the professed religious incapable, without the permission of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, of acquiring or of possessing and disposing of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>. In <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, and probably in <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>, profession no longer involves this disability.

<p>Simple profession is sometimes perpetual and sometimes temporary, and therefore imperfect. At the end of a term of temporary profession, a religious is free to go back to the world, and the order has power to dismiss one who has not shown himself worthy to renew his profession, or to make a subsequent profession; but a physical infirmity which was caused after the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, or the cause of which was known at the time of the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, does not justify the dismissal of a religious against his will. In congregations which have no solemn <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> ordinarily prescribes a term of temporary <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, varying from three to six years, before the perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. There are however some congregations, such as the Nuns of the Sacred Heart in which all the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are perpetual; and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">societies</a> without perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, such as the <a href="../cathen/03605a.htm">Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul</a>; or even without <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, like the Missionaries of Africa, or <a href="../cathen/15613d.htm">White Fathers</a>, who have only an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> of obedience. The <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a> insists that on the expiration of temporal <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, these should be either renewed or converted into perpetual <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, as the case may be, without allowing any interval of time, during which the religious would be free from his <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>.

<p>Simple profession sometimes is a preparation for solemn profession, and sometimes has a distinct character of its own. In all <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, three years at least of simple profession are a <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> condition for the validity of solemn profession (see <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">NUNS</a>), and for <a href="../cathen/09093a.htm">lay brothers</a>, six years of simple profession and an age of at least thirty years are required (<a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of 1 Jan 1911) This time of simple profession may be considered as a second term of probation; it is not difficult for the religious to obtain a <a href="../cathen/05041a.htm">dispensation</a> from his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, and, on the other hand, the order may dismiss him for any grave cause of dissatisfaction, the sufficiency of which is left to the judgment of the superior. The dismissal of <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>, however, requires the consent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>; religious with simple or even temporary <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, who have received major orders in their institute, are in the same position, in regard to dismissal, as those who have made their final profession. Generally speaking, simple profession does not prevent a religious from retaining or acquiring <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>; the administration and disposition of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> alone are forbidden. Except in the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Society of Jesus</a> it is no longer a diriment impediment to marriage, and it never annuls a marriage already contracted.
<h3>Conditions of validity and form</h3>

<p>It is essential in all cases for the validity of a religious profession that the candidate should be at least sixteen years of age and have passed one year in the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a>. Persons who, under the provisions of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Ecclesia Christi" of 7 September, 1909, cannot be validly admitted to the <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> without the consent of the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>, cannot without the same consent make a valid profession. Admission to profession, especially to the first, is generally decided by the chapter. Profession made or permitted under duress is null and void; and the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a> passes sentence of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> on all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who compel a young girl to enter a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> by solemn profession, or who forcibly prevent her from doing so. Although tacit profession, which has been expressly abolished for <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders, has fallen into disuse everywhere, no particular rite or formula of profession is essential, unless distinctly required by the constitutions. A general <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the Sacred Congregation of Rites of 14-27 August, 1874, indicates the manner in which profession should be made during Mass. Since the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Auctis admodum", simple but perpetual profession creates the same bond between the religious and the congregation as solemn profession does in a <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> order. Such a religious can be dismissed only for incorrigible persistence in some grave public fault. Even when congregations with simple <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> have the power to dismiss a religious, they have not the power to dispense him from his <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>: this is strictly reserved to the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Holy See</a>.
<h3>Common effects of profession</h3>

<p>Every perpetual profession admits one to the religious state and consequently creates an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to aspire after perfection. This <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> is sufficiently fulfilled by observing the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> and rules, so far as they bind the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. All previous <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>, provided they do not prejudice the right of a third party, may be changed into religious profession, as into something of a distinctly higher character; and this may be done by the religious himself, or by some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who has power to commute the <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a>. If the profession be solemn, these previous <a href="../cathen/15511a.htm">vows</a> are annulled by canon law. <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">Theologians</a> generally teach that, when made in a state of grace, this absolute surrender of self procures for the religious a remission of all the penalties due to past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The generally accepted opinion, by which religious profession was compared to a new <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, induced <a href="../cathen/12130a.htm">St. Pius V</a> to permit <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novices</a> in houses of <a href="../cathen/12354c.htm">Dominican</a> <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a> to make their profession when in danger of death even before completing their years of <a href="../cathen/11144a.htm">novitiate</a> (Constitution "Summi sacerdotii", 23 August, 1570). This has since been extended to all <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> orders; but restoration to health deprives the profession made under such circumstances of all canonical effects.
