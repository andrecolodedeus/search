<h1>Religious Toleration</h1>  

<p><em>Toleration</em> in general signifies patient forbearance in the presence of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which one is unable or unwilling to prevent. By <em>religious toleration</em> is understood the magnanimous indulgence which one shows towards a religion other than his own, accompanied by the moral determination to leave it and its adherents unmolested in private and public, although internally one views it with complete disapproval as a "false <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>". Since, in this article, we are to treat toleration only from the standpoint of principle, leaving its historical development to be discussed in a <a href="../cathen/14761a.htm">special article</a>, we shall consider:</p>

<blockquote><p>I. The Idea of Toleration; <br>II. The Inadmissibility of Theoretical Dogmatical Toleration; <br>III. The Obligation to Show Practical Civil Toleration; <br>IV. The Necessity of Public Political Toleration.</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="section1">The idea of toleration</h2>

<p>Considered in the abstract, the general <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of toleration contains two chief moments: <ul><li>the existence of something which is regarded as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by the tolerating subject; <li>the magnanimous determination not to interfere with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but to allow it to run its course without molestation.</ul>

<p>Viewed under the former aspect, toleration is akin to patience which also connotes an attitude of forbearance in the face of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Patience, however, is rather the endurance of physical sufferings (e.g. misfortune, sickness), toleration of <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> evils. When not an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> but some real good (e.g. <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or virtue) is in question, toleration gives way to interior <a href="../cathen/01656b.htm">approbation</a> and external promotion of such good. No one will say: "We must show <a href="../cathen/14761a.htm">toleration</a> towards science or patriotism", for both these objects are recognized by all as laudable and desirable. A second <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> akin to toleration is connivance (<em>conniventia, dissimulatio</em>), which means the deliberate closing of one's eyes to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> conditions so as not to be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to take measures against them. The distinction between connivance and toleration lies in the fact that the latter not only closes its eyes to the tolerated <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but also openly concedes it complete liberty of action and freedom to spread. It is indeed in this deliberate granting of liberty that the characteristic quality of toleration lies. For the intolerant <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> also regards what opposes him as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and a source of annoyance; but, it is only by combating it overtly or secretly, that he shows his intolerance. Not all intolerance, however, is a vice, nor is all tolerance a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. On the contrary, an exaggerated tolerance may easily amount to a vice, while intolerance keeping within just limits may be a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. This statement is substantially in agreement with <a href="../cathen/01713a.htm">Aristotle's</a> definition that virtue in general holds the right mean between two extremes which are as such both vices. Thus the intolerance shown by <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> towards grave faults in their children is an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> imposed by <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, although, if it be carried to the extreme of cruelty, it degenerates into a vice. On the other hand, excessive toleration towards an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> becomes under certain circumstances a vice, for example when secular rulers look with folded arms upon public immorality.

<p>The above remarks show that manifold distinctions are <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> before we are in a position to develop the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> principles which underlie real toleration. Viewing our subject partly from the <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> and religious, and partly from the political standpoint, we find three distinct kinds of tolerance and intolerance, which refer to entirely different domains and thus rest on different principles. As regards religious tolerance, which alone concerns us here, we must distinguish especially between the thing and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erring</a>. According as we consider the thing or the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, we have theoretical, dogmatic, or practical civic tolerance, or intolerance. Distinct from both is political tolerance, since the distinction between the individual and the State must also be considered. We must inquire somewhat more closely into these three kinds of tolerance and their opposites before considering the principles which underlie each.

<p>(1) By theoretical dogmatic tolerance is meant the tolerating of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> as such, in so far as it is an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; or, as Lezius concisely expresses it, "the recognition of the relative and subjective right of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to existence" ("Der Toleranzbegriff Lockes u. Puffendorfs", Leipzig, 1900, p. 2). Such a tolerance can only be the outcome of an attitude which is indifferent to the right of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and which places <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> on the same level. In philosophy this attitude is briefly termed scepticism, in the domain of religion, it develops into religious indifferentism which declares that all <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> are equally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and good or equally <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> and bad. Such an internal and external indifference towards all <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a>, especially the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, is nothing else than the expression of personal unbelief and lack of religious convictions. A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who is tolerant in the domain of <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> resembles the botanist who cultivates in his experimental beds both edible plants and poisonous herbs as alike valuable growths, while a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> intolerant of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> may be compared to a market-gardener, who allows only edible plants to grow, and eradicates noxious weeds. Just as vice possesses no real right to existence, whatever toleration may be shown to the vicious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, so also religious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> can lay no just claim to forbearance and indulgence, even though the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erring</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> may merit the greatest affection and esteem. There is, of course, a <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> freedom both to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, but this liberty is not equivalent to an inherent right to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in religion. The "freedom of thought" claimed by <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">free-thinkers</a> is really vitiated by an internal contradiction, since the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is bound by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of thought and must in many cases yield to the force of evidence. But if by freedom of thought we are to understand the personal right of the individual to form on all questions such internal convictions as he may judge right, this <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> freedom also has its limits, since the inner spiritual life is at all events subject to <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and to the moral order of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and is, therefore, bound by <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> which no man may disregard. The so-called "freedom of belief", which asserts the right of each <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> to believe what he pleases, is open to the same criticism. For, if the <a href="../cathen/12545b.htm">psychological</a> liberty to accept the wildest phantasies and the most foolish stories is an undeniable prerogative of the human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> freedom and the <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> right to freedom of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> are nevertheless conditioned by the presumption that a <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> will spurn all <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> and cling solely to that which he has recognized as alone <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and consequently alone legitimate. This <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> was justly emphasized by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Immortale Dei" of 1 November, 1885: "Officium est maximum amplecti et animo et moribus religionem, nec quam quisque maluerit, sed quam Deus jusserit quamque certis minimeque dubitandis indiciis unam ex omnibus veram esse constiterit" (The gravest <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> requires the acceptance and practice, not of the religion which one may choose, but of that which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> prescribes and which is known by certain and indubitable marks to be the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> one). (Cf. Densinger, "Enchiridion", 9th ed., Freiburg, 1900, n. 1701.) The mere description of this kind of tolerance shows that its opposite, i.e. theoretical dogmatic intolerance, cannot be a vice. For it is essentially nothing else than the expression of the objective intolerance of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> towards <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. In the domain of <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alike, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the standard, the aim, and the guide of all investigation; but <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and truthfulness forbid every honourable investigator to countenance <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> or falsehood. It, therefore, follows that well-considered opposition to actual or supposed <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, in whatever domain is simply the antagonism between <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and falsehood translated into personal conviction; as impersonal adversaries, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> are as bitterly opposed to each other as yes and no, and consequently, in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of contradiction, they can tolerate no mean between them. This theoretical dogmatic intolerance &#151; so often misunderstood, so often confounded with other kinds of intolerance, and as a result <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> combated &#151; is claimed by every scholar, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologian</a>, artist, and statesman as an incontestable right, and is unhesitatingly accepted by everyone in daily intercourse.



<p>(2) Practical civic tolerance consists in the personal esteem and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which we are bound to show towards the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erring</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, even though we condemn or combat his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. The motive for this difference of attitude is to be sought in the <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> commandment of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for all men, which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> has raised to the higher ideal of charity or <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of neighbour for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. One of the most beautiful outgrowths of this charity is shown in the correct <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> attitude towards the heterodox. This relation, rooted solely in pure <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, is commonly meant when one speaks of "religious tolerance". It springs, not from pharisaic <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> or from pity pluming itself on its superiority, but chiefly from respect for another's religious convictions, which out of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> charity we do not wish to disturb to no purpose. Since innocent <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> may attain to the firmest and sincerest conviction, the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> does not seem to be greatly imperilled until <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> turns into bad <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in which case alone the feeling of pity has no justification. The <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> of the heterodox <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> must, as a rule, be presumed, until the contrary is clearly established. But even in the extremest cases, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity must never be wounded, since the final judgment on the individual <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> rests with Him who "searches the heart and the reins". The same measure of respect which a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> claims for his religion must be shown by him to the religious convictions of non-Catholics. Here obtains the principle which <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> once recommended in a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> (6 April, 1233), addressed to the <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> concerning the attitude of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> towards the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: "Est autem Jud&aelig;is a Christianis exhibenda benignitas, quam Christianis in Paganismo existentibus cupimus exhiberi" (<a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> must show towards <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> the same good will which we desire to be shown to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> lands). (Cf. Auvray, "Le r&eacute;gistre de Gr&eacute;goire IX", n. 1216.) Whoever claims tolerance must likewise show tolerance. True tolerance in the right place and under the right conditions is one of the most difficult, and also one of the most beautiful and delicate virtues, and in the possession of it the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> greatness of a noble and beautiful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is reflected. To such a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has been communicated, as it were, a spark of the burning charity of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, Who with <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> forbearance tolerates the countless evils of the world, and suffers the cockle to grow with the wheat until the harvest.

<p>The precept of fraternal charity is transgressed by practical civic intolerance, which in more or less detestable fashion transfers intolerance of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erring</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. With complete <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> did the sarcastic Swift write: "In religion many have just enough to make them hate one another, not enough to make them <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another" (cf. J. S. Mackenzie, "An Introduction to Social Philosophy", <a href="../cathen/06577b.htm">Glasgow</a>, 1890, p. 116). The intolerant man is avoided as much as possible by every high-minded <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>, both in <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> and in daily intercourse. The man who is tolerant in every emergency is alone lovable and wins the hearts of his fellowmen. Such tolerance is all the more estimable in one whose loyal practice of his own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> wards off all suspicion of unbelief or <a href="../cathen/07759a.htm">religious indifference</a>, and whose friendly bearing towards the heterodox emanates from pure neighbourly charity and a strict sense of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. It is also an indispensable requisite for the maintenance of friendly intercourse and co-operation among a people composed of different <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious denominations</a>, and is the root of religious peace in the state. It should, therefore, be prized and promoted by the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">civil authorities</a> as a safeguard of the public weal, for a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">warfare</a> of all against all, destructive of the state itself, must again break out (as at the time of the religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and of American <a href="../cathen/08677a.htm">Knownothingism</a>), if citizens be allowed to assail one another on account of religious differences. A <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> who by extensive travel or large experience has become acquainted with the world and men, and with the finer forms of life, does not easily develop into a heretic-hunter, a sadly incongruous figure in the modern world.

<p>(3) Public political tolerance is not a <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of the citizens, but is an affair of the State and of legislation. Its essence consists in the fact that the State grants legal tolerance to all the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">religious denominations</a> within its boundaries, either through its written constitution, through special charters, or at least through prescriptive right based on long tradition. This tolerance may under certain circumstances amount to the principle of equality of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> or parity, even to the full enjoyment of all civil <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>, entirely regardless of one's religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. Since the modern State can and must maintain towards the various <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> and <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> a more broad-minded attitude than the unyielding character of her <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> and constitution permit the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to adopt, it must guarantee to <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> and religious bodies not alone interior freedom of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, but also, as its <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> correlative, to manifest that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> outwardly &#151; that is, the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to profess before the world one's religious convictions without the interference of others, and to give visible expression to these convictions in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, sacrifice, and Divine worship. This threefold freedom of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, profession, and worship is usually included under the general name of religious freedom. Tolerance and religious liberty are not, however, interchangeable terms, since the right implied in state tolerance to grant full or limited religious liberty involves the further right to refuse, to contract, or to withdraw this freedom under certain circumstances, as is clear from the history of toleration <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in every age. Nor is the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of parity identical with that of religious liberty. For the maintenance of a state Church from public funds (e.g. the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Established Church of England</a>) is an offence against parity as regards the dissidents, who must meet their religious needs out of their own means, but it does not affect the general religious liberty, which is enjoyed by the dissidents in the same degree as by the members of the state Church.

<p>Political intolerance finds its harshest expression in the forcible imposition of a religion and its worship, which reached its climax in the drastic political maxim of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> epoch: "Cuius regio, illius et religio". Since external profession and <a href="../cathen/09306a.htm">liturgical</a> worship are but the spontaneous expression of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it is plain that state compulsion in the matter of worship is a grievous attempt to tyrannize over <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and tends to breed <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrisy</a>. Neither political nor <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority can exercise a physical control over interior conviction, since into the secret sanctuary of the mind only the Deity can enter, and He alone can compel the heart. Hence, the principle of <a href="../cathen/09079a.htm">Roman law</a>: "De internis non judicat pr&aelig;tor." But, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and she alone, with her authority to teach and the <a href="../cathen/08631b.htm">power of the keys</a>, may legislate even for <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, she and only she is justified in making a particular <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligatory</a> in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; consequently she may bring to bear upon interior conviction an <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> compulsion, to which corresponds the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to believe on the part of the subject. The State on the other hand cannot extend its <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to religion until this has become visibly embodied in external profession and worship. There are several ways in which the State may interfere. It may either adopt a friendly attitude towards a certain religion and make it the state religion (c. g. the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> religious States, and certain modern States which have established Churches); or it may adopt a hostile attitude towards a certain religion, which it may eventually endeavour to suppress by the employment of force and the infliction of penalties, as e.g. the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Roman Empire tried to suppress <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. But the State may also remain neutral, confining itself to simple tolerance, e.g. as did <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a> and Licinius in the Tolerance Edict of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, A.D. 313. The modern constitutional State adopts as a basic principle, not mere tolerance towards the various religious bodies, but complete religious freedom; this principle finds its truest and most consistent expression in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of America</a>.
<h2 id="section2">The inadmissibility of theoretical dogmatic toleration</h2>

<p>As already said, this kind of tolerance implies indifference towards the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and in principle, a countenancing of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; hence it is clear that intolerance towards <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> as such is among the self-evident <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of every man who recognizes <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>. Inasmuch as this dogmatic intolerance is a prominent characteristic of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and is stigmatized by the modern spirit as obstinacy and even as intolerable arrogance, its objective justification must now be established. We will begin with the incontestable claim of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to universal recognition and exclusive legitimacy. Just as the knowableness of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is the fundamental presupposition of every investigator, so also are its final attainment and possession his goal. Error itself, as the opposite of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is intelligible only when there is an unchangeable norm of cognition by which the thinking mind is ruled. He who sees in the development of human <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">sciences</a> only one vast graveyard containing thousands of tombstones erected over <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, preaches the death of all <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> &#151; that is, the scepticism which was avowed in antiquity by the Middle Academy of Arcesilaus and by later <a href="../cathen/12587a.htm">Greek Pyrrhonism</a>, and which the <a href="../cathen/13516b.htm">sceptics</a> of all the succeeding centuries down to the ingenious Pierre Bayle (d. 1706) have taken for their model. Recent Pragmatism (W. James, Schiller, and others), which denies the eternal, <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a>, and unalterable character of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is only a dreary relapse into the scepticism of the <a href="../cathen/14145c.htm">sophist</a> Protagoras, against which <a href="../cathen/14119a.htm">Socrates</a> raised the banner of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The mutability of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with the passage of time is also a thesis of <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernism</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Lamentabili" of 3 July, 1907, <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> condemned the <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernistic</a> proposition: Veritas non est immutabilis plus quam ipse homo, quippe qu&aelig; cum ipso, in ipso et per ipsum evolvitur (Truth is no more unchangeable than man, since with him, in him, and by him it is evolved). (Cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, "Enchiridion", 11th ed., Freiburg, 1911, n. 2058.) The final consequence of this suicidal system led F. Nietzsche to <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellectual</a> Nihilism: "Nothing is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, everything is allowed." The transference of this destructive scepticism to the domain of religion breeds religious indifferentism, which is no less unreasonable and immoral, since it also <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against the sacredness of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.

<p>Nowhere is dogmatic intolerance so <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> a rule of life as in the domain of religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, since for each individual his <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is at stake. Just as there can be no alternative multiplication tables, so there can be but a single <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, which, by the very fact of its existence, protests against all other <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> as <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> requires each man to stand forth as the incorruptible advocate of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> alone. While abstract <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, both profane and religious, asserts itself victoriously through its impersonal evidence against all opposition, its human advocate, engaging in personal contest with adversaries of flesh and blood like himself, must have recourse to words and writing. Hence the sharp, yet almost impersonal clash between opposing views of life, each of which contends for the palm, because each is thoroughly convinced that it alone is right. But the very devotion to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which supports these convictions determines the kind of polemics which each believes himself called on to conduct. He whose sole concern is for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, will never besmirch his escutcheon by lying or <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> and will refrain from all personal invective. Conscious that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> for which he fights or in <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> believes he fights, is, by reason of its innate nobility, incompatible with any blemish or stain, he will never claim licence to abuse. Such an ideal champion of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is fittingly designated by the English word "gentleman". He may, however, by a fair counter-stroke parry an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, malicious, and insulting attack, since his adversary has no <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to employ invective, to falsify history, to practise sordid proselytism, etc., and may, therefore, be driven without pity from his <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> position. These principles obtain universally and for all men &#151; for scholars and statesmen, for <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>.

<p>If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> also claims the right of dogmatic intolerance with regard to her teaching, it is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> to reproach her for exercising this right. With the imperturbable conviction that she was founded by the God-Man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> as the "pillar and ground of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>" (<a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#vrs15">1 Timothy 3:15</a>) and endowed with full power to teach, to rule, and to sanctify, she regards dogmatic intolerance not alone as her incontestable right, but also as a sacred <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>. If <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> like every other <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is incapable of double dealing, it must be as intolerant as the multiplication table or geometry. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, therefore, demands, in virtue of her Divine commission to teach, the unconditional acceptance of all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which she preaches and proposes for <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, proclaiming to the world with her Divine Founder the stern warning: "He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> and is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, shall be saved: but he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believeth</a> not shall be condemned" (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs16">Mark 16:16</a>). If, by conceding a convenient right of option or a falsely understood freedom of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, she were to leave everyone at liberty to accept or reject her <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, her constitution, and her <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as the existing differences of <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> compel the modern State to do, she would not only fail in her Divine mission, but would end her own life in <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/14326b.htm">suicide</a>. As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">true God</a> can tolerate no strange gods, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> can tolerate no strange Churches beside herself, or, what amounts to the same, she can recognize none as theoretically justified. And it is just in this exclusiveness that lies her unique strength, the stirring power of her propaganda, the unfailing vigour of her progress. A strictly <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> consequence of this incontestable fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> that outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there is no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> (<em>extra Ecclesiam nulla salus</em>). Scarcely any other <a href="../cathen/01755d.htm">article of faith</a> gives such offence to non-Catholics and occasions so many misunderstandings as this, owing to its supposed hardness and uncharitableness. And yet this proposition is necessarily and indissolubly connected with the above-mentioned principle of the exclusive legitimacy of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and with the <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> commandment of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Since <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> Himself did not leave men free to choose whether they would belong to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or not, it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Christian Church</a> includes as an essential element its necessity for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. In her <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must maintain that intolerance which her Divine Founder Himself proclaimed: "And if he will not hear the church, let him be to thee as the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>" (<a href="../bible/mat018.htm#vrs17">Matthew 18:17</a>). This explains the intense aversion which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has displayed to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, the diametrical opposite to <a href="../cathen/13001a.htm">revealed</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> (cf. <a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#vrs19">1 Timothy 1:19</a>; <a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#vrs25">2 Timothy 2:25</a>; <a href="../bible/tit003.htm#vrs10">Titus 3:10 sq.</a>; <a href="../bible/2th002.htm#vrs11">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>). The celebrated church historian <a href="../cathen/05094a.htm">D&ouml;llinger</a> writes very pertinently: "The Apostles <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no tolerance, no leniency towards <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> Paul inflicted formal <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> on Hymen&aelig;us and Alexander. And such an expulsion from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was always to be inflicted. The Apostles considered <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a> destructive as a wicked example. With weighty emphasis Paul declares (<a href="../bible/gal001.htm#vrs8">Galatians 1:8</a>): 'But though we or an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>'. Even the gentle John forbids the community to offer hospitality to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> coming to it, or even to salute them" ("Christentum und Kirche", Ratisbon, 1860, pp. 236 sq.).

<p>During the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> guarded the purity and genuineness of her Apostolic <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> through the institution of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> (and state) <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, which, with many excellent qualities, had unfortunately also its drawbacks. As justly remarked by <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Cardinal Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a> suffered internally from "serious and lamentable defects", for example, secrecy as to accusers and witnesses, the admission of suspected witnesses, excessive scope for the subjective judgment of the judge, secrecy of the procedure (see <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">INQUISITION</a>). Thus are explained the frightful scenes which <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> witnessed under the grim grand inquisitor, <a href="../cathen/04259b.htm">Conrad of Marburg</a> (d. 1233). Following the example of the Apostles, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> today watches <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> over the purity and integrity of her <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, since on this rests her whole system of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, the whole edifice of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> thought, ideals, and life. For this purpose the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> instituted the Index of Prohibited Books, which is intended to deter <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> from the unauthorized reading of books dangerous to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, for it is <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> that clever sophistry coated with seductive language may render even gross <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> palatable to a guileless and innocent heart. The State itself is at times <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to confiscate books that are dangerous to its existence or to morality in order to protect unsuspecting readers from contagion and to preserve the structure of the social order. But what is right for the State must be also just for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The sharp attack made by <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> on <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">Modernism</a>, which is undermining the foundations not alone of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, but even of natural religion, is simply an act of <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> self-defence against an assault, not only upon individual <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, but likewise upon the whole basis of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Again the ancient expression "heretical poison" (<em>venemum seu virus h&aelig;reticum; pravitas h&aelig;reticalis</em>), which has passed from canon law into the set phraseology of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> chancery and quite naturally sounds hard to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, is to be explained psychologically in view of the above-mentioned fundamental conviction. It is not intended to express any offensive slur on the heterodox, who adhere to their opinions in <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> and in honest conviction. Consequently, the writers who represented <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> as applying to the present generation of honest <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> the historical condemnation which he passed on the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> of the sixteenth century in his <a href="../library/docs_pi10ed.htm">Borrom&aelig;us Encyclical</a>, and thus ascribed to him a public rebuke which he never in the least intended, were guilty of exaggeration and evident <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. Besides, <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> historians have passed much harder judgments on the leaders of the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a>. No <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> takes umbrage at the fact established in every manual of <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, that, after long convulsions and spasms, the <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran Church</a>, by the Formula of Concord (1577), expelled the "crypto-Calvinist poison" which <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Philip Melanchthon</a> had instilled into the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Orthodox <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a>. And did not Crypto-Calvinism really act like blood-poisoning? The canonical expression "<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> poison" is intended to convey no other meaning than that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> dreads as blood-poisoning <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> infection of any kind, whatever be its source.

<p>But does the proposition that outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> there is no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> involve the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> so often attributed to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in virtue of this principle, "condemns and must condemn all non-Catholics"? This is by no means the case. The foolish and unchristian maxim that those who are outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must for that very reason be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> lost is no legitimate conclusion from <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a>. The infliction of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a> pertains not to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who alone can scrutinize the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. The task of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is confined exclusively to the formulating of the principle, which expresses a condition of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> imposed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, and does not extend to the examination of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, who may or may not satisfy this condition. Care for one's own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is the personal concern of the individual. And in this matter the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> shows the greatest possible consideration for the <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> and the innocence of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erring</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a>. Not that she refers, as is often stated, the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the heterodox solely and exclusively to "invincible ignorance", and thus makes sanctifying <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> a convenient gate to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> for the stupid. She places the efficient cause of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all men objectively in the merits of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Redeemer</a>, and subjectively in justification through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> or through <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a> enlivened by the perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both of which may be found outside the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Whoever indeed has recognized the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but contrary to his better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> refuses to enter it and whoever becomes perplexed as to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of his <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, but fails to investigate his <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> seriously, no longer lives in <a href="../cathen/06642a.htm">good faith</a>, but exposes himself to the danger of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal damnation</a>, since he rashly contravenes an important command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Otherwise the gentle breathing of grace is not confined within the walls of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but reaches the hearts of many who stand afar, working in them the marvel of justification and thus ensuring the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of numberless men who either, like upright <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church, or, like so many <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in gross prejudice, cannot appreciate her <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature. To all such, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not close the gate of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, although she insists that there are essential means of grace which are not within the reach of non-Catholics. In his allocution "Singulari quadam" of 9 December, 1854, which emphasized the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogma</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> uttered the consoling principle: "Sed tamen pro certo pariter habendum est, qui ver&aelig; religionis ignorantia laborent, si ea est invincibilis, nulla ipsos obstringi hujusce rei culpa ante oculos Domini" (But it is likewise certain that those who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, if their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is invincible, are not, in this matter, guilty of any fault in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>). (<a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger-Bannwart</a>, 11th ed., Freiburg, 1911, n. 1647.)

<p>As early as 1713 <a href="../cathen/04029a.htm">Clement XI</a> condemned in his dogmatic <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> <a href="../cathen/15128a.htm">"Unigenitus"</a> the proposition of the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenist</a> <a href="../cathen/12601c.htm">Quesnel</a>: "Extra ecclesiam nulla conceditur gratia", i.e. no grace is given outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (op. cit., n. 1379), just as <a href="../cathen/01295a.htm">Alexander VIII</a> had already condemned in 1690 the <a href="../cathen/08285a.htm">Jansenistic</a> proposition of Arnauld: "Pagani, Jud&aelig;i, h&aelig;retici aliique hujus generis nullum omnino accipiunt a Jesu Christo influxum" (Pagans, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and other people of the sort receive no influx [of grace] whatsoever from <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>) (op. cit., n. 1295). In her tolerance toward the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erring</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> indeed goes farther than the large <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">catechism</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Martin Luther</a>, which on "pagans or <a href="../cathen/15097a.htm">Turks</a> or <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>" passes the general and stern sentence of condemnation: "wherefore they remain under eternal wrath and in everlasting damnation." <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who are conversant with the teachings of their Church <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to draw the proper conclusions. Absolutely unflinching in their fidelity to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as the sole means of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> on earth, they will treat with respect, as ethically due, the religious convictions of others, and will see in non-Catholics, not enemies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but brethren. Recognizing from the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Catholic doctrine</a> of grace that the possibility of justification and of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is not withheld even from the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> they will show towards all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, e.g. the various <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> bodies, kindly consideration.

<h2 id="section3">The obligation to show practical civic toleration</h2>

<p>For the practical attitude of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> towards the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heterodox</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has inculcated the strict command of neighbourly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, which corresponds to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity: "Thou shalt <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> thy neighbour as thyself." The sincerest <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">erring</a> is indeed quite compatible with keen repugnance for the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to which they cling. From the very definition of practical civic tolerance (see above, I, 2) springs the maxim which <a href="../cathen/02084a.htm">St. Augustine</a> expresses as follows: "Diligite homines, interficite errores; sine superbia de veritate pr&aelig;sumite, sine s&aelig;vitia pro veritate certate" (Love men, slay <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; without <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> be bold in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, without cruelty fight for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>) (<a href="../fathers/1409.htm"><em>Against Petilian</em> 1.29</a>). <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and consequently His children cannot be sons of hate. The gospel of the Divine paternity in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a> is also the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joyous</a> tidings of the brotherhood of all men on earth. For all without exception the Saviour <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in His capacity of <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high-priest</a> during the night before His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a>, and for all He shed His Blood on the Cross. The sublime example of Christ affords a striking indication of the manner in which we should regulate our conduct towards those who differ from us in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, so to speak, a drop of the redeeming Blood of Christ glistens on every human <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. To penetrate into the inner shrine of another's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> with feelings of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> and distrust is forbidden to all in accordance with the principle: "Nemo pr&aelig;sumitur malus, nisi probetur" (No one is presumed to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> until proved to be so). And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> declares: "Charity is patient, is kind: charity envieth not, dealeth not perversely . . ., is not provoked to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, thinketh no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>" (<a href="../bible/1co013.htm#vrs4">1 Corinthians 13:4 sq.</a>). By this <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> alone is the truly tolerant man, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> disciple of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, recognized. But did not the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> Church by her bloody <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> trample under foot this commandment of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and thus nullify in practice what in theory indeed she always inculcated with honeyed words? The enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> search eagerly the musty documents which tell of inquisitional courts, <em>autos-da-f&eacute;</em>, chambers of horror, instruments of torture, and blazing pyres. Without any palliation of the historical facts, let us examine a little more closely this reproach, and see what importance is to be attached to it.

<p>(1) When the inglorious origin of his forbears is constantly cast in the teeth of an honest nobleman, with the spiteful <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of wounding his feelings, no upright <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> will regard such conduct as tactful or just. What has the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of today to do with the fact that long-vanished generations inflicted, in the name of religion, cruelties with which the modern <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> is disgusted? The children's children cannot be held accountable for the misdeeds of their forefathers. <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> also must take refuge in this principle of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. However much they endeavour to blink the fact, they have also to regret similar occurrences during the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> epoch, when, as everyone knows, the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformers</a> and their successors made free use of the existing penal ordinances and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">punished with death</a> many inconvenient and, according to their view, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> (e.g. the anti-Trinitarians Servetus and Sylvanus, the Osiandrist Funk, the <a href="../cathen/03198a.htm">Calvinist</a> Nicholas Krell at <a href="../cathen/05156b.htm">Dresden</a>). Hundreds of faithful <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who fell victims to the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, are <a href="../cathen/05188b.htm">venerated</a> today as the <a href="../cathen/05474a.htm">English martyrs</a>. The greater number of executions occurred, not under Mary the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, but under Queen Elizabeth. It is, however, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> to hold modern <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a>, in the one instance, and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in the other responsible for these atrocities.

<p>(2) In every age the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has drawn a fundamental distinction (which, on account of its importance, should never be overlooked) between formal and merely material <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and her penal legislation was directed solely against the former category. As the open and obstinate rebellion of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> against the Divinely instituted teaching authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, formal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> still remains one of the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Material <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> on the other hand, i.e. an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> entertained undesignedly and unconsciously, is in itself neither <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinful</a> nor punishable, except where the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is itself inexcusable. In excusable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> are all who possess subjectively the firm and honest conviction that they have the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, thus including the vast majority of non-Catholics, who were born and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> in their particular form of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. Even in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, while using her punitive power only against formal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> had belonged to her body from birth, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> openly proclaimed her incompetency to take action in the case of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, since over these she possessed no <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has been always averse to forcible conversions, as was emphasized in modern times by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Immortale Dei" of 1 November, 1885: "Atque illud quoque magnopere cavere Ecclesia solet, ut ad amplexandam fidem catholicam nemo invitus cogatur, quia quod sapienter Augustinus monet: 'Credere non potest (homo) nisi volens'" (The Church has always taken great care that no one should be compelled against his will to embrace the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, because, as Augustine wisely declares: except he be willing, man cannot believe) (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, op. cit., n. 1875). Hence the tolerance always displayed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, especially towards the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and also the prohibition in canon law to make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> nations merely on account of their unbelief, except when they <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> missionaries or attacked <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> States, as the <a href="../cathen/10424a.htm">Saracens</a> formerly did (cf. <a href="../cathen/01326b.htm">Schmalzgr&uuml;ber</a>, "Jus can. de Jud&aelig;is", n. 53). A decision of <a href="../cathen/06780a.htm">Gregory the Great</a> given in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of Gratian (c. 4 jam vero C. 23, qu. 6) contains no warrant for religious coercion, since the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> simply grants to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> colonists on his domains certain favours which he withholds from settlers obstinately adhering to their <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a>.

<p>(3) If in <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> adopted sterner measures against formal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a>, and schismatics than she adopts today, she did this not as a private individual, who must show only consideration and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but as the legitimate governing authority within whose sphere also fell the administration of penal <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. The State must also inflict on the thief and revolutionary the legal punishment for theft and revolution, which are not punishable in the abstract. However repulsive, when judged from the more refined standpoint of modern civilization, the barbarous cruelty of <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> penal ordinances may be, as expressed even in the "Cautio criminalis" of the German Emperor, <a href="../cathen/03625a.htm">Charles V</a>, against traitors, highway robbers, and <a href="../cathen/11126b.htm">notorious</a> debauchers (impaling, breaking on the wheel), we may not for this reason condemn the whole penal system of that age as judicial <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>; for the legal punishments, while indeed inhuman, were not <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. Now, formal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was likewise strongly condemned by the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Catholic Middle Ages</a>: and so the argument ran: Apostasy and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> are, as criminal rebellions against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, far more serious crimes than high treason, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. But, according to Rom., xiii, 11 sqq., the <a href="../cathen/02137c.htm">secular authorities</a> have the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">right</a> to punish, especially grave crimes, with death; consequently, "heretics may be not only <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, but also justly (<em>juste</em>) <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>" (<a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a>, II-II, Q. xi, a. 3). But there is no need to go back to the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, since the present age likewise furnishes us with examples of extreme severity in the chastisement of certain crimes. With whatever disapproval the philanthropist may view the terrible punishments inflicted on those guilty of rape in parts of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>, adjudging such penalties as excessive in their severity, the jurist will on the other hand seek their explanation in the special circumstances of time and place. American lynch law will not be unreservedly excused or justified, but, in judging it, allowance will be made for the imperfections of the existing penal procedure. The frequent inefficacy of the ordinary procedure is only too likely to excite the enraged populace to deeds of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Keeping these occurrences of modern times before our eyes, we will pass a much juster verdict on the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have, of course, no desire for the return of an age whose liberal, and in many respects admirable, state institutions were greatly marred by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">sinister</a> penal ordinances.

<p>(4) A distinction must be drawn between the penal system as such and its external forms. The barbarous penal forms of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> are to be credited, not to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but to the State. After the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianized</a> Roman Empire had developed into a theocratic (religious) State, it was compelled to stamp crimes against <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> (apostasy, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>) as offences against the State (cf. Cod. Justin., I, 5, de h&aelig;r.: "Quod in religionem divinam committitur, in omnium fertur injuriam"). <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and citizen of the State became identical terms. Consequently, crimes against <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were high treason, and as such were punishable with death. This was the universal opinion in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>. This <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the execution of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> had not the slightest connexion with the essence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or her constitution, and to the primitive Church such a penalty was unknown. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">St. Cyprian</a> (d. 258) disapproved of all external means of coercion, such as were customary in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and claimed for the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> as "spiritual weapon" (<em>spiritualis gladius</em>) <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>, which was worse than death. The earliest example of the execution of a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> was the beheading of the ringleader of the Priscillianists by the usurper Maximus at <a href="../cathen/15042a.htm">Trier</a> (385); this called forth a protest from <a href="../cathen/09732b.htm">St. Martin of Tours</a>, <a href="../cathen/01383c.htm">St. Ambrose</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">Pope Siricius</a> (cf. Histor. polit. Bl&auml;tter, XC, 1890, pp. 330 sqq.). Even St. Augustine, who towards the end of his life favoured state reprisals against the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, always opposed the execution of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> (cf. Ep. c [<em>alias</em> cxxvii]: "Corrigi eos cupimus, non necari"). During the long dominion of the Merovingians and Carlovingians, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was never regarded as a civil crime, and was chastised with no civil penalty. A change came only in the eleventh century when <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ism</a>, which had earlier experienced bloody <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> at the hands of the Eastern emperors <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Theodosius</a> (d. 395) and Justinian (d. 565), revived in the orgies of the Catharists and <a href="../cathen/01267e.htm">Albigenses</a>. These disruptive <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> attacked marriage, the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, wherefore even Lea has to admit: "Had Catharism become predominant, its influence would <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm">infallibly</a> have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> fatal" (History of the <a href="../cathen/08026a.htm">Inquisition</a>, I, 117). Influenced by the Roman code, which was rescued from oblivion, the Hohenstaufen emperor, <a href="../cathen/06255a.htm">Frederick II</a>, who was anything but a warm supporter of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, introduced the penalty of burning for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> by imperial law of 1224 (cf. Monum. Germ., IV Leg., II, 326 sqq.). The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, especially <a href="../cathen/06796a.htm">Gregory IX</a> (d. 1241), favoured the execution of this imperial law, in which they saw an effective means not alone for the protection of the State, but also for the preservation of the Faith. And indeed the danger to the common weal seen in Catharisin inclined neither the State nor the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to mildness, just as in the time of St. Augustine the ill-famed Circumcilliones of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> bore every sign of a public rebellion. Would not even a modern state have to proceed against these murderers and incendiaries with weapon in hand? Unfortunately, neither the secular nor the <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">ecclesiastical authorities</a> drew the slightest distinction between dangerous and harmless <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, seeing forthwith in every (formal) <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> a "contumelia Creatoris", which the theocratic State was called upon to avenge with the pyre. This inability to distinguish may be easily traced even in the writings of <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Luther</a>, <a href="../cathen/03195b.htm">Calvin</a>, <a href="../cathen/10151a.htm">Melanchthon</a>, <a href="../cathen/03025d.htm">Butzer</a>, Wenceslaus, Sturm, Strigel, Matthias Coler, and other <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> leaders. We may, therefore, rightly conclude that the harsh forms of punishment are to be referred partly to the fact that the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were a menace to the community, and partly to the excessive strictness of the ancient penal code.

<p>(5) It follows from what has been said that the custom of burning <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> is really not a question of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but a question of civilization. History shows that even in an age otherwise highly civilized certain especially detestable criminals are severely dealt with. A regrettable illustration is found in the introduction of torture into the trial of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> by <a href="../cathen/08017a.htm">Innocent IV</a> in 1252. Here again the influence of the ancient Roman code is discernible, since it also was accustomed from the earliest times to employ torture not as a punishment, but simply as a regular means of extracting the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from the accused. That, despite its promised "evangelical liberty", the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> introduced no softening of manners, the continuation of torture and the prevalence of witch-burnings even in the eighteenth century clearly show. Torture was first abolished in <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a> (1745) by Frederick the Great; the last <a href="../cathen/15674a.htm">witch</a> was burned in <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a> in 1783. We cannot read without a shudder how in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> high treason, which term included the profession of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>., was punished with hanging and the tearing out of the still throbbing heart from the living body. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> against mendicancy passed in 1572 under Queen Elizabeth ordained that the harmless offence of begging was to be punished with severe scourging, with perforation of the right ear with red hot iron, and, if the offence were repeated, with death (cf. G. Kassel, "Geschichtliche Entwickelung des Deliktes der Bettelei", <a href="../cathen/02761a.htm">Breslau</a>, 1898, p. 37). In <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> no less cruelty was shown. When Henry IV was assassinated by Ravaillac on 14 May, 1610, the unfortunate criminal was mercilessly tortured; he was pierced with red-hot pincers, molten lead was poured over the hand which committed the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, and finally he was torn to pieces by four horses. Exactly the same punishment, even to the smallest details, was meted out to the half-witted Damiens, although he merely scratched the libertine Louis XV with a pen-knife (cf. Pilatus, "Der Jesuitismus", Ratisbon, 1905, pp. 183 sqq.). After the horrors of the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">French Revolution</a> the methods of punishment were gradually softened, and during the course of the nineteenth century humanitarian views won the victory everywhere. It rests with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> to decide whether the penal systems of the future are to be disgraced by cruelty and barbarism or not. The coming generations must see that the return of inhuman penal ordinances shall be made impossible by the refinement of <a href="../cathen/10559a.htm">morals</a>, the deepening of <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> culture, the philanthropic training of the young, and the impression of the mild and gentle characteristics of Christ on civil, national, and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>. Since the secularized State renounced its union with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and excluded <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> from the category of penal offences, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has returned to her original standpoint, and contents herself again with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> and other spiritual penalties (irregularity, ineligibility for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> <a href="../cathen/12371a.htm">prebends</a>, etc.), with which the modern State no longer associates (as in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>) any penal or civil actions.
<h2 id="section4">The necessity for public political toleration</h2>

<p>Since the State may not pose either as the mouthpiece of Divine Revelation or as the teacher of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, it is clear that in regard to matters of religion it can adopt a much more broad-minded position than the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whose attitude is strictly confined by her teaching. The <a href="../cathen/05556a.htm">ethical</a> permissibility, or rather the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a>, of political tolerance and freedom of religion is determined by historical presuppositions and concrete relations; these impose an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> which neither State nor Church can disregard. We will first consider the State in itself, and then the specifically <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> State.

<p>(1) The State is under <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to make external conditions subserve the public good, and to protect against arbitrariness or molestation all <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> and corporations within its territory in the enjoyment of their personal, civic, political, and religious <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a>. This is in an especial manner the function of the constitutional State, which has slowly developed since the end of the eighteenth century. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has always combated the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> that the winning of new members and the recovery of the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> pertain to the State. Christ entrusted, not the State, but the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with the announcement of His Gospel to the whole world. Not even the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> "religious State", whose constitution we shall describe in greater detail below, undertook to act as bearer of a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> revelation or as preacher and judge of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>. The intimate connexion of both powers during the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was only a passing and temporary phenomenon, arising neither from the essential nature of the State nor from that of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is free to enter into a more or less close association with the State, but she can also endure actual separation from the State, and, given favourable circumstances, may even prosper under such conditions, as for example in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of North America</a>. For the State also certain conditions may prevail which render a close union with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> inadvisable or indeed quite impossible. When, for example, several <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> have firmly established themselves and taken root in the same territory, nothing else remains for the State than either to exercise tolerance towards them all, or, as conditions exist today, to make complete religious liberty for <a href="../cathen/07762a.htm">individuals</a> and religious bodies a principle of government.

<p>The final conversion of the old religious State into the modern constitutional State, the lamentable defection of the majority of states from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">Faith</a>, the irrevocable secularization of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of the state, and the coexistence of the most varied religious <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">beliefs</a> in every land have imposed the principle of state tolerance and freedom of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> upon rulers and parliaments as a dire necessity and as the starting-point of political wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. The mixture of races and peoples, the immigration into all lands, the adoption of <a href="../cathen/09073a.htm">international laws</a> concerning colonization and choice of abode, the <a href="../cathen/12213b.htm">economic</a> necessity of calling upon the workers of other lands, etc., have so largely changed the religious map of the world during the last fifty years that propositions 77-79 of the Syllabus published by <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> in 1864 (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, op. cit., 1777-79), from which enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are so fond of deducing her opposition to the granting of equal political <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> to non-Catholics, do not now apply even to <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> or the South American republics to say nothing of countries which even then possessed a greatly mixed population (e.g. <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>). Since the requisite conditions for the erection of new theocratic states, whether <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, are lacking today and will probably not be realized in the future, it is evident on the basis of hard facts that religious liberty is the only possible, and thus the only reasonable, state principle. If, in those lands where she still enjoys a privileged position as state Church (e.g. <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>), the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> would not allow herself to be driven from this position without a protest, she has not only a right, but is even under <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to offer this protest. For a justly acquired right should not be surrendered in silence. In this matter also the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does only what is done by <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> princes, who steadfastly adhere to <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestantism</a> as the state religion (e.g. the King of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>). But the priceless asset of religious peace compels the modern State to concede tolerance and religious freedom. Without this peace, the undisturbed continuation of the commonwealth is inconceivable. The history of the world could not easily display before the eyes of a patriot a more revolting picture than the fratricidal struggles which resulted from the <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> in the religious <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a>. Wherever separate religious parties live in the same land, they must work together in harmony for the public weal. But this would be impossible, if the State, instead of remaining above party, were to prefer or oppress one denomination as compared with the others. Consequently, freedom of religion and <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is an indispensable necessity for the State.

<p>From the standpoint of <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> public law, however, this political tolerance is subject to a threefold limitation, since neither the completely unreligious character of the State nor the unbridled liberty of all imaginable cults may be set up as a principle of government, nor finally may the separation of State and Church be lauded to the skies as the perfect state ideal. These three limitations can be easily justified.

<p>(a) To propose for the State such downright irreligion as a drastic remedy against intolerance is to advise it to saw through the bough on which it sits. For the "State without God", pledged to the "Principles of 1789", would be an immoral monster, which through lack of internal vitality would as surely encounter decay and destruction as did the <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheistic</a> <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolutionary State of France</a> at the opening of the nineteenth century. If it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that human <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> as a whole is bound to recognize the supreme dominion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then no State can shirk the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> of confessing this <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of publicly venerating Him. The religionless State would be nothing less than an <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheistic</a> State, bearing in its very nature the germ of disintegration; since <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a> is in itself and its effects a direct peril to the State. The <a href="../cathen/11447b.htm">pantheistic</a> is not a whit better; for <a href="../cathen/07192a.htm">Hegel's</a> motto, "the State is God", is pure nonsense, since it makes the absurd claim that the State is the original source of all right, and sets the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> State in the place of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> (cf. Syllab. Pii IX, prop. 39). A commonwealth that is to endure can be erected only on a theistic basis, since the fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, fidelity, and obedience, indispensable for the preservation of the State, can exercise their full influence only in theism. Furthermore the respect for <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>, the observance of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of chastity, aversion to revolution and high treason are best secured by a lively <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Consequently, not alone <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> statesmen like Montesquieu and Guizot, but also <a href="../cathen/06258b.htm">freethinkers</a> like Macchiavelli and Voltaire, strongly defended the religious foundations of the State. Even the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagan</a> Cicero (De nat. deor., I) frankly recognized the impossibility of a State without the fear of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, on which depend in turn fidelity and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. A State which is not itself permeated with sentiments of religion and idly tolerates the sapping of religion and morality is preparing the way for revolution, that is for its own destruction. The state axiom of religious freedom can therefore mean only freedom for religion, not freedom from religion or irreligion. In his <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Vehementer nos", of 11 February, 1906, <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pope Pius X</a> sharply denounces for its <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> the violent breach of the Concordat by the French Government, instancing as the chief grievance that, by the official recognition of its own irreligion, the French Republic had forsworn <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, n. 1995). The historian von Treitschke expressed the conviction that "atheists have strictly speaking no place in the state" ("Politik", I, Leipzig., 1897, p. 326); the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> John Locke would hear nothing of state tolerance towards <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheists</a>. With a strange perversity of judgment he would indeed extend this intolerance to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> also, the firmest believers in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> among all classes of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> and the surest supporters of throne and altar. But, as things are today, nothing remains for the State but to tolerate <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheists</a> in its midst so long as they do not, by unlawful deeds, render themselves liable to punishment. In its own interest, however, the State must endeavour to protect and promote <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> among the people by the establishment of good <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, by the training of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believing</a> teachers and officials in <a href="../cathen/13694a.htm">seminaries</a>, lyceums, secondary <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15188a.htm">universities</a>, and finally by leaving the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> free to exert her salutary influence.

<p>(b) A well-ordered commonwealth can no more recognize the maxim of unlimited and unbridled religious freedom than it can adopt the suicidal principle of irreligion. For state toleration of all forms of religion without exception, which could be justified only on the basis of disruptive <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a> or a deistic indifferentism, is in palpable contradiction to <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a> and to every rational system of polity (cf. <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> of <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> "Quanta cura" of 8 December, 1864). If the State as such is under the same <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to confess and venerate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as the individual, it must set bounds to religious freedom at least at the point where the unrestricted exercise of this freedom would lead to the subversion of state security and public morality. The history of religion shows that, to deceive unwary authorities, intrigues most immoral and most dangerous to the State have disguised themselves in the mantle of religion: the cults of <a href="../cathen/10443b.htm">Moloch</a> and Astarte, religious prostitution and community of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, ritual child-murder and <a href="../cathen/01445b.htm">Anabaptist</a> horrors, conventicles for debauchery and anarchistic <a href="../cathen/14071b.htm">secret societies</a>, etc. No State with a regard for its own preservation will hesitate to raise a barrier against moral, religious, and political <a href="../cathen/01452a.htm">anarchy</a>; and to repel with vigour all such attacks aimed, under the mask of freedom of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, at the existence of <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a>. Free competition between <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, which is sometimes urged in the name of tolerance, promises neither for the State nor the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> an enduring success; the free competition between virtue and vice could be upheld by the same reasoning. There are certain deceits and vices which display their immorality so plainly that the State must mercilessly apply her penal law and, in the interest of the community, prevent their propagation. Thus <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, in general so indulgent towards <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">paganism</a> in her colonies, could not tolerate the continuation among the <a href="../cathen/07358b.htm">Hindus</a> of the ritual <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of children and the burning of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> (the <em>Suttee</em>), prohibiting the former under severe penalties in 1802 and the latter in 1829 (cf. Lecky, "Democracy and Liberty", I, 1896, pp. 424 sqq.). Again, although the Constitution of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> guarantees complete freedom of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, the American people always found <a href="../cathen/10570c.htm">Mormonism</a> unbearable., and never rested until, by forbidding <a href="../cathen/02564a.htm">polygamy</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10570c.htm">Mormons</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> conception of marriage had been recognized. Not even the <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheistic</a> <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolutionary State of France</a> granted an unlimited freedom of religious opinions in its "D&eacute;claration des droits de l'homme" (1791), since it added the clause: "pourvu que leur manifestation ne trouble pas l'ordre public &eacute;tabli par la loi". Almost all modern States have admitted this limitation of religious freedom into their constitutions.

<p>(c) <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> public law erects a third barrier to complete religious freedom in forbidding that the principle of the separation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> be raised to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> ideal of the State and regarded as fundamentally the best form of the State; this does not mean that in certain exceptional cases actual separation may not be more beneficial for both <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> than their organic union. While this separation may be always viewed as relatively the better condition, it does not thereby become the ideal state. The latter is only then attained when <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> proceed hand in hand and in perfect harmony to promote by their common efforts the temporal and eternal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of their common subjects. As it is unnatural for a married couple to live separated, although separation may be defended in particular instances as the better or less harmful arrangement in view of quarrels which have arisen, so also the ideal relation between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> is to be found, not in the separation of the two, but in their harmonious co-operation (cf. <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Quanta cura" of 8 December, 1864; Syllab. prop. 55). As a practical <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the internal advantages of a separation in principle, it is usual to point to the example of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> which has extended the blessing of its liberal Constitution in recent years to its newly-acquired colonies of <a href="../cathen/12291b.htm">Porto Rico</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12010a.htm">Philippine Islands</a>. But, while it may be granted without reserve that both <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> seem to prosper exceedingly well in their friendly juxtaposition, it would be rash to speak of the situation as ideal. It must, however, be acknowledged that no other land in the world has so honourably maintained the amicable separation of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a>, while in some <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">European</a> countries the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of separation was unfortunately only a pretext for a more violent attack on the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Not without good reason did <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> in his <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> of 1902, addressed to the American <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a>, express his approval of a wise and patriotic adaptation to the national and legal conditions of the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a>. He could do this with a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, although in his <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> "Immortale Dei" of 1 November, 1885, he had declared the harmonious union of the two highest powers the ideal situation, and had referred to <a href="../cathen/04196a.htm">concordats</a> as the means of arranging questions bordering on both jurisdictions. If the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States</a> forms the sole honourable exception to the rule, this is due partly to the fact that the State neglects neither the religious factor at large nor <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, as is shown by the strict <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> concerning Sunday observance, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> monogamy, and the celebration of <a href="../cathen/14555a.htm">Thanksgiving Day</a>. What E. Walter wrote fifty years ago is still <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> today: "Even in the <a href="../cathen/15156a.htm">United States of North America</a>, to which people so readily appeal, religion is not regarded as a matter of indifference to the State, but is presupposed as the State's complement" ("Naturrecht und Politik im Lichte der Gegenwart", Bonn, 1863, p. 495).

<p>(2) By a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> State we understand a community which is composed exclusively of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> subjects and which recognizes <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> as the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. In this case also the relations between <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> may be different, according as the two powers are closely united for offence and defence, or, while each maintains its independence, are less compactly joined. The first kind of union finds its truest expression in the "religious state", a distinctive feature of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, while the second or looser union may be realized in a constitutional state that admits various <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> and yet retains its <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> character. In view of the difference of the fundamental <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">ideas</a> on which these two forms of state are based, the principles of political tolerance are subject to important modifications.

<p>(a) Every religious State, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a>, presupposes by its very existence that all or nearly all the citizens have the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, otherwise it would be contrary to natural <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and practically impossible. In certain cases such a State must take drastic measures to expel or exclude all elements which do not fit into its framework. Thus a <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> religious State was forcibly instituted in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> under Queen Elizabeth by clearing the country of all <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and the Diet of Upsala in 1593 strove to preserve the strictly <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheran</a> character of Sweden by making the immigration of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> punishable with death. The situation of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religious State in the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a> was somewhat, though not entirely, similar. The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> required that the State should lend the secular arm to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for the maintenance of all her doctrines, <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and ordinances, and that in return it should receive from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> spiritual support in all purely secular affairs. Thus State and Church formed the two all-embracing members of the one <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> body, assisting and supporting each other in the broad field of all secular and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> interests. Empire and <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papacy</a>, like body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, formed an organic whole. Citizen and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> were interchangeable terms. The rebel against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was regarded as likewise a rebel against the State, and conversely the political revolutionary was by that very fact an enemy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Whoever was stricken with <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> finally incurred also imperial ban, and the imperial ban brought <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> in its train. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that many advantages must be conceded to the religious State. We see an imposing and elevating <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> rendered concrete in the supreme dominion of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> spirit throughout the civic, national, and <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious life</a>, in the organic connexion of the secular and the religious government, and in the strengthening of the state authority by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority by the State. These great advantages, however, must not cause us to overlook the numerous drawbacks which this mystical marriage of <a href="../cathen/14250c.htm">Church and State</a> involved. First of all, in consequence of the fusion of the objects of the State and of religion, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religious State was compelled to adopt an attitude of fundamental intolerance towards all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which became so many crimes against the State. Viewed from the historical standpoint one may justly <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether the bloody persecutions resulted in greater <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessings</a> and advantages or in greater want, hate, and suffering for <a href="../cathen/03699b.htm">Christendom</a> (cf. De Laveley, "Le gouvernement dans la d&eacute;mocratie", I, Paris, 1892, pp. 157-62). It is <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certain</a> that the odium for all those severities and cruelties had to be borne, not by the State which inflicted them, but rather by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, since she seemed to stand behind all these measures as the secret motive force, even though she did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, much less justify many of them. We endeavoured above without partiality to appraise these accusations against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> value. To refer briefly to another gloomy aspect of this question, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> right to meddle directly in purely secular affairs might easily become a dangerous prerogative, inasmuch as the infliction of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a> for purely political offences must necessarily have brought <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> penalties, especially when they were <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> inflicted, into great discredit among princes and people. On the other hand, the right of protection exercised by the sovereign in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, often without or even against the wish of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a>, had for its unavoidable consequence the loss of public respect for both authorities. The proverbial contest between <em>imperium</em> and <em>sacerdotium</em>, which practically runs through the whole history of the <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">Middle Ages</a>, redounded in fact to the advantage of neither. A third disadvantage, arising essentially from the religious State, may not be passed over in silence; this consists in the danger that the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, trusting blindly to the interference of the secular arm in their behalf, may easily sink into dull resignation and spiritual torpor, while the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, owing to the religious surveillance of the State, may develop rather into a race of <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocrites</a> and pietists than into inwardly convinced <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. A <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> which relies on State assistance for its pastoral activity lacks that glowing <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which springs from heartfelt convictions, and the vitality and sincerity of religion are grievously impaired when practices of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> are made compulsory by the State. The last and most serious disadvantage associated with the religious State lies in the immanent danger that the claim of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to supremacy over the State must almost necessarily call forth the opposite extreme of C&aelig;saropapism. The early protectorate of the State thus develops finally into the complete control and enslavement of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Such in fact has been the historical sequence. Not alone in the Eastern Empire, in which Byzantine C&aelig;saropapism won its greatest triumphs, but also in the Western Empire these unworthy tendencies were all too clearly revealed, especially under the Hohenstaufens.

<p>(b) When various <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> establish themselves in any country, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> State can no longer maintain its former exclusive attitude, but is compelled for reasons of State to show tolerance towards the heterodox and to grant them religious freedom within the limits described above and determined by <a href="../cathen/09076a.htm">natural law</a>. If religious freedom has been accepted and sworn to as a fundamental law in a constitution, the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> to show this tolerance is binding on <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> recognizes unreservedly the inviolability of constitutions confirmed by <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, of traditional <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and regular religious compacts, because a breach of the constitution, of allegiance, of a treaty, or of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is a grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and because the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> moral law prescribes fidelity to the State as an <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligation</a> strictly binding in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. To justify ethically tolerance towards certain religious practices of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> subjects, <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> appealed to the principle that tolerance might be always exercised wherever either its refusal would cause more harm than good, or, vice versa, whenever the granting of it ensured greater advantage than disadvantage. Thus <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> teaches (<a href="../summa/3010.htm#article11">Summa theologica II-II:10:11</a>): "Ritus infidelium tolerari possunt vel propter aliquod bonum, quod ex eis provenit, vel propter aliquod maum, quod vitatur" (Heathen worships can be tolerated either because of some good that results from them or because of some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that is avoided). In all the centuries the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> displayed an admirable tolerance especially towards the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jewish religion</a>, since the survival of <a href="../cathen/08537a.htm">Judaism</a> offered a living <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>. The <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval</a> principle of tolerance is specially applicable to present conditions, since the historical development of the modern State has created throughout the world so uniform a basis of <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> that even <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> States cannot without violation of <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oaths</a> and loyalty and without violent internal convulsions disregard it, even if they desired to do so. Besides, there is good reason to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> if there still exists a purely <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> State in the world; and it is, of course, just as <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> whether there is such a thing as a purely <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestant</a> State. Cosmopolites have established colonies and settlements everywhere, and to these <a href="../cathen/09073a.htm">international law</a> concedes freedom of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> and worship. Consequently, <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> also supported the principle of tolerance, when he declared (cf. <a href="../cathen/04736b.htm">Denzinger</a>, n. 1874): "Revera si divini cultus varia genera eodem jure esse quo veram religionem Ecclesia judicat non licere, non ideo tamen damnat rerum publicarum moderatores, qui magni alicujus adipiscendi boni aut prohibendi causa mali moribus atque usu patienter ferunt, ut ea habeant singula in civitate locum" (If the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> declares that the various kinds of worship should not have the same <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, she does not thereby condemn those rulers who, in order to secure some great good or to avert some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, permit each cult to exist).

<p>There are, however, a number of States, which in virtue of their constitutions are committed not alone to tolerance and religious freedom, but also to parity. By parity is understood the placing of all legalized or recognized religious bodies on the same footing before the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a>, all show of partiality and disfavour being equally avoided. Such is the basic principle of the constitutional State, which, while ethically <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, allows various forms of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>. On it devolves especially the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> of placing no obstacle in the way of the public promotion of religion in sermon and writing and of extending to the religious practices of all <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> the same legal protection, to the exclusion of any compulsory system that would bind the citizens to receive certain religious rites (e.g. <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, burial) from <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergymen</a> appointed by the State. With freedom of <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> are intimately associated the personal right of changing one's religion and the right of the parties in the case of <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a> to decide as to the religious <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the children. The State must likewise recognize and protect the right of the various <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> to hold <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and their right of self-government, in so far as these <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> are enjoyed by all legally constituted corporations. Wherever such a State makes contributions or grants from the budget of public ownership, all recognized religious associations must receive equal consideration., unless a particular association, in virtue of a special title (e.g. the secularization of religious <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a>), has legal claims to exceptional treatment. Finally, legal equality must be granted to the adherents of all <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">denominations</a> in both their civic and national capacities, especially in the matter of appointment to public office. Concerning <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> States in which various <a href="../cathen/12738a.htm">religions</a> exist, F. Walter, the well-known professor of public law, made the wise observation: "The government as such, entirely regardless of the personal <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> of the sovereign, must maintain towards every church the same attitude as if it belonged to this Church. In the consistent and upright observance of this standpoint lies the means of being just to each religion and of preserving for the State its <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> character" (loc. cit., p. 491). Such indeed is the admirable theory; wherever deviations from it occur in practice, they are almost without exception to the detriment of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>.
