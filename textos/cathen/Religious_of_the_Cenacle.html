<h1>Religious of the Cenacle</h1>  

<p>The Society of Our Lady of the Cenacle was founded in 1826, at La Louvesc in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, near the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/08464a.htm">St. John Francis Regis</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit</a> apostle of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, by Jean-Pierre-Etienne Terme, a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> missionary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15493a.htm">Diocese of Viviers</a>, and Marie-Victoire-Therese Couderc, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> twenty years of age, but already mature, in <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, energy, and the living resources of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Desirous to attract <a href="../cathen/12085a.htm">pilgrims</a> to the <a href="../cathen/14773b.htm">tomb</a> of <a href="../cathen/08464a.htm">St. John Francis Regis</a>, and induce them to there recollect themselves in solitude, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and meditation, they resolved to open houses where <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> might follow the exercises of a retreat; the first of these houses was opened at La Louvesc. Father Terme was not to see the full development of his work; he died in 1834, leaving his religious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to the direction of the <a href="../cathen/14081a.htm">Jesuit Fathers</a>. Encouraged by episcopal authority, and then by Popes <a href="../cathen/07006a.htm">Gregory XVI</a>, <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, the last of whom definitely approved its constitutions, the new institute grew rapidly and soon counted houses in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a>, <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, <a href="../cathen/02395a.htm">Belgium</a>, <a href="../cathen/14358a.htm">Switzerland</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10759a.htm">Holland</a>. In <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a>, the first house was opened at <a href="../cathen/09584b.htm">Manchester</a>, in 1888. The year 1892 saw the first foundation in America, at New York.

<p>The Society of Our Lady of the Cenacle honours particularly, and proposes to itself for its model, the retirement of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Blessed Virgin</a> in the Cenacle, after the <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension of our Lord</a>, while the whole Church, expecting the Holy Ghost, "were persevering with one mind in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and Mary the mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>" (<a href="../bible/act001.htm#vrs14">Acts 1:14</a>). The <a href="../cathen/12748b.htm">religious</a> of this <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> aim, first, at their own personal sanctification; secondly, at procuring the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and perfection of their neighbour. It is this twofold end that they endeavour to attain by the invisible apostolate of perpetual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the recitation of the <a href="../cathen/11219a.htm">Divine Office</a>, and the daily Exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05584a.htm">Blessed Sacrament</a>, as well as by the exercise of exterior forms of apostolate, principally in providing for spiritual retreats and the teaching of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a>.

<p>The houses of the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> are open at any time to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of all classes wishing to make the Spiritual, that is, apply themselves for a few days to the consideration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to recollection and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, either in order to make a choice for the disposition of their future life, or because they feel it <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessary</a> to regulate their lives in a more <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> manner. From its origin, the <a href="../cathen/14074a.htm">society</a> has taken up the teaching of <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrine</a> as a powerful means of apostolate, and receives all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are desirous to learn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truths</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so as to dispose themselves for the reception of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, also all who are preparing to enter the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or who, after their return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seek to strengthen themselves in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Other means used are the day's retreat, associations, etc.; in fact, all offices of spiritual charity proper to extend the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a> in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, according to the spirit of the Cenacle, are employed by the Society of Our Lady of the Cenacle, for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ and the Blessed Virgin.
