<h1>Ren&eacute;-Just Ha&uuml;y</h1>  

<p>Mineralogist; b. at Saint-Just (Oise), 28 Feb., 1743; d. at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 3 June, 1822. His father was a poor weaver and he owed his early <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12387b.htm">Premonstratensian</a> Abbey of saint-Just, who were struck by his talent and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and his predilection for <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> chant. Their prior sent him to <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he served for a time as chorister and then was admitted to the College of Navarre. After a successful course of study he was made one of the teaching staff. A few years later he was <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and became Professor at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Cardinal Lemoine. Up to this time literature had been his chosen study but a friendship for one of his fellow-professors induced him to take up botany. His interest was, however, more powerfully awakened in mineralogy by some lectures of Daubenton which he happened to hear at the Jardin du Roi. The crystalline structure of minerals appealed to him more than their chemical or geological characteristics. It is said that while examining the crystal collection of Du Croisset, he had the misfortune to drop a fine specimen of calc-spar which broke into pieces. This accident <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the beginning of those exhaustive studies which made him the father of modern crystallography. He examined the fragments and was struck by the forms which they assumed. Many specimens were studied and he found that crystals of the same composition possessed the same internal nucleus, even though their external forms differed. He also established the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">law</a> of symmetry and was able to show that the forms of crystal are perfectly definite and based an fixed <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>.

<p>The merit of his discoveries was early recognized by Daubenton and Laplace. They urged him to make them known to the Academy of Sciences, which admitted him membership. Besides his researches in crystallography, Ha&uuml;y was also one of the pioneers in the development of pyro-electricity. After twenty years' service, he retired from his professorship at the <a href="../cathen/04107b.htm">college</a> of Cardinal Lemoine, to devote himself exclusively to his favourite <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. During the <a href="../cathen/13009a.htm">Revolution</a> he suffered much in common with other <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">ecclesiastics</a> who refused to take the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> demanded of them. His papers were seized, has collection of crystals scattered, and he himself was <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">imprisoned</a> at the Seminaire de Saint-Firmin. Nothing, however, could disturb his equanimity. He continued his studies as before, and it was only with difficulty that his colleague and former pupil, Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, could induce him to accept the release he had procured for him. In 1794 he was appointed curator of the Cabinet des Mines, and in the same year he became professor of physics at the Ecole Normale. After the death of Dolmieu he was appointed to the chair of mineralogy at the Museum of Natural History, in <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, where he lectured with much success and materially increased the collections. After the Restoration he was deprived of his professorship and spent his last days in poverty. His <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">cheerfulness</a>, however, never deserted him. His life was simple and his character lofty, and he ever remained faithful to his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a>. Few teachers have so thoroughly gained the affection of their students and the esteem and homage of their contemporaries. <a href="../cathen/10687a.htm">Napoleon</a> held him in admiration and made him honorary canon of Notre Dame and one of the first members of the Legion of Honour.

<p>Ha&uuml;y was the author of many important works, the chief being "Essai d'une Th&eacute;orie sur la Structure des Cristaux" (Paris, 1784); "Exposition raisonn&eacute;e de la Th&eacute;orie de l'Electricit&eacute; et du Magnetisme" (Paris, 1787) "Trait&eacute; de Min&eacute;ralogie" (Paris, 1801); "Trait&eacute; &eacute;l&eacute;mentairede Physique" (Paris, 1803); "Trait&eacute; de Cristallographie" (Paris, 1817).
