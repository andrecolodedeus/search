<h1>Ren&eacute;-Prosper Tassin</h1>  

<p><a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">French</a> historian, belonging to the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> <a href="../cathen/10069b.htm">Congregation of Saint-Maur</a>, born at Lonlay, in the <a href="../cathen/09143b.htm">Diocese of Le Mans</a>, in 1697; died at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, 1777. He was <a href="../cathen/12451b.htm">professed</a> at the Abbey of Jumi&egrave;ges in 1718. United in close friendship with his brother-religious, Dom Toustain, he collaborated with him on a new edition of the works of Theodore the Studite, which task led them to visit <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> together. Their work was interrupted by a dispute between the <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictine</a> Abbey of <a href="../cathen/11360b.htm">St. Ouen</a> and the chapter of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> which was supported by the erudite Sass. Tassin and his friend wrote against Sass in defence of their brethren. They then resided at the Abbey of <a href="../cathen/13208b.htm">Rouen</a> where they remained till 1747, when they were summoned to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">convent</a> of Saint-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s, at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>, by their general. To defend the authenticity of the deeds of their <a href="../cathen/01010a.htm">abbey</a> they were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to make a deep study of diplomacy, a <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a> dealing with diplomas, charters, and other official documents, which <a href="../cathen/09479b.htm">Mabillon</a> had already set forth in his celebrated Latin work, "De re diplomatica". As a result of their researches they wrote the "Nouveau trait&eacute; de diplomatique", six quarto volumes, which appeared between the years 1750 and 1765. Toustain having died before the second volume was entirely printed, Tassin completed the great work alone, but he wished the name of his friend to be associated with all the volumes; these, consequently, are known like the first two as the work of "two <a href="../cathen/02443a.htm">Benedictines</a>". Later Tassin wrote his "Histoire litt&eacute;raire de la Congr&eacute;gation de Saint-Maur" (Paris and <a href="../cathen/03021a.htm">Brussels</a>, 1770, in quarto), a model history containing the lives and list of works, printed or in Manuscript, of all the learned authors of the Congregation, from its formation (1618) till the time when Tassin wrote, together with a list of their works, printed or in Manuscript. Several Manuscript works of Tassin are in the National Library at <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a>.
