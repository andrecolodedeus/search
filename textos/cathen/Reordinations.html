<h1>Reordinations</h1>  

<h2 id="section1">State of the question</h2>

<p>The Oratorian Jean Morin, in the seventeenth century, and <a href="../cathen/07262a.htm">Cardinal Hergenr&ouml;ther</a>, in the nineteenth, designated as "reordinations" the history of all ordinations which were considered null for any other reason than defect of the prescribed form or intention and which were repeated. This means that if there were in fact reordinations corresponding to this definition they were unjustifiable because <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theology</a> determines as the sole causes of nullity of the <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Sacrament of Holy orders</a> defect of the prescribed form or intention. But in the course of the <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">history of the Church</a> other causes of nullity have been admitted in certain circumstances. It has been admitted that all or any <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> administered or received <em>extra ecclesiam</em> (outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>) were null and had to be repeated. By the words <em>extra ecclesiam</em> is understood the situation of the minister or the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, or <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. At certain periods these separatists were considered so dangerous and were kept at such a distance that there was a tendency to deny them wholly or in part the power of conferring the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. The maxim, "Out of the Church, no sacraments", was applied with more or less severity.
<h2 id="section2">The facts</h2>

<p>That this history is complex and difficult is shown by the action of the <a href="../cathen/15030c.htm">Council of Trent</a>. The council declared as a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> affirming the validity of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> administered outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> according to the prescribed form and <a href="../cathen/08069b.htm">intention</a>; but the validity of <a href="../cathen/04215b.htm">confirmation</a> and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> conferred under the same <a href="../cathen/04211a.htm">conditions</a> was not defined as a matter of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, owing to the waverings and partial disagreements on these points of <a href="../cathen/15006b.htm">tradition</a> revealed by the history of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theology</a>. The council was unwilling to give a definition that would place the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> of numerous writers in opposition to a teaching of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. A good judge in these matters, <a href="../cathen/11702b.htm">Father Perrone</a>, has written:

<blockquote><p>Ordinationes ab illegitimo ministro peractas illicitus esse, nemo umquam theologorum dubitavit: utrum vero pr&aelig;terea irrit&aelig;, inanes ac null&aelig; habend&aelig; sint, implicatissima olim questio fuit, adeo ut Magister Sententiarum scribat: 'Hanc qu&aelig;stionem perplexam ac p&aelig;ne insolubilem faciunt doctorum verba, qu&aelig; plurimum dissentire videntur' (I, iv, dist. 25); deinde profert quatuor sententias, qui nulli adh&aelig;reat. Monumenta ecclesiastica prope innumera pro utraque sententia, sive affirmante irritas esse eiusmodi ordinationes sive negante, stare videntur, cum res nondum eliquata esset. Nunc iam a pluribus s&aelig;culis sola viget S. Thom&aelig; doctrina, cui suffragium accessit univers&aelig; ecclesi&aelig;, ordinationes ab h&aelig;reticis, schismaticis ac simoniacis factas validas omnino esse habendas"</p></blockquote>

<p>That ordinations performed by an unlawful <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">minister</a> are illicit, no theologian ever <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>; but whether they are, moreover, to be regarded as null and void was of old a most intricate question &mdash; so much so that the <a href="../cathen/11768d.htm">Master of the Sentences</a> writes: "This problem is rendered complex and almost insoluble by the statements of the <a href="../cathen/05072b.htm">doctors</a> which show considerable discrepancy" (I, iv, dist. 25). He then presents four opinions, none of which he adopts. For each view &mdash; that which <a href="../cathen/01179a.htm">affirms</a> and that which denies the nullity of such ordinations &mdash; there seemed to be innumerable evidences from <a href="../cathen/07365a.htm">church history</a>, as long as the question was not cleared up. But for several centuries past, the teaching of <a href="../cathen/14663b.htm">St. Thomas</a> alone has prevailed and is accepted by the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to the effect that ordinations performed by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatical</a>, or <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> <a href="../cathen/10326a.htm">ministers</a> are to be considered as valid ["Tractatus de ordine", cap. iv, n. 136, in <a href="../cathen/10290a.htm">Migne</a>, "Theologi&aelig; cursus completus", XXV (Paris, 1841), 55].

<p>In the second half of the fifth century the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople repeated the confirmation and <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> conferred by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, Macedonians, <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatians</a>, Quartodecimans, and <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarists</a> (Beveridge, "Synodicon", II, Oxford, 1672, Annotationes, 100). The Roman Synod of 769 permitted and even prescribed the repetition of orders conferred by the <a href="../cathen/01582a.htm">antipope</a> Constantine ("Liber Pont.", ed. Duchesne, I, 408 sqq.). In the ninth century, during the struggle with the <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopi</a>, the ordinations conferred by those <a href="../cathen/12386b.htm">prelates</a> were often declared null. In 881-82 <a href="../cathen/08423c.htm">Pope John VIII</a> prescribed the reordination of Bishop Joseph of <a href="../cathen/15348b.htm">Vercelli</a>, who had been <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordained</a> by the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/10298a.htm">Milan</a>, then under the ban of <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunication</a>. On several occasions the ordinations conferred by Pope Formosus were declared null and were repeated. After the eleventh century the discussions concerning <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simony</a> gave new sharpness to the controversy about reordinations. Cardinal Humbert affirmed the nullity of <a href="../cathen/14001a.htm">simoniacal</a> ordinations as did also the Synod of Girona (Spain) in 1078. In the strife between the emperors of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> of the eleventh and twelfth centuries the power of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">ordination</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schismatic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> was discussed and denied in various ways (cf. Saltet, "Les r&eacute;ordinations", 205-412). In the thirteenth century the conditions for the validity of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a> were determined in such a way that since then all uncertainty has been excluded.
<h2 id="section3">Interpretations and conclusions</h2>

<p>The chief instances just cited and the attempts that have been made to justify them, constitute, from the <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> standpoint, <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> deformations. It is not then surprising that these difficulties have sometimes and even quite recently, been used as objections against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, especially by <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a>, who are always sensitive on the question of ordinations. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that during these controversies the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> was more than once involved. But to what extent? It is obvious that the decisions of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> on these points did not possess the character required by the Council of the Vatican for definitions involving the sovereign authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a> in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrinal</a> matters. In the history of reordinations the authority of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> is much less concerned than in the <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> regarding the relations of the civil and <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> powers, in which, nevertheless, as <a href="../cathen/14580a.htm">theologians</a> maintain, <a href="../cathen/07790a.htm#IIIB">papal infallibility</a> is not involved (cf. <a href="../cathen/06051a.htm">J. Fessler</a>, "La vraie et la fausse infallibilit&eacute; des papes", Paris, 1873). The question as to the conditions for the validity of certain <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> was one of those that caused serious divisions in the early Church. The <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> cannot be held responsible for these lengthy controversies. In ancient times it was the whole Church that sought the solution of these great difficulties. At a time when <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> organization was only just beginning, the initiative, and the responsibilities as well, were heavy burdens for the great Churches and their heads. It was not only the tradition of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> which at first was somewhat hesitant on certain aspects of this question, but that of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in general, and in this matter the tradition of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was incomparably more firm than that of all the other Churches. To accuse the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in this matter is to accuse the Universal Church; and on this as on so many other questions the <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglican Church</a> has an interest in common with the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman Church</a>. <a href="../cathen/11235a.htm">Old Catholics</a> and <a href="../cathen/01498a.htm">Anglicans</a> often bring charges against the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">Roman See</a>, which, if they had the value that is claimed for them, would tell not only against the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> but also against the early Church and the Fathers. Against this manner of representing the state of <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> tradition concerning the conditions for the validity of <a href="../cathen/11279a.htm">Holy orders</a>, only they can raise objection who interpret in a strict sense the saying of Vincent of L&eacute;rins: "Quod ubique, quod semper, quod ab omnibus". But to defend this thesis is to undertake to show in tradition the absolute identity and the unchangeableness of the most essential <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">Christian doctrines</a>, a task which will readily appear impossible. History shows us in the life of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and in <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> a movement between determined limits and the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> as regulators of this movement. To implicate the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">popes</a> in the long history of these controversies it must be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that they failed in this task, which cannot be done.
