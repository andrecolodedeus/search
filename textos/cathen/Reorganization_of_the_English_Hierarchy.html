<h1>Reorganization of the English Hierarchy</h1>  

<p>On 29 September, 1850, by the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a> "Universalis Ecclesiae", <a href="../cathen/12134b.htm">Pius IX</a> restored the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> in <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> which had become extinct with the death of the last <a href="../cathen/09766a.htm">Marian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the reign of Elizabeth. <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a> became the metropolitan see and its occupant the lawful <a href="../cathen/01641a.htm">successor</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/03299b.htm">Canterbury</a>.

<p>The suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> were Southwark, <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham</a> (changed to Hexham and Newcastle in 1861), Beverley, <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, <a href="../cathen/13399a.htm">Salford</a>, <a href="../cathen/13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a>, Newport and Menevia, <a href="../cathen/04058c.htm">Clifton</a>, <a href="../cathen/12171b.htm">Plymouth</a>, <a href="../cathen/11133a.htm">Nottingham</a>, <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11107b.htm">Northampton</a>. In 1878 Beverley was divided into the two new Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/09112a.htm">Leeds</a> and Middlesborough. And in 1895 <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, except Glamorganshire, was separated into the Dioceses of Newport and Menevia, and of <a href="../cathen/13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a>, and formed into the Vicariate of <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>. The vicariate was erected into the <a href="../cathen/10187d.htm">Diocese of Menevia</a> in 1898. The <a href="../cathen/12296a.htm">Diocese of Portsmouth</a> was formed in 1882, by the division of the <a href="../cathen/14162b.htm">Diocese of Southwark</a> into the Dioceses of <a href="../cathen/14162b.htm">Southwark</a> and <a href="../cathen/12296a.htm">Portsmouth</a>. Thus, the province of Westmister having fifteen suffragan <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> was numerically the largest in the world. By letters Apostolic, "Si qua est", of 28 October, 1911, <a href="../cathen/12137a.htm">Pius X</a> erected the new provinces of <a href="../cathen/02578c.htm">Birmingham</a> and <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>. With Westminster remained the suffragan Sees of <a href="../cathen/11107b.htm">Northampton</a>, <a href="../cathen/11133a.htm">Nottingham</a>, <a href="../cathen/12296a.htm">Portsmouth</a>, and Southwark; to Birmingham were assigned those of <a href="../cathen/04058c.htm">Clifton</a>, Newport, <a href="../cathen/12171b.htm">Plymouth</a>, <a href="../cathen/13759c.htm">Shrewsbury</a>, and Menevia; and to <a href="../cathen/09314a.htm">Liverpool</a>, <a href="../cathen/07318b.htm">Hexham and Newcastle</a>, <a href="../cathen/09112a.htm">Leeds</a>, Middlesborough, and <a href="../cathen/13399a.htm">Salford</a>.

<p>It had for many years been felt that some such division would have to be made, but there had always been the fear of causing disunion thereby, especially if it meant as in pre-Reformation times a division between north and south. Such a result was obviated by ignoring the precedent of York and Canterbury, and arranging for three instead of two provinces; and also by the grant in the <a href="../cathen/01636a.htm">Apostolic Constitution</a> of <blockquote> "certain new distinctions of preeminence, for the preservation of unity in government and policy, to the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a> for the time being, comprised under the following three heads: He will be permanent chairman of the meetings of the Bishops of all <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>, and for this reason it will be for him to summon these meetings and to preside over them, according to the rules in force in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and elsewhere. (2) He will take rank above the other two <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishops</a>, and will throughout all <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a> enjoy the privilege of wearing the <a href="../cathen/11427a.htm">pallium</a>, of occupying the throne, and of having the cross borne before him. (3) Lastly, in all dealings with the Supreme Civil Authority, he will in his <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">person</a> represent the entire Episcopate of <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and <a href="../cathen/15532a.htm">Wales</a>. Always, however, he is to take the opinion of all the Bishops, and to be guided by the votes of the major part of them." </blockquote>

<p>Thus, though the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a> was vested with more powers and privileges than <a href="../cathen/12423b.htm">primates</a> usually enjoy, unity of action has been safeguarded.

<p>The grouping of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> is rather curious. Instead of the natural division into a northern, a midland, and a southern province, formed by drawing a line from the Humber to the Mersey, and another from the Wash to the Bristol Channel, the Westminster or eastern province and the Birmingham or western province reach from the south-east and south-west to the Humber and Mersey respectively. In this way the northern province is contiguous to the other two, bringing all three into closer intercommunication. It is interesting to note that in 787 an attempt was made to have a third province with the <a href="../cathen/10244c.htm">metropolitan</a> at <a href="../cathen/09232a.htm">Lichfield</a>, but in 803 it was abandoned and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of central <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> were again made subject to Canterbury.

<p>The English <a href="../cathen/07322c.htm">hierarchy</a> was reorganized to "promote the greater good of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and the development of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion". And before new <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">sees</a> could be formed it was felt necessary to erect more ecclesiastical provinces out of the already abnormal extensive <a href="../cathen/12514a.htm">province</a> of Westminster. That this was the object in view seems clear from the concluding words of the <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Bull</a>: "We have reserved to ourselves the taking of further measures in this matter of the reconstitution of the English <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, as shall seem opportune, and as experience may suggest and the good of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> require." In accordance with the instructions of the Constitution the present <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/15592c.htm">Westminster</a>, Francis Cardinal Bourne, executed these new ordinances by <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> dated 1 December, 1911, which was ordered to be read at the meetings of the metropolitan and other <a href="../cathen/03438a.htm">cathedral</a> chapters throughout <a href="../cathen/05445a.htm">England</a> and Wales.
