<h1>Reparation</h1>  

<p>Reparation is a <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> concept closely connected with those of atonement and satisfaction, and thus belonging to some of the deepest mysteries of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>. It is the teaching of that Faith that man is a creature who has fallen from an original state of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in which he was created, and that through the Incarnation, Passion, and Death of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, he has been redeemed and restored again in a certain degree to the original condition. Although <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> might have condoned men's offences gratuitously if He had chosen to do so, yet in His Providence He did not do this; He judged it better to demand satisfaction for the injuries which man had done Him. It is better for man's <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> that wrong doing on his part should entail the necessity of making satisfaction. This satisfaction was made adequately to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Sufferings, Passion, and Death of Jesus Christ</a>, made Man for us. By <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> submission to His <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Passion</a> and Death on the Cross, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> atoned for our disobedience and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. He thus made reparation to the offended majesty of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the outrages which the Creator so constantly suffers at the hands of His creatures. We are restored to grace through the merits of <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">Christ's Death</a>, and that grace enables us to add our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, labours, and trials to those of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord</a> "and fill up those things that are wanting of the <a href="../cathen/11527b.htm">sufferings of Christ</a>" (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs24">Colossians 1:24</a>). We can thus make some sort of reparation to the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for our own offences against Him, and by virtue of the Communion of the Saints, the oneness and solidarity of the mystical Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we can also make satisfaction and reparation for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others.

<p>This <a href="../cathen/14580x.htm">theological</a> <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a>, firmly rooted in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian Faith</a>, is the foundation of the numerous confraternities and pious associations which have been founded, especially in modern times, to make reparation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of men. Thus the Archconfraternity of Reparation for <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> and the neglect of Sunday was founded 28 June, 1847, in the Church of St. Martin de La Noue at St. Dizier in <a href="../cathen/06166a.htm">France</a> by Mgr. Parisis, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/08789c.htm">Langres</a>. With a similar object, the Archconfraternity of the Holy Face was established at <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>, about 1851, through the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of M. Dupont, the "holy man of <a href="../cathen/15002a.htm">Tours</a>". In 1883 an association was formed in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to offer reparation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> on behalf of all nations. The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of reparation is an essential element in the devotion of the Sacred Heart (see Heart of Jesus, Devotion to the).

<p>The Mass, the representation of the sacrifice of Calvary, is specially suited to make reparation for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. One of the ends for which it is offered is the propitiation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> wrath. A <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of <a href="../cathen/11480c.htm">Paris</a> conceived the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of promoting this object in 1862. By the authority of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Pope Leo XIII</a> the erection of the Archconfraternity of the Mass of Reparation was sanctioned in 1886.
