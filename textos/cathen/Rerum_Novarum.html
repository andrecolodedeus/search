<h1>Rerum Novarum</h1>  

<p>The opening words and the title of the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> issued by <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a>, 15 May, 1891, on the "Condition of Labour". Although the <a href="../cathen/05413a.htm">Encyclical</a> follows the lines of the traditional teaching concerning the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of <a href="../cathen/12462a.htm">property</a> and the relations of employer and employee, it applies the old doctrines specifically to modern conditions. Opening with a description of the grievances of the <a href="../cathen/08719a.htm">working</a> classes, it proceeds to refute the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">false</a> theories of the Socialists, and to defend the right of private ownership. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> remedy, continues the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">pope</a>, is to be found in the combined action of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the State, the employer and the employed. The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is properly interested in the social question because of its religious and moral aspects; the State has the right and the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duty</a> to intervene on behalf of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and individual and social well-being; and employers and workers should organize into both mixed and separate associations for mutual protection and for self protection. All this is set forth with sufficient detail to reach the principal problems and relations of industrial and social life.

<p>Probably no other pronouncement on the social question has had so many readers or exercised such a wide influence. It has inspired a vast <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> social literature, while many non-Catholics have acclaimed it as one of the most definite and reasonable productions ever written on the subject. Sometimes criticized as vague, it is as specific as any document could be written for several countries in different stages of industrial development. On one point it is strikingly definite: "Let it be taken for granted that workman and employer should, as a rule, make free agreements, and in particular should agree freely as to wages; nevertheless, there is a dictate of natural <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> more imperious and ancient than any bargain between man and man, that remuneration should be sufficient to maintain the wage-earner in reasonable and frugal comfort. If through necessity or fear of a worse <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> the workman accept harder conditions because an employer or contractor will afford him no better, he is made the victim of force and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>.". Although this <a href="../cathen/05075b.htm">doctrine</a> had been a part of the traditional teaching for many centuries, it had never been stated with such precision and authority. As the years go by and thoughtful men realize more and more how difficult it is to define the full requirements of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in the matter of wages, a constantly increasing number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> look up on this statement of <a href="../cathen/09169a.htm">Leo XIII</a> as the most fruitful and effective principle of industrial <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that has ever been enunciated.
