<h1>Resurrection of Jesus Christ</h1>  

<p>Resurrection is the rising again from the dead, the resumption of <a href="../cathen/09238c.htm">life</a>. In this article, we shall treat only of the Resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. (The <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">General Resurrection of the Body</a> will be covered in another article.) The fact of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Resurrection, the theories opposed to this fact, its characteristics, and the reasons for its importance must be considered in distinct paragraphs.
<h2 id="section1">The fact of Christ's resurrection</h2>

<p>The main sources which directly attest the fact of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Resurrection are the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05509a.htm">Epistles</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a>. <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> morning is so rich in incident, and so crowded with interested <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, that its complete history presents a rather complicated tableau. It is not surprising, therefore, that the partial accounts contained in each of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Four Gospels</a> appear at first sight hard to harmonize. But whatever exegetic view as to the visit to the sepulchre by the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and the appearance of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> we may defend, we cannot deny the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>' agreement as to the fact that the risen <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appeared to one or more <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. According to St. Matthew, He appeared to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and again on a mountain in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>; according to St. Mark, He was seen by <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a>, by the two disciples at <a href="../cathen/05405a.htm">Emmaus</a>, and the Eleven before his <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a> into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; according to St. Luke, He walked with the disciples to <a href="../cathen/05405a.htm">Emmaus</a>, appeared to Peter and to the assembled disciples in <a href="../cathen/08344a.htm">Jerusalem</a>; according to St. John, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> appeared to <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a>, to the ten Apostles on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a>, to the Eleven a week later, and to the seven disciples at the <a href="../cathen/14716b.htm">Sea of Tiberias</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">St. Paul</a> (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs3">1 Corinthians 15:3-8</a>) enumerates another series of apparitions of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> after His Resurrection; he was seen by <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Cephas</a>, by the Eleven, by more than 500 brethren, many of whom were still alive at the time of the Apostle's writing, by James, by all the Apostles, and lastly by Paul himself.

<p>Here is an outline of a possible harmony of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">Evangelists</a>' account concerning the principal events of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a>: <ul><li>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> carrying the spices previously prepared start out for the sepulchre before dawn, and reach it after sunrise; they are anxious about the heavy stone, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of the official guard of the sepulchre (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs1">Matthew 28:1-3</a>; <a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs1">Mark 16:1-3</a>; <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs1">Luke 24:1</a>; <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs1">John 20:1</a>). <li>The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> frightened the guards by his brightness, put them to flight, rolled away the stone, and seated himself not upon (<em>ep autou</em>), but above (<em>epano autou</em>) the stone (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs2">Matthew 28:2-4</a>). <li><a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a>, Mary the Mother of James, and Salome approach the sepulchre, and see the stone rolled back, whereupon <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a> immediately returns to inform the Apostles (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs4">Mark 16:4</a>; <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs2">Luke 24:2</a>; <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs1">John 20:1-2</a>). <li>The other two <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> enter the sepulchre, find an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> seated in the <a href="../cathen/15387a.htm">vestibule</a>, who shows them the empty sepulchre, announces the Resurrection, and commissions them to tell the disciples and Peter that they shall see <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs5">Matthew 28:5-7</a>; <a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs5">Mark 16:5-7</a>). <li>A second group of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, consisting of Joanna and her companions, arrive at the sepulchre, where they have probably agreed to meet the first group, enter the empty interior, and are admonished by two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> has risen according to His prediction (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs10">Luke 24:10</a>). <li>Not long after, Peter and John, who were notified by <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a>, arrive at the sepulchre and find the linen cloth in such a position as to exclude the supposition that the body was <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">stolen</a>; for they lay simply flat on the ground, showing that the sacred body had vanished out of them without touching them. When John notices this he believes (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs3">John 20:3-10</a>). <li><a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a> returns to the sepulchre, sees first two <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> within, and then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Himself (<a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs11">John 20:11-16</a>; <a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs9">Mark 16:9</a>). <li>The two groups of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, who probably met on their return to the city, are favored with the sight of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> arisen, who commissions them to tell His brethren that they will see him in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs8">Matthew 28:8-10</a>; <a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs8">Mark 16:8</a>). <li>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> relate their experiences to the Apostles, but find no <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs10">Mark 16:10-11</a>; <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs9">Luke 24:9-11</a>). <li><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> appears to the disciples, at <a href="../cathen/05405a.htm">Emmaus</a>, and they return to Jerusalem; the Apostles appear to waver between <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs12">Mark 16:12-13</a>; <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs13">Luke 24:13-35</a>). <li><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> appears to Peter, and therefore Peter and John firmly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the Resurrection (<a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs34">Luke 24:34</a>; <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs8">John 20:8</a>). <li>After the return of the disciples from <a href="../cathen/05405a.htm">Emmaus</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> appears to all the Apostles excepting Thomas (<a href="../bible/mar016.htm#vrs14">Mark 16:14</a>; <a href="../bible/luk024.htm#vrs36">Luke 24:36-43</a>; <a href="../bible/joh020.htm#vrs19">John 20:19-25</a>).</ul> The harmony of the other apparitions of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> after His Resurrection presents no special difficulties.


<p>Briefly, therefore, the fact of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Resurrection is attested by more than 500 eyewitnesses, whose experience, simplicity, and uprightness of life rendered them incapable of inventing such a fable, who lived at a time when any attempt to deceive could have been easily discovered, who had nothing in this life to gain, but everything to lose by their testimony, whose moral <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> exhibited in their apostolic life can be explained only by their intimate conviction of the objective <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of their message. Again the fact of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Resurrection is attested by the eloquent silence of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">Synagogue</a> which had done everything to prevent deception, which could have easily discovered deception, if there had been any, which opposed only sleeping witnesses to the testimony of the Apostles, which did not punish the alleged carelessness of the official guard, and which could not answer the testimony of the Apostles except by threatening them "that they speak no more in this name to any man" (<a href="../bible/act004.htm#vrs17">Acts 4:17</a>). Finally the thousands and millions, both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who believed the testimony of the Apostles in spite of all the disadvantages following from such a <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, in short the origin of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, requires for its explanation the reality of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Resurrection, for the rise of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without the Resurrection would have been a greater <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> than the Resurrection itself.
<h2 id="section2">Opposing theories</h2>

<p>By what means can the evidence for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Resurrection by overthrown? Three theories of explanation have been advanced, though the first two have hardly any adherents in our day.
<h3 id="A">The Swoon theory</h3>

<p>There is the theory of those who assert that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> did not really die upon the cross, that His supposed death was only a temporary swoon, and that His Resurrection was simply a return to consciousness. This was advocated by Paulus ("Exegetisches Handbuch", 1842, II, p. 929) and in a modified form by Hase ("Gesch. Jesu", n. 112), but it does not agree with the data furnished by the Gospels. The scourging and the crown of thorns, the carrying of the cross and the crucifixion, the three hours on the cross and the piercing of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Sufferer's</a> side cannot have brought on a mere swoon. His real death is attested by the <a href="../cathen/03535a.htm">centurion</a> and the soldiers, by the friends of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> and by his most bitter enemies. His stay in a sealed sepulchre for thirty-six hours, in an atmosphere poisoned by the exhalations of a hundred pounds of spices, which would have of itself sufficed to cause death. Moreover, if <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had merely returned from a swoon, the feelings of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> morning would have been those of sympathy rather than those of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and triumph, the Apostles would have been roused to the <a href="../cathen/05215a.htm">duties</a> of a sick chamber rather than to apostolic work, the life of the powerful wonderworker would have ended in ignoble solitude and inglorious obscurity, and His vaunted sinlessness would have changed into His silent approval of a lie as the foundation stone of His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. No wonder that later critics of the Resurrection, like Strauss, have heaped contempt on the old theory of a swoon.
<h3 id="B">The Imposition theory</h3>

<p>The disciples, it is said, stole the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> from the grave, and then proclaimed to men that their Lord had risen. This theory was anticipated by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who "gave a great sum of money to the soldiers, saying: Say you, His disciples came by night, and stole him away when we were asleep" (<a href="../bible/mat028.htm#vrs12">Matthew 28:12 sq.</a>). The same was urged by Celsus (<a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, <a href="../fathers/04162.htm"><em>Against Celsus</em> II.56</a>) with some difference of detail. But to assume that the Apostles with a burden of this kind upon their consciences could have preached a kingdom of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and righteousness as the one great effort of their lives, and that for the sake of that kingdom they could have suffered even unto death, is to assume one of those moral impossibilities which may pass for a moment in the heat of controversy, but must be dismissed without delay in the hour of good reflection.
<h3 id="C">The Vision theory</h3>

<p>This theory as generally understood by its advocates does not allow visions caused by a Divine intervention, but only such as are the product of human agencies. For if a Divine intervention be admitted, we may as well believe, as far as principles are concerned, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> raised <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> from the dead. But where in the present instance are the human agencies which might cause these visions? The <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of a <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection from the grave</a> was familiar to the disciples from their Jewish <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; they had also vague intimations in the prophecies of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>; finally, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> Himself had always associated His Resurrection with the predictions of his death. On the other hand, the disciples' state of mind was one of great excitement; they treasured the memory of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with a fondness which made it almost impossible for them to believe that He was gone. In short, their whole <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> condition was such as needed only the application of a spark to kindle the flame. The spark was applied by <a href="../cathen/09761a.htm">Mary Magdalen</a>, and the flame at once spread with the rapidity and force of a conflagration. What she believed that she had seen, others immediately believed that they must see. Their expectations were fulfilled, and the conviction seized the members of the early Church that the Lord had really risen from the dead.

<p>Such is the vision theory commonly defended by recent critics of the Resurrection. But however ingeniously it may be devised, it is quite impossible from an historical point of view. <ul><li>It is incompatible with the state of mind of the Apostles; the theory presupposes <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and expectancy on the part of the Apostles, while in point of fact the disciples' <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and expectancy followed their vision of the risen Christ. <li>It is inconsistent with the nature of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> manifestations; they ought to have been connected with heavenly glory, or they should have continued the former intimate relations of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> with His disciples, while actually and consistently they presented quite a new phase that could not have been expected. <li>It does not agree with the conditions of the early <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> community; after the first excitement of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter Sunday</a>, the disciples as a body are noted for their cool deliberation rather than the exalted enthusiasm of a community of visionaries. <li>It is incompatible with the length of time during which the apparitions lasted; visions such as the critics suppose have never been known to last long, while some of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> manifestations lasted a considerable period. <li>It is not consistent with the fact that the manifestations were made to numbers at the same instant. <li>It does not agree with the place where most of the manifestations were made: visionary appearances would have been expected in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, while most apparitions of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> occurred in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>. <li>It is inconsistent with the fact that the visions came to a sudden end on the day of <a href="../cathen/01767a.htm">Ascension</a>.</ul>

<p>Keim admits that enthusiasm, nervousness, and <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mental</a> excitement on the part of the disciples do not supply a rational explanation of the facts as related in the Gospels. According to him, the visions were directly granted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the glorified Christ; they may even include a "corporeal appearance" for those who fear that without this they would lose all. But Keim's theory satisfies neither the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, since it abandons all the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of a bodily Resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, nor the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, since it admits many of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>; nor again is it consistent with itself, since it grants <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> special intervention in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, though it starts with the denial of the bodily Resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, which is one of the principal objects of that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.
<h3 id="D">Modernist view</h3>

<p>The Holy Office describes and condemns in the thirty-sixth and thirty-seventh propositions of the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Lamentabili", the views advocated by a <a href="../cathen/10415a.htm">fourth class</a> of opponents of the Resurrection. The former of these propositions reads: "The Resurrection of our Saviour is not properly a fact of the historical order, but a fact of the purely <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural order</a> neither <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> nor provable, which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> consciousness has little by little inferred from other facts." This statement agrees with, and is further explained by the words of Loisy ("Autour d'un petit livre", p. viii, 120-121, 169; "L'Evangile et l'&Eacute;glise", pp. 74-78; 120-121; 171). According to Loisy, firstly, the entrance into life <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> of one risen from the dead is not subject to observation; it is a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a>, hyper-historical fact, not capable of historical <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> alleged for the Resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> are inadequate; the empty sepulchre is only an indirect argument, while the apparitions of the risen <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are open to suspicion on a priori grounds, being sensible impressions of a <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> reality; and they are <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubtful</a> evidence from a critical point of view, on account of the discrepancies in the various Scriptural narratives and the mixed character of the detail connected with the apparitions. Secondly, if one prescinds from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Apostles, the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> does not furnish a certain argument for the fact of the Resurrection. This <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Apostles is concerned not so much with the Resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> as with His <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> life; being based on the apparitions, which are unsatisfactory evidence from an historical point of view, its force is appreciated only by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself; being a development of the <a href="../cathen/07630a.htm">idea</a> of an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messias</a>, it is an evolution of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> consciousness, though it is at the same time a corrective of the <a href="../cathen/13506d.htm">scandal</a> of the Cross. The Holy Office rejects this view of the Resurrection when it condemns the thirty-seventh proposition in the <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> "Lamentabili": "The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> pointed at the beginning no so much to the fact of the Resurrection, as to the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>."

<p>Besides the authoritative rejection of the foregoing view, we may submit the following three considerations which render it untenable:

<p>First, the contention that the Resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> historically is not in accord with <a href="../cathen/13598b.htm">science</a>. Science does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> enough about the limitations and the properties of a body raised from the dead to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> life to warrant the assertion that such a body cannot be perceived by the senses; again in the case of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the empty sepulchre with all its concrete circumstances cannot be explained except by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miraculous Divine intervention</a> as <a href="../cathen/14336b.htm">supernatural</a> in its character as the Resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>. 

<p>Secondly, history does not allow us to regard the <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a> in the Resurrection as the result of a gradual evolution in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> consciousness. The apparitions were not a mere projection of the disciples' <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> hope and expectation; their <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Messianic</a> hope and expectations had to be revived by the apparitions. Again, the Apostles did not begin with preaching the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> life of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but they preached <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Resurrection from the very beginning, they insisted on it as a fundamental fact and they described even some of the details connected with this fact: <a href="../bible/act002.htm">Acts 2:24-31</a>, <a href="../bible/act003.htm">3:15-26</a>, <a href="../bible/act004.htm">4:10</a>, <a href="../bible/act005.htm">5:30</a>, <a href="../bible/act010.htm">10:39-40</a>, <a href="../bible/act013.htm">13:30-37</a>, <a href="../bible/act017.htm">17:31-32</a>; <a href="../bible/rom001.htm">Romans 1:4</a>, <a href="../bible/rom004.htm">4:25</a>, <a href="../bible/rom006.htm">6:4-9</a>, <a href="../bible/rom008.htm">8:11-34</a>, <a href="../bible/rom010.htm">10:7</a>, <a href="../bible/rom014.htm">14:9</a>; <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs4">1 Corinthians 15:4, 13 sqq.</a>; etc. 

<p>Thirdly, the denial of the historical <a href="../cathen/03539b.htm">certainty</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Resurrection involves several historical blunders: it questions the objective reality of the apparitions without any historical grounds for such a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>; it denies the fact of the empty sepulchre in spite of solid historical evidence to the contrary; it questions even the fact of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> burial in <a href="../cathen/07425a.htm">Joseph's sepulchre</a>, though this fact is based on the clear and simply unimpeachable testimony of history.
<h2 id="section3">Character of Christ's resurrection</h2>

<p>The Resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has much in common with the <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">general resurrection</a>; even the transformation of His body and of His bodily life is of the same kind as that which awaits the blessed in their <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">resurrection</a>. But the following peculiarities must be noted: <ul><li><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Resurrection is necessarily a glorious one; it implies not merely the reunion of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but also the glorification of the body. <li><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body was to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no corruption, but rose again soon after death, when sufficient time had elapsed to leave no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the reality of His death. <li><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was the first to rise unto life <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; those raised before Him died again (<a href="../bible/col001.htm#vrs18">Colossians 1:18</a>; <a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs20">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>). <li>As the Divine power which raised <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> from the grave was His own power, He rose from the dead by His own power (<a href="../bible/joh002.htm#vrs19">John 2:19</a>; <a href="../bible/joh010.htm#vrs17">10:17-18</a>). <li>Since the Resurrection had been promised as the main <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Divine mission, it has a greater <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmatic</a> importance than any other fact. "If <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> be not risen again, then is our preaching vain, and your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is also vain" (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs14">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>).</ul>
<h2 id="section4">Importance of the resurrection</h2>

<p>Besides being the fundamental argument for our <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">belief</a>, the Resurrection is important for the following reasons: <ul><li>It shows the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who exalted <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> to a life of glory, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had humbled Himself unto death (<a href="../bible/phi002.htm#vrs8">Philippians 2:8-9</a>). <li>The Resurrection completed the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and <a href="../cathen/12677d.htm">redemption</a>; by His death <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> freed us from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and by His Resurrection He restored to us the most important privileges lost by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (<a href="../bible/rom004.htm#vrs25">Romans 4:25</a>). <li>By His Resurrection we acknowledge <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> as the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the efficient and exemplary cause of <a href="../cathen/12792a.htm">our own resurrection</a> (<a href="../bible/1co015.htm#vrs21">1 Corinthians 15:21</a>; <a href="../bible/phi003.htm#vrs20">Philippians 3:20-21</a>), and as the model and the support of our new life of grace (<a href="../bible/rom006.htm#vrs4">Romans 6:4-6 and 9-11</a>).</ul>
