<h1>Reuss</h1>  

<p>Name of the two smallest states of the German Confederation, which lie almost in the centre of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a>, east of <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a>, on the western boundaries of the Kingdom of Saxony. Their united area is 440 sq. miles. Reuss alterer Linie, or Reuss-Greitz, comprises 122 sq. miles and in 1905 its population was 70,603, of whom 68,549 were <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, 1205 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and 54 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Reuss j&uuml;ngerer Linie, or Reuss-Schleiz, contains 318 sq. miles, and had 144,584 inhabitants in 1905, of whom 140,640 were <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutherans</a>, 2806 <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and 290 <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The present Principality of Reuss and the neighbouring tracts of land were inhabited in early <a href="../cathen/10285c.htm">medieval times</a> by Slavonian races who were civilized and <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> by the German <a href="../cathen/11354a.htm">Emperor Otto I</a> (936-73). In church matters the region was under the Diocese of Zeitz (founded in 968), which became a suffragan of <a href="../cathen/09524b.htm">Magdeburg</a>. On account of the frequent inroads of the <a href="../cathen/14042a.htm">Slavs</a>, the residence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Bishop</a> of Zeitz was removed to Naumburg in 1028, after which the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">see</a> was called Naumburg-Zeitz. Upon its subjection to German authority, the whole province was allotted to the Margraviate of Zeitz. As early as the year 1000, however, Emperor <a href="../cathen/11356a.htm">Otto III</a> permitted the entire part lying on the eastern boundary of <a href="../cathen/14712a.htm">Thuringia</a> to be administered by imperial <em>vogts</em>, or bailiffs (<em>advocati imperii</em>), whence this territory received the name of Vogtland (<em>Terra advocatorum</em>), a designation that has remained to this day a geographical summary for Reuss, especially that part on the Saxon borders. The position of <em>vogt</em> soon became hereditary. The princes of Reuss are descended from the <em>vogts</em> of Weida. Erkenbert I (1122) is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by documentary evidence to have been their ancestor. His successors acquired almost the whole Vogtland by feuds or marriage settlement, although in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries they lost the greater part of their possessions, most of which fell to Saxe-Meissen (the present Kingdom of Saxony). In 1244 the <em>vogt</em> Henry IV entered a German <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. His sons divided his possessions, their seats being respectively at Weide (extinct in 1535), Gera (extinct in 1550), and Plauen. The Plauen branch was sub divided into an elder line that died out in 1572, and a young line. Henry, the founder of the Plauen line (d. about 1300), on account of a visit to <a href="../cathen/13231c.htm">Russia</a> received the surname of "der Reusse" (Ruthenus), whence the name passed to the country; on account of the close relations of that country with the neighbouring Saxon states, <a href="../cathen/09438b.htm">Lutheranism</a> speedily gained a foothold in Reuss.

<p>The rulers joined the Smalkaldic League against the German emperor, and forfeited their possessions, but afterwards recovered them. Henry XXII is notable among the more modern princes of this house for his enmity to <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussia</a>, which he opposed in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, when the <a href="../cathen/12519c.htm">Prussian</a> troops occupied his domain. Henry joined the North German Confederation and the new German empire (1871). He alone of all the confederate princes remained until his death (1902) an implacable enemy of Prince Bismarck and of the conditions created in <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> by the foundation of the empire. His son, Henry XXIV (both in 1878), being incapable of ruling, the regency passed to the princes of the younger line of Reuss. After the death of Henry XXIV, the last scion of the younger line, the Principalities of Reuss-Greiz and Reuss-Schleitz will be united. Since the end of the twelfth century all the male members of the princely house have borne the name of Henry in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Emperor Henry VI of <a href="../cathen/06484b.htm">Germany</a> (1190-7), to whom they were under great <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12700b.htm">Reformation</a> entirely destroyed <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> in Reuss. The few <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> settlers were for a long time deprived of regular religious ministrations. A <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">Brief</a> obtained from the <a href="../cathen/11160a.htm">papal nuncio</a> in <a href="../cathen/15417a.htm">Vienna</a>, 15 March, 1822, by the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Princess Gasparina of Rohan-Rochefort, wife of Henry XIX, placed the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in the domains of the elder line under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">Archbishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/12338a.htm">Prague</a>; and through a <a href="../cathen/03052b.htm">papal Brief</a> of 18 March, 1874, they passed under that of the Vicar apostolic of Saxony. The <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a> of Greiz has existed since 1897 and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">statutes</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregation there, <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 12 April, 1897, received government sanction of 7 June of the same year, together with the grant of a legal status under the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. Priests from the neighbouring countries (Bavaria and Saxony) are not prevented from exercising their spiritual functions.

<p>Excluding Greiz and Frauenreuth, permission of the authorities to hold religious services is required in the towns and villages of the principality. The <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of Reuss-Schleiz were placed under the <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/11383c.htm">Paderborn</a> by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">papal</a> "Congregatio de propaganda fide" of 27 June, 1869, which, however, was not officially recognized, and, when in 1883 the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> of the city of Gera desired a mission with permanent <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the Government made its consent dependent upon the transfer of <a href="../cathen/08567a.htm">jurisdiction</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15401b.htm">Vicar Apostolic </a> of Saxony. This was effected by a <a href="../cathen/04670a.htm">Decree</a> of <a href="../cathen/12456a.htm">Propaganda</a> <a href="../cathen/04636c.htm">dated</a> 7 October, 1889. By a princely <a href="../cathen/12783b.htm">rescript</a> of 14 June, 1894, the status of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> population of Gera was recognized from 1 June. They then received the <a href="../cathen/13055c.htm">rights</a> and privileges of citizens under the <a href="../cathen/09066a.htm">civil law</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12676c.htm">rector</a> of Gera is not debarred from exercising his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">sacerdotal</a> functions in places belonging to his <a href="../cathen/11499b.htm">parish</a>, nor are <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from the neighbouring countries (Saxony and Saxe Weimar). The successful progress of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholicism</a> is retarded in both principalities by lack of means, since neither the state nor the people contribute anything to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and a church tax is not permitted. The <a href="../cathen/09458a.htm">Evangelical-Lutheran Church</a> is supported by state and communal contributions, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> being assessed equally with <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a> for this purpose. The Government does not interfere with its subjects in regard to the change of their religion, establishment of orders, <a href="../cathen/09698a.htm">mixed marriages</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">education</a> of the children of such marriages in either principality. For the most part the principles obtaining in the Kingdom of Saxony prevail in Reuss. Nominally, enjoyment of the privileges of citizenship is independent of creed, but in Reuss-Greiz religious exercises can take place only by express permission. In both principalities no previous permission is required for processions on religious festivals, provided they are carried out in the customary manner. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> processions are not allowed. The public free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">schools</a> are <a href="../cathen/09458a.htm">Evangelical-Lutheran</a> and maintained by political or <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> districts. <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to contribute proportionally as much as <a href="../cathen/12495a.htm">Protestants</a>, although religious instruction in their Faith is never given. A private <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> free <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> (about 200 children) has existed in Gera since 1903, to which neither State nor city contributes. In Greiz the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have succeeded in obtaining a <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> of their own since 1908, with about 130 children who are of compulsory <a href="../cathen/13554b.htm">school</a> age. The grant of an appropriation for a high school is still pending (1911).
